Please???? \ud83e\udde0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udde0 : Girl. Seriously though. What the actual fuck is wrong with you? The worst thing about being a scientist 1 is the fact that no matter how hard you work and no matter how diligent you are in learning skills that fall outside your core discipline, you will on a regular basis get slammed by outside context problems . You are trained to work within a particular framework, and you are exquisitely skilled at handling situations that fall within the scope of that framework. You are, almost by definition, a specialist . The days of the \u201crenaissance polymath\u201d are well and truly behind us, simply because science has advanced so far that no human mind can encompass the whole bloody thing at this point. It\u2019s impossible. This is of course a great triumph for science, but a terrible tragedy for the scientist who will always find themselves getting fucked over badly the moment \u201cthe thing I was trained for\u201d turns out to require knowledge from \u201cone of the million other things I was not trained for\u201d. The cruel reality of science is that we feel like fucking morons every single day because there are so very many traps, tripwires, and landmines strewn across the golden fields of science. We all fuck up. All the time. It\u2019s a core part of the job, actually. The trick, if you\u2019re a newly minted scientist hoping to survive in the badlands of real research, is to remain humble in the face complexity. When \u2013 not if \u2013 it happens to you, and you make a mistake, the thing you have to do own it and admit you were wrong. 2 Nobody with a shred of integrity will think less of you for admitting a mistake. And so it is in this spirit that I have to admit there\u2019s a mistake in my GAMLSS post . As of this exact moment of writing I don\u2019t know for certain how bad the mistake is because I haven\u2019t checked yet. 3 I have some reason to think my mistake isn\u2019t terrible , but I don\u2019t know for sure, and I\u2019m about to find out as soon as I write the rest of this post. Not gonna lie, I\u2019m a bit nervous. Survey weights The mistake I made in that post is one that experimentalists such as myself 4 are particularly prone to. I took data from a structured, stratified survey \u2013 in this case the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) \u2013 and analysed it as if it were a simple random sample, which it most certainly is not. In short, I forgot to consider survey weights. The mistake is embarrassing to me because the NHANES website has an entire study design tutorial that talks specifically about this issue 5 and like an idiot 6 I didn\u2019t take it into account. Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh. To understand the nature of my mistake, all you need to do is read the first paragraph of the NHANES tutorial discussing the design of the study: The NHANES samples are not simple random samples. Rather, a complex, multistage, probability sampling design is used to select participants representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population. Oversampling of certain population subgroups is also done to increase the reliability and precision of health status indicator estimates for these particular subgroups. Researchers need to take this into account in their analyses by appropriately specifying the sampling design parameters. Oh. Right. Yeah. Guess which bitch forgot to do that? Guess which bitch is now all of a sudden remembering that lots of surveys use stratified sampling, lot of surveys use oversampling for populations of interest, and lots of surveys discuss survey weights quite prominently on their websites 7 in the hope that researchers don\u2019t make the exact mistake that she did, in fact, make? That\u2019s right, this bitch. Oops. What do survey weights do? So let\u2019s start by thinking about what survey weights are supposed to do. Reduced to the simplest description I can think of, the idea is to introduce a correction factor that adjusts for whatever sampling biases are known to exist in the sample. Suppose, for example, an Australian survey were designed with an intentional 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. There might be reasons for doing this: the population of New South Wales is about 8,500,000 people, whereas Tasmania has only about 580,000 people or thereabouts. If we sampled Australians purely at random, our survey might not have enough Tasmanians in it to be able to say much about Tasmanian residents. Given the differences in population size, you\u2019d expect to see about 15 residents from New South Wales in the sample for every Tasmanian. That could be a problem if we have a need to understand state-by-state differences as well as understand the overall Australian population. Yes, we\u2019d be able to learn about Australia overall, but at the state level we\u2019d learn a lot more about New South Wales and Victoria than we would about Tasmania and South Australia. That\u2019s not ideal. Given this concern, then, we decide to adopt a 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. This means that any individual Tasmanian resident is 5x as likely to be included in the survey than any individual resident of New South Wales. We\u2019ll still end up with more people from New South Wales (because the actual population difference is 15x not 5x), but the final sample will now only have about 3x as many folks from New South Wales as from Tasmania. It\u2019s different, certainly, but we\u2019ll now be able to learn the things that we need to learn at the state-by-state level. The drawback to oversampling Tasmanians, however, is that the sample is now unrepresentative of the nation as a whole. If you want to construct estimates of some quantity for the whole nation, we have to give each NSW resident in the sample 5x the weight that we give to each Tasmanian, in order to correct for the Tasmanian oversampling. This correction factor is the survey weight , and it needs to be taken into account when analysing data from our survey. To be a little more precise about it, here\u2019s the description that the Australian Bureau of Statistics uses to describe survey weights as they apply to the Survey of Income and Housing: Weighting is the process of adjusting results from a sample survey to infer results for the total in scope population whether that be persons or households. To do this, a weight is allocated to each sample unit (e.g.\u00a0a person or a household). The weight is a value which indicates how many population units are represented by the sample unit. The first step in calculating weights for each unit is to assign an initial weight, which is the inverse of the probability of being selected in the survey. For example, if the probability of a household being selected in the survey was 1 in 600, then the household would have an initial weight of 600 (that is, it represents 600 households). Crudely put, the survey weight is a measure of \u201chow many individuals in the population does this sampled row represent?\u201d. In my hypothetical survey with Tasmanian oversampling, each surveyed person from NSW represents 5x as many Australians as each surveyed Tasmanian, and hence those data should weighted 5x as highly when making calculations about Australia as a whole. So now we return to my GAMLSS post and it\u2019s clearer why the models I developed weren\u2019t ideal: the NHANES data set contains survey weights (in a few different forms, actually) and I forgot to take them into account when fitting my models for population height and weight. In hindsight, it\u2019s obvious really. How bad was my mistake? So let\u2019s revisit my GAMLSS modelling for the NHANES data set. The nhanes data frame shown below is very similar to the one I used last time, with two substantial differences: I\u2019ve restricted it to the 10 year period 2009-2018 and added a survey_wt column that constructs the appropriate 10-year survey weight for these data: 8 Code for NHANES data import and preprocessing # directories post_dir <- rprojroot :: find_root_file ( criterion = rprojroot :: has_file ( \".here\" ) ) local_dir <- fs :: path (post_dir, \"nhanes\" ) data_dir <- fs :: path (local_dir, \"data\" ) output_dir <- fs :: path (local_dir, \"output\" ) # conversion based on NHANES average length_to_height <- function (length_cm) { length_cm - 1.06 } # all demographics and body measurement files for the 5 two-year cycles # spanning the decade from 2009 to 2018 demo_files <- fs :: dir_ls (fs :: path (data_dir, \"demo\" ), regexp = \"[FGHIJ] \\\\ .xpt\" ) bmx_files <- fs :: dir_ls (fs :: path (data_dir, \"bmx\" ), regexp = \"[FGHIJ] \\\\ .xpt\" ) # read demographics file (selected variables only) demos <- demo_files |> purrr :: map (\\(xx) { dd <- haven :: read_xpt (xx) if ( !

Noting this, let\u2019s fit a model for height by age, similar to what I did in my GAMLSS post. This time around I\u2019ll do it in two wats, one version using the weights and another version ignoring the weights.

Thankfully for us, they look very, very similar: Code to compute and plot quantiles get_pars <- function (data, model) { pars <- tibble :: tibble ( mu    = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"mu\" ), sigma = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"sigma\" ), nu    = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"nu\" ), tau   = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"tau\" ), ) dplyr :: bind_cols (data, pars) } age_max_yr <- 40 predict_cases <- tidyr :: expand_grid ( age_mn  = 1 : (age_max_yr * 12 ), weighted = c ( TRUE , FALSE ) ) predict_pars <- dplyr :: bind_rows ( predict_cases |> dplyr :: filter (weighted == TRUE ) |> dplyr :: select ( - weighted) |> get_pars (height_mod $ weighted) |> dplyr :: mutate ( model_type = \"weighted\" ), predict_cases |> dplyr :: filter (weighted == FALSE ) |> dplyr :: select ( - weighted) |> get_pars (height_mod $ unweighted) |> dplyr :: mutate ( model_type = \"unweighted\" ) ) predict_quantiles <- predict_pars |> dplyr :: mutate ( q05 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 05 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q25 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 25 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q50 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 50 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q75 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 75 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q95 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 95 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), age_yr = age_mn / 12 ) predict_quantiles_long <- predict_quantiles |> tidyr :: pivot_longer ( cols = dplyr :: starts_with ( \"q\" ), names_to = \"quantile\" , values_to = \"height_cm\" ) predict_quantiles_compare <- predict_quantiles_long |> dplyr :: select (age_mn, age_yr, height_cm, quantile, model_type) |> tidyr :: pivot_wider ( names_from = model_type, values_from = height_cm ) ggplot2 :: ggplot () + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( data = nhanes |> dplyr :: filter (age_yr < age_max_yr), mapping = ggplot2 :: aes (age_mn, height_cm), size = . 25 ) + ggplot2 :: geom_path ( data = predict_quantiles_long, mapping = ggplot2 :: aes (age_mn, height_cm, color = quantile) ) + ggplot2 :: facet_wrap ( ~ model_type) + ggplot2 :: theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) To illustrate the point slightly more precisely, the graphs below plot the quantiles estimated from the weighted model directly against those estimated by from the unweighted model. When drawn like this, the two models are indistinguishable: Code for the replotting predict_quantiles_compare |> ggplot2 :: ggplot ( mapping = ggplot2 :: aes ( x = unweighted, y = weighted, color = quantile ) ) + ggplot2 :: geom_abline ( intercept = 0 , slope = 1 ) + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( size = 3 , alpha = . 1 , show.legend = FALSE ) + ggplot2 :: facet_wrap ( ~ quantile) Well thank fuck. Now, this is not to say that the models are literally identical. There are systematic differences between the unweighted and weighted models, which show up the moment if we plot the differences between the two versions of the model on the y-axis, but the key thing here is to pay attention to the scale of the y-axis. Even for adults, where you might worry that systematic oversampling in NHANES might start to make a difference, the differences between the two models are never larger than a 2cm discrepancy: Code for the residuals plot predict_quantiles_compare |> ggplot2 :: ggplot ( mapping = ggplot2 :: aes ( x = age_yr, y = unweighted - weighted, color = quantile ) ) + ggplot2 :: geom_hline ( yintercept = 0 ) + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( size = 1 ) This makes clear that I did make a mistake \u2013 that part is still true \u2013 but thankfully the discrepancies between what the correctly weighted model predicts and what my original unweighted model predicts are pretty small. In the context of the analyses that I described in the original GAMLSS post and \u2013 much more importantly \u2013 the real world analyses in which I\u2019ve used an unweighted model when I should have used a weighted model, the scale of the discrepancy is so small that it won\u2019t affect any of the \u201cdownstream\u201d analyses. I\u2019m not going to have to send an emergency mea culpa to anyone. The conclusions of my analyses won\u2019t change. Again, thank fuck. Survey weights matter \ud83e\udde0 : So we\u2019re done now, right? You\u2019ve made your mea culpa, you\u2019ve outlined the reasons why the specific worry doesn\u2019t alter the inferences that would be made in the contexts we\u2019ve had to do this kind of work. Very diligent of us. Much proud. Very detail. Et cetera. We can stop now, yes? We\u2019ve done our duty admirably, thanks to your whining and panic. It can end now, yes? No more words need to be written? \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : Okay, about that\u2026 The truth is that I\u2019ve gotten lucky in my analyses, and so have all the other people who have used NHANES data the same way I have. 9 I forgot to take account of something that can matter, and I was fortunate enough that in my specific use cases it didn\u2019t matter. But the nature of luck is that you aren\u2019t always lucky. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. It is not too difficult to come up with examples where the survey weights really do matter, and the rest of the post will be devoted to a one such case. My example is a little artificial, but it will suffice. For the purposes of this example I\u2019m going to focus on the data from the 2015-2018 period, corresponding to the 2-year release cycles labelled \u201cI\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d in the data files. As described in the sample design report for this period, the oversampled subgroups during this period were: Hispanic persons; Non-Hispanic black persons; Non-Hispanic, non-black Asian persons; Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities at or below 185% of the federal poverty level; and Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities aged 0\u201311 years or 80 years and over. The language is oddly stilted, presumably because the authors of the report are being admirably cautious and have defined the groups using a set of non-overlapping categories. But if we were to be a little more informal, we\u2019d notice that these are the oversampled demographics: Hispanic people Black people Asian people Low-income people Young people Old people This makes sense for NHANES. I\u2019m not privvy to their decision making process but I think I can guess the logic: Hispanic, Black, and Asian demographics are oversampled for the same reason that Tasmanians are oversampled in my hypothetical survey at the beginning. They are minority demographics for which we might need to boost the sample size to allow group-by-group comparisons to work. In contrast, I suspect lower-income people, younger people, and older people are all oversampled because NHANES is primarily a survey about health and nutrition, and these three groups are at higher risk of concerns than the rest of the population. Noting all this, let\u2019s construct an example that deliberately exploits the structure of this oversampling in order to show why sample weights matter. One of the questions in the NHANES demographic survey asks about country of birth. The question is (on purpose, I suspect) quite coarse-grained. It just asks if you were born in the United States or not, that\u2019s it. Here\u2019s a version of the NHANES data that includes a column for us_born : Code for NHANES data import and preprocessing # demographics files of relevance demo_files <- fs :: dir_ls (fs :: path (data_dir, \"demo\" ), regexp = \"[IJ] \\\\ .xpt\" ) # read and process demographics file (selected variables only) nhanes_2 <- demo_files |> purrr :: map (\\(xx) { dd <- haven :: read_xpt (xx) dd <- dplyr :: select (dd, SEQN, RIAGENDR, RIDAGEYR, RIDEXAGM, DMDBORN4, WTINT2YR) dd }) |> dplyr :: bind_rows ( .id = \"file_demo\" ) |> dplyr :: mutate ( file_demo = fs :: path_file (file_demo)) |> dplyr :: select ( id          = SEQN, sex_s       = RIAGENDR, # sex/gender at screen (1 = M, 2 = F, . = NA) age_yr      = RIDAGEYR, # natal age at screening (years) survey_wt   = WTINT2YR, # 2-year weight for persons with interview data birth_cnt   = DMDBORN4, # country of birth (1 = US, 2 = other, all other codes NA) file_demo ) |> dplyr :: mutate ( sex_num = sex_s - 1 , # rescale to 0 = M, 1 = F sex_fct = factor (sex_s, levels = 1 : 2 , labels = c ( \"male\" , \"female\" )), us_born = dplyr :: case_when ( birth_cnt == 1 ~ TRUE , birth_cnt == 2 ~ FALSE , TRUE ~ NA ), survey_wt = survey_wt / 2 , # convert from 2-year to 4-year weight cohort = dplyr :: case_when ( file_demo == \"DEMO_I.xpt\" ~ \"2015-2016\" , file_demo == \"DEMO_J.xpt\" ~ \"2017-2018\" , TRUE ~ NA ) ) |> dplyr :: select ( id, sex_fct, age_yr, us_born, survey_wt ) |> dplyr :: filter (age_yr < 80 ) nhanes_2 # A tibble: 18,422 \u00d7 5\n      id sex_fct age_yr us_born survey_wt\n   <dbl> <fct>    <dbl> <lgl>       <dbl>\n 1 83732 male        62 TRUE       67336.\n 2 83733 male        53 FALSE      12164.\n 3 83734 male        78 TRUE        6200.\n 4 83735 female      56 TRUE       51359.\n 5 83736 female      42 TRUE        8814.\n 6 83737 female      72 FALSE       5626.\n 7 83738 female      11 TRUE        4982.\n 8 83739 male         4 TRUE       22375.\n 9 83740 male         1 TRUE        4946.\n10 83741 male        22 TRUE       18522.\n# \u2139 18,412 more rows Now, what I really ought to do here if I were being careful would be to also import variables corresponding to covariates of interest. I could, for example, include those variables that record race and ethnicity information for the NHANES participants. In this case that is especially important, because we know that oversampling is related to race and ethnicity, and we also know on the basis of commonsense that country of bith will also be related to race and ethnicity. 10 A well-constructed analysis of us_born as an outcome variable should include these as explicit covariates. However. I\u2019m not going to do that. I will, on purpose and with malice aforethought, omit critical variables of interest to the substantive problem. My version of the data set includes only two variables that we might use as predictors: age_yr and sex_fct . That\u2019s all you get. That, and the survey_wt variable that will turn out to be critically important because I dropped the other covariates! Noting that I\u2019ve done something malicious in the construction of the data set, let\u2019s move forward and look at what happens when we estimate the proportion of US residents who are also US born, stratified by age and sex. There are two versions of this calculation shown, one that uses the survey weights, and another that ignores them: birth_country <- nhanes_2 |> dplyr :: filter ( ! is.na (us_born)) |> dplyr :: summarise ( us_born_unweighted = mean (us_born), us_born_weighted = sum (us_born * survey_wt) / sum (survey_wt), .by = c (age_yr, sex_fct) ) |> dplyr :: arrange (age_yr) birth_country # A tibble: 160 \u00d7 4\n   age_yr sex_fct us_born_unweighted us_born_weighted\n    <dbl> <fct>                <dbl>            <dbl>\n 1      0 female               0.992            0.994\n 2      0 male                 1                1    \n 3      1 male                 0.982            0.979\n 4      1 female               0.984            0.987\n 5      2 female               0.978            0.982\n 6      2 male                 0.977            0.984\n 7      3 male                 0.951            0.956\n 8      3 female               0.977            0.984\n 9      4 male                 0.969            0.982\n10      4 female               0.976            0.982\n# \u2139 150 more rows Looking at the few rows of this table that you can see in this summary, it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much difference between the weighted and unweighted estimates. However, this is misleading because the only rows you can see here correspond to very young children, and all US-resident infants are also in fact US-born. So all the numbers are above 95% US-born. But once you start looking at every other age group, the story is going to change. And so without further ado, let\u2019s draw a plot\u2026 birth_country |> tidyr :: pivot_longer ( cols = c (us_born_unweighted, us_born_weighted), names_to = \"method\" , values_to = \"us_born\" , names_prefix = \"us_born_\" ) |> ggplot2 :: ggplot (ggplot2 :: aes ( x = age_yr, y = us_born, colour = method )) + ggplot2 :: geom_smooth ( method = \"loess\" , formula = y ~ x ) + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( size = 2 ) + ggplot2 :: facet_wrap ( ~ sex_fct) + ggplot2 :: theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) I\u2019ve used loess regression rather than gamlss regression because I honestly do not have the energy to fit more gamlss models, but you\u2019ll get roughly the same results with any flexible regression method. Looking at the plots, you can see that some aspects to the story remain the same no matter how you analyse the data: the proportion of overseas-born US residents is highest among people aged around 40 or thereabouts. Ingoring the sample weights (red curves) doesn\u2019t distort the correct answer (blue curves) in that respect, or at least not by very much. But that\u2019s about the only thing it doesn\u2019t distort. In every other respect the differences between the blue curves and the red curves are huuuuuuuuuge. The oversampling focuses on groups that are more likely to have been born outside the US, so inevitably it turns out that the sample weights make a huge difference. If you forget to look at the survey weights you\u2019d think that only 60% of middle-aged US residents were born in the US. Taking survey weights into account, however, we see that the correct answer is closer to 80%. That\u2026 yeah, that matters. In short \u2013 sometimes survey weights don\u2019t affect your results, but sometimes they really, really do. Epilogue \ud83e\udde0 : But seriously though, why did you make me do all this? I get that you always feel anxiety anytime you realise that there was some imperfection in something we\u2019ve done in the past, but it wasn\u2019t too hard to convince ourselves that the imperfection in question didn\u2019t affect anything of importance that we actually did. Doesn\u2019t this feel like overkill to you? \ud83e\udec0 : Maybe, I guess, but admit it\u2026 you feel better knowing that we investigated properly and documented the nature of our thinking in a way that might help other people who could also be tripped up the same way. You do, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you get a sense of joy and love from doing this? \ud83e\udde0 : Not really? You\u2019re the one with the heart emoji, babe. You\u2019re the touchy-feely one who wants so desperately to help people, and who panics disproportionately at even the smallest possibility of us having made a mistake. I\u2019m the one who actually has to do the reading and build the bloody models. This shit is exhausting. \ud83e\udec0 : Okay I get that, but also\u2026 isn\u2019t it possible that my anxiety is the thing that motivates us both to learn new things, and my need to help others is the thing that drives us to make the blog posts that people like so much? \ud83e\udde0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udde0 : I guess. But it\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting paid for this shit sweetie. We\u2019re doing this almost entirely out of the goodness of your heart, not mine. I\u2019d have preferred to spend my weekend on something else. We could have read a book, watched some TV, or\u2026 you know, lived our own lives. Doesn\u2019t that also seem worthy to you? Is anxiety and a desperate desire to be loved really a rational basis for choosing your behaviour? \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : Fair point but\u2026 would you really want to be one of those people who only does things for the love of money? Do want to be someone whose only real goal in life is to make number go up in the bank balance? \ud83e\udde0 : I\u2026 suppose not. But like\u2026 could you possibly just chill the fuck out sometimes? The anxiety is a bit over the top my dear, and it\u2019s not that pleasant to live with. \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : Maybe? Look, I\u2019ll try, okay? No promises. \ud83e\udde0 : Sigh. Resources For a post like this one, where I don\u2019t have strong expertise of my own and am writing it with the primary goal of improving my skills, I\u2019m a little wary about suggesting references for others. But for what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s some open access resources I relied on while writing this post: The NHANES study design tutorial provides a helpful overview of how to work with the sample weights that come supplied with the NHANES data. Along similar lines, I found it helpful to compare their notes with the weights page on the Australian Survey of Income and Housing website. There\u2019s a nice page on the Pew Research Center website containing notes by Andrew Mercer, Arnold Lau, and Courtney Kennedy on how different weighting methods work . If you read it on its own it\u2019s brief and helpful, is a nice entry point if you\u2019re an inveterate experimentalist at heart and survey data isn\u2019t your strength. Better yet, it\u2019s not a standalone document, it\u2019s acutally part of a much more comprehensive report on weighting online opt-in samples , so it gives you ample opportunity to branch out. One field in which I know these issues arise often is epidemiology, so it came as little surprise to me to discover that there is a useful chapter on survey analysis chapter contained within The Epidemiologist R Handbook . Another resource I found useful is this online book on how to weight a survey by Josep Espasa Reig. One nice thing about this one is that it\u2019s an informal walkthrough using examples in R, and it\u2019s intended to be readable by social scientists without any much expertise in the area. On the software side, here are a few tools I started investigating: the survey R package by Thomas Lumley, and the srvyr package that provides a dplyr -like syntax for it. In addition, after I shared this post on social media several people suggested additional reading material to look at. David Okunlola pointed me to this paper on subpopulation analysis Carl Pearson pointed me to some good discussion on statsexchange , and to another useful blog post on [different kinds of weights] by Thomas Lumley Samer Mouksassi pointed me to some work that he\u2019s done with longitudinal weights Brady West pointed me to this annual review article \u201cAre survey weights needed\u201d Ben Schneider mentioned Andrew Gelman\u2019s \u201cstruggles with survey weights\u201d paper and this reply . Stas Kolenikov very kindly shared a treasure trove of great links: Pfeffermann 1996 Binder and Roberts 2003 Heeringa, West, and Berglund A photo of what an NHANES MEC unit looks like So\u2026 I suppose I have more reading to do Footnotes Aside from, oh idk, just a lil hypothetical here, an authoritarian government gutting science funding, branding scientists as traitors for researching the wrong topics, threatening researchers, and gluing the cobblestones on the road to fascism in place using the blood and tears of those scientists that have the gall to care about human beings that aren\u2019t themselves.\u21a9\ufe0e I am currently giving very serious side eye at Uri Simonsohn in this regard. Stop being a dick, dude. You fucked up because you ventured outside your area of expertise, and you\u2019ve been gently corrected in the literature by people who know this stuff better than you do. And that\u2019s okay, as long as you stop doubling down on the mistake. Just a thought from a girl who no longer has skin in that particular game.\u21a9\ufe0e I suppose if you really want to check you can take a look at the git log on the blog repo and confirm that yep, I\u2019m writing this introductory section before writing any of the code to investigate the mistake. The anxiety is real.\u21a9\ufe0e I mean, it\u2019s now been about 5 years since the last time I actually ran an experiment of my very own. I\u2019m a data analyst by trade now, and unlike my old discipline of mathematical psychology where analysts tend to also run their own experiments, pharmacometricians tend not to conduct the studies they analyse themselves. Nevertheless, both disciplines are built atop a foundation of experimental science, and I notice that pharmacometricians tend to think in ways I find very familiar as a former math psych girl.\u21a9\ufe0e My sincere thanks to Benjamin Rich and Thomas Lumley who, in different contexts, both found very gentle ways to point me in the right direction. I mean, I did sort of know I had to think about this but I just\u2026 didn\u2019t.\u21a9\ufe0e In my defence, I was not an idiot. I was an analyst operating under time pressure, and I missed a detail that in hindsight I should have paid more attention to. Sigh. But it happens to us all, and in an attempt to practice what I preach, I\u2019m admitting it openly.\u21a9\ufe0e As another example, here\u2019s the Australian Survey of Income and Housing , and lo and behold it has a page explicitly discussing survey weights for the study.\u21a9\ufe0e You can inspect the code to see the actual calculations but in short, I used the \u201cMEC\u201d weights (weights associated with the data collected via the mobile examination centre) and - noting that the weights are commensurate over this period, constructed the 10-year weight by dividing the 2-year weight by 5 when the data for 5 2-year cycles are aggregated. The NHANES study design tutorial goes into details on this.\u21a9\ufe0e You know who you are. We\u2019ve all made this mistake once or twice \u263a\ufe0f. \u2019Tis the nature of the beast if you\u2019re working as an applied data analyst at the coalface. You get slammed with client requests that come in faster than you can handle, always with an externally-imposed deadline that you cannot change. You do the best you can in the limited timeframe that is permitted. That\u2019s all you can do.\u21a9\ufe0e Amusing side-note. It\u2019s always worth remembering that race and ethnicity categories aren\u2019t \u201cnatural categories\u201d in the sense that they map onto true and unyielding permanent categories in the world. When I work for Japanese clients, for example, their data set use race and ethnicity categories that are defined completely differently to how American clients define these things. Australian data sets define these things differently from American data sets also. The somewhat artificial nature of these categories means you should be careful when working with them in data sets, but also (and more entertainingly) lead to hilarious side effects. The formal definition of \u201cHispanic\u201d as used in a lot of US surveys is constructed around family ancestry, and usually around whether you or your parents were born in a Spanish-speaking country. Hilariously, to my mind, Spain is not excluded from the list of countries. So if your family comes from Spain (as mine does on one side) you are \u201ctechnically\u201d Hispanic, but not if your family comes from Portugal. Yes this is absurd. It means that the US considers me Hispanic. By any common sense understanding of what \u201cHispanic\u201d refers to, I am not Hispanic. But that is the nature of administrative categories: they are crude.\u21a9\ufe0e Reuse CC BY 4.0 Citation BibTeX citation: @online{navarro2025,\n  author = {Navarro, Danielle},\n  title = {Some Notes on Survey Weights},\n  date = {2025-09-27},\n  url = {https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/},\n  langid = {en}\n} For attribution, please cite this work as: Navarro, Danielle. 2025. \u201cSome Notes on Survey Weights.\u201d September 27, 2025. https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/ .",

What the actual fuck is wrong with you?</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p>The worst thing about being a scientist<sup>1</sup> is the fact that no matter how hard you work and no matter how diligent you are in learning skills that fall outside your core discipline, you will on a regular basis get slammed by <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem\">outside context problems</a>. You are trained to work within a particular framework, and you are exquisitely skilled at handling situations that fall within the scope of that framework. You are, almost by definition, a <em>specialist</em>. The days of the \u201crenaissance polymath\u201d are well and truly behind us, simply because science has advanced so far that no human mind can encompass the whole bloody thing at this point. It\u2019s impossible.</p>\n<p>This is of course a great triumph for science, but a terrible tragedy for the scientist who will <em>always</em> find themselves getting fucked over badly the moment \u201cthe thing I was trained for\u201d turns out to require knowledge from \u201cone of the million other things I was not trained for\u201d. The cruel reality of science is that we feel like fucking morons every single day because there are so very many traps, tripwires, and landmines strewn across the golden fields of science.</p>\n<p>We all fuck up. All the time. It\u2019s a core part of the job, actually. The trick, if you\u2019re a newly minted scientist hoping to survive in the badlands of real research, is to remain humble in the face complexity. When \u2013 not if \u2013 it happens to you, and you make a mistake, the thing you have to do own it and admit you were wrong.<sup>2</sup> Nobody with a shred of integrity will think less of you for admitting a mistake.</p>\n<p>And so it is in this spirit that I have to admit there\u2019s a mistake in my <a href=\"../../posts/2025-09-07_gamlss/\">GAMLSS post</a>. As of this exact moment of writing I don\u2019t know for certain how bad the mistake is because I haven\u2019t checked yet.<sup>3</sup> I have some reason to think my mistake isn\u2019t <em>terrible</em>, but I don\u2019t know for sure, and I\u2019m about to find out as soon as I write the rest of this post.</p>\n<p>Not gonna lie, I\u2019m a bit nervous.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"survey-weights\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">Survey weights</h2>\n<p>The mistake I made in that post is one that experimentalists such as myself<sup>4</sup> are particularly prone to. I took data from a structured, stratified survey \u2013 in this case the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/\">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a> (NHANES) \u2013 and analysed it as if it were a simple random sample, which it most certainly is not. In short, I forgot to consider <strong>survey weights.</strong> The mistake is embarrassing to me because the NHANES website has an entire <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/sampledesign.aspx\">study design tutorial</a> that talks specifically about this issue<sup>5</sup> and like an idiot<sup>6</sup> I didn\u2019t take it into account. Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.</p>\n<p>To understand the nature of my mistake, all you need to do is read the first paragraph of the NHANES tutorial discussing the design of the study:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>The NHANES samples are not simple random samples. Rather, a complex, multistage, probability sampling design is used to select participants representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population. Oversampling of certain population subgroups is also done to increase the reliability and precision of health status indicator estimates for these particular subgroups. Researchers need to take this into account in their analyses by appropriately specifying the sampling design parameters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh. Right. Yeah. Guess which bitch forgot to do that? Guess which bitch is now all of a sudden remembering that <em>lots</em> of surveys use stratified sampling, <em>lot</em> of surveys use oversampling for populations of interest, and <em>lots</em> of surveys discuss survey weights quite prominently on their websites<sup>7</sup> in the hope that researchers don\u2019t make the exact mistake that she did, in fact, make? That\u2019s right, this bitch.</p>\n<p>Oops.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"what-do-survey-weights-do\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">What do survey weights do?</h2>\n<p>So let\u2019s start by thinking about what survey weights are supposed to do. Reduced to the simplest description I can think of, the idea is to introduce a correction factor that adjusts for whatever sampling biases are known to exist in the sample. Suppose, for example, an Australian survey were designed with an intentional 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. There might be reasons for doing this: the population of New South Wales is about 8,500,000 people, whereas Tasmania has only about 580,000 people or thereabouts. If we sampled Australians purely at random, our survey might not have enough Tasmanians in it to be able to say much about Tasmanian residents. Given the differences in population size, you\u2019d expect to see about 15 residents from New South Wales in the sample for every Tasmanian. That could be a problem if we have a need to understand state-by-state differences as well as understand the overall Australian population. Yes, we\u2019d be able to learn about Australia overall, but at the state level we\u2019d learn a lot more about New South Wales and Victoria than we would about Tasmania and South Australia. That\u2019s not ideal.</p>\n<p>Given this concern, then, we decide to adopt a 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. This means that any <em>individual</em> Tasmanian resident is 5x as likely to be included in the survey than any individual resident of New South Wales. We\u2019ll still end up with more people from New South Wales (because the actual population difference is 15x not 5x), but the final sample will now only have about 3x as many folks from New South Wales as from Tasmania. It\u2019s different, certainly, but we\u2019ll now be able to learn the things that we need to learn at the state-by-state level.</p>\n<p>The drawback to oversampling Tasmanians, however, is that the sample is now unrepresentative of the nation as a whole. If you want to construct estimates of some quantity for the whole nation, we have to give each NSW resident in the sample 5x the weight that we give to each Tasmanian, in order to correct for the Tasmanian oversampling. This correction factor is the <strong>survey weight</strong>, and it needs to be taken into account when analysing data from our survey.</p>\n<p>To be a little more precise about it, here\u2019s the description that the Australian Bureau of Statistics uses to describe survey weights as they apply to the Survey of Income and Housing:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Weighting is the process of adjusting results from a sample survey to infer results for the total in scope population whether that be persons or households. To do this, a weight is allocated to each sample unit (e.g.&nbsp;a person or a household). The weight is a value which indicates how many population units are represented by the sample unit. The first step in calculating weights for each unit is to assign an initial weight, which is the inverse of the probability of being selected in the survey. For example, if the probability of a household being selected in the survey was 1 in 600, then the household would have an initial weight of 600 (that is, it represents 600 households).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Crudely put, the survey weight is a measure of \u201chow many individuals in the population does this sampled row represent?\u201d. In my hypothetical survey with Tasmanian oversampling, each surveyed person from NSW represents 5x as many Australians as each surveyed Tasmanian, and hence those data should weighted 5x as highly when making calculations about Australia as a whole.</p>\n<p>So now we return to my <a href=\"../../posts/2025-09-07_gamlss/\">GAMLSS post</a> and it\u2019s clearer why the models I developed weren\u2019t ideal: the NHANES data set contains survey weights (in a few different forms, actually) and I forgot to take them into account when fitting my models for population height and weight. In hindsight, it\u2019s obvious really.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"how-bad-was-my-mistake\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">How bad was my mistake?</h2>\n<p>So let\u2019s revisit my GAMLSS modelling for the NHANES data set.

You\u2019ve made your mea culpa, you\u2019ve outlined the reasons why the specific worry doesn\u2019t alter the inferences that would be made in the contexts we\u2019ve had to do this kind of work. Very diligent of us. Much proud. Very detail. Et cetera. We can stop now, yes? We\u2019ve done our duty admirably, thanks to your whining and panic. It can end now, yes? No more words need to be written?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : \u2026<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Okay, about that\u2026<br /></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p>The truth is that I\u2019ve gotten lucky in my analyses, and so have all the other people who have used NHANES data the same way I have.<sup>9</sup> I forgot to take account of something that can matter, and I was fortunate enough that in my specific use cases it didn\u2019t matter. But the nature of luck is that you aren\u2019t always lucky. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. It is not too difficult to come up with examples where the survey weights really do matter, and the rest of the post will be devoted to a one such case. My example is a little artificial, but it will suffice.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this example I\u2019m going to focus on the data from the 2015-2018 period, corresponding to the 2-year release cycles labelled \u201cI\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d in the data files. As described in the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02-184-508.pdf\">sample design report</a> for this period, the oversampled subgroups during this period were:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<ul>\n<li>Hispanic persons;</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic black persons;</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic, non-black Asian persons;</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities at or below 185% of the federal poverty level; and</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities aged 0\u201311 years or 80 years and over.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The language is oddly stilted, presumably because the authors of the report are being admirably cautious and have defined the groups using a set of non-overlapping categories. But if we were to be a little more informal, we\u2019d notice that these are the oversampled demographics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hispanic people</li>\n<li>Black people</li>\n<li>Asian people</li>\n<li>Low-income people</li>\n<li>Young people</li>\n<li>Old people</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This makes sense for NHANES. I\u2019m not privvy to their decision making process but I think I can guess the logic: Hispanic, Black, and Asian demographics are oversampled for the same reason that Tasmanians are oversampled in my hypothetical survey at the beginning. They are minority demographics for which we might need to boost the sample size to allow group-by-group comparisons to work. In contrast, I suspect lower-income people, younger people, and older people are all oversampled because NHANES is primarily a survey about health and nutrition, and these three groups are at higher risk of concerns than the rest of the population.</p>\n<p>Noting all this, let\u2019s construct an example that deliberately exploits the structure of this oversampling in order to show why sample weights matter. One of the questions in the NHANES demographic survey asks about country of birth. The question is (on purpose, I suspect) quite coarse-grained. It just asks if you were born in the United States or not, that\u2019s it. Here\u2019s a version of the NHANES data that includes a column for <code>us_born</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<details class=\"code-fold\">\nCode for NHANES data import and preprocessing\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb8\" style=\"background: #f1f3f5;\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb8-1\"><span class=\"co\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E;

I could, for example, include those variables that record race and ethnicity information for the NHANES participants. In this case that is <em>especially</em> important, because we know that oversampling is related to race and ethnicity, and we also know on the basis of commonsense that country of bith will also be related to race and ethnicity.<sup>10</sup> A well-constructed analysis of <code>us_born</code> as an outcome variable should include these as explicit covariates.</p>\n<p>However.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to do that. I will, on purpose and with malice aforethought, omit critical variables of interest to the substantive problem. My version of the data set includes only two variables that we might use as predictors: <code>age_yr</code> and <code>sex_fct</code>. That\u2019s all you get. That, and the <code>survey_wt</code> variable that will turn out to be critically important because I dropped the other covariates!</p>\n<p>Noting that I\u2019ve done something malicious in the construction of the data set, let\u2019s move forward and look at what happens when we estimate the proportion of US residents who are also US born, stratified by age and sex.

Ingoring the sample weights (red curves) doesn\u2019t distort the correct answer (blue curves) in that respect, or at least not by very much. But that\u2019s about the only thing it doesn\u2019t distort. In every other respect the differences between the blue curves and the red curves are huuuuuuuuuge. The oversampling focuses on groups that are more likely to have been born outside the US, so inevitably it turns out that the sample weights make a huge difference. If you forget to look at the survey weights you\u2019d think that only 60% of middle-aged US residents were born in the US. Taking survey weights into account, however, we see that the correct answer is closer to 80%. That\u2026 yeah, that matters.</p>\n<p>In short \u2013 sometimes survey weights don\u2019t affect your results, but sometimes they really, really do.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"epilogue\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">Epilogue</h2>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : But seriously though, why did you make me do all this? I get that you always feel anxiety anytime you realise that there was some imperfection in something we\u2019ve done in the past, but it wasn\u2019t too hard to convince ourselves that the imperfection in question didn\u2019t affect anything of importance that we actually did. Doesn\u2019t this feel like overkill to you?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Maybe, I guess, but admit it\u2026 you feel better knowing that we investigated properly and documented the nature of our thinking in a way that might help other people who could also be tripped up the same way. You do, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you get a sense of joy and love from doing this?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : Not really? You\u2019re the one with the heart emoji, babe. You\u2019re the touchy-feely one who wants so desperately to help people, and who panics disproportionately at even the smallest possibility of us having made a mistake. I\u2019m the one who actually has to do the reading and build the bloody models. This shit is exhausting.<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Okay I get that, but also\u2026 isn\u2019t it possible that my anxiety is the thing that motivates us both to learn new things, and my need to help others is the thing that drives us to make the blog posts that people like so much?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : \u2026<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : I guess. But it\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting paid for this shit sweetie. We\u2019re doing this almost entirely out of the goodness of your heart, not mine. I\u2019d have preferred to spend my weekend on something else. We could have read a book, watched some TV, or\u2026 you know, lived our own lives. Doesn\u2019t that also seem worthy to you? Is anxiety and a desperate desire to be loved really a rational basis for choosing your behaviour?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : \u2026<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Fair point but\u2026 would you really want to be one of those people who only does things for the love of money? Do want to be someone whose only real goal in life is to make number go up in the bank balance?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : I\u2026 suppose not. But like\u2026 could you possibly just chill the fuck out sometimes? The anxiety is a bit over the top my dear, and it\u2019s not that pleasant to live with.<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : \u2026<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : \u2026<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Maybe?

But for what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s some open access resources I relied on while writing this post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/sampledesign.aspx\">NHANES study design tutorial</a> provides a helpful overview of how to work with the sample weights that come supplied with the NHANES data. Along similar lines, I found it helpful to compare their notes with the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/concepts-sources-methods/survey-income-and-housing-user-guide-australia/2019-20/weights\">weights page</a> on the Australian <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/concepts-sources-methods/survey-income-and-housing-user-guide-australia/2019-20\">Survey of Income and Housing</a> website.</p></li>\n<li><p>There\u2019s a nice page on the Pew Research Center website containing notes by Andrew Mercer, Arnold Lau, and Courtney Kennedy on <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2018/01/26/how-different-weighting-methods-work/\">how different weighting methods work</a>. If you read it on its own it\u2019s brief and helpful, is a nice entry point if you\u2019re an inveterate experimentalist at heart and survey data isn\u2019t your strength. Better yet, it\u2019s not a standalone document, it\u2019s acutally part of a much more comprehensive report on <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2018/01/26/for-weighting-online-opt-in-samples-what-matters-most/\">weighting online opt-in samples</a>, so it gives you ample opportunity to branch out.</p></li>\n<li><p>One field in which I know these issues arise often is epidemiology, so it came as little surprise to me to discover that there is a useful chapter on <a href=\"https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/survey_analysis.html\">survey analysis</a> chapter contained within <a href=\"https://epirhandbook.com/en/\">The Epidemiologist R Handbook</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another resource I found useful is this online book on <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/jespasareig/Book_How_to_weight_a_survey/\">how to weight a survey</a> by Josep Espasa Reig. One nice thing about this one is that it\u2019s an informal walkthrough using examples in R, and it\u2019s intended to be readable by social scientists without any much expertise in the area.</p></li>\n<li><p>On the software side, here are a few tools I started investigating: the <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/package=survey\">survey</a> R package by Thomas Lumley, and the <a href=\"http://gdfe.co/srvyr/\">srvyr</a> package that provides a <a href=\"https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/\">dplyr</a>-like syntax for it.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, after I shared this post on social media several people suggested additional reading material to look at.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-okunlola-2687a239/\">David Okunlola</a> pointed me to <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X0800800404\">this paper on subpopulation analysis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://carljpearson.com/ux-research-blog/\">Carl Pearson</a> pointed me to some good discussion on <a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/57107/use-of-weights-in-svyglm-vs-glm\">statsexchange</a>, and to another useful blog post on [different kinds of weights] by Thomas Lumley</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samer-mouksassi-pharm-d-phd-fcp-571555b/\">Samer Mouksassi</a> pointed me to some work that he\u2019s done with <a href=\"https://www.page-meeting.org/pdf_assets/2208-HBGDki-PAGEPoster_v20160520-02Mouksassi.pdf\">longitudinal weights</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.umich.edu/~bwest\">Brady West</a> pointed me to this annual review article <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-statistics-011516-012958\">\u201cAre survey weights needed\u201d</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.practicalsignificance.com/\">Ben Schneider</a> mentioned Andrew Gelman\u2019s <a href=\"https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/STS226.pdf\">\u201cstruggles with survey weights\u201d</a> paper and this <a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-22/issue-2/Comment-Struggles-with-Survey-Weighting-and-Regression-Modeling/10.1214/088342307000000195.pdf\">reply</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://staskolenikov.net/\">Stas Kolenikov</a> very kindly shared a treasure trove of great links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/096228029600500303\">Pfeffermann 1996</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0470867205.ch3\">Binder and Roberts 2003</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://smponline.isr.umich.edu/applied-survey-data-analysis/\">Heeringa, West, and Berglund</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/MNHENNE/2023/01/7078801/picture1_original.jpg\">A photo of what an NHANES MEC unit looks like</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So\u2026 I suppose I have more reading to do</p>\n\n\n</section>\n\n\n<div class=\"default\" id=\"quarto-appendix\"><section class=\"footnotes footnotes-end-of-document\" id=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"anchored quarto-appendix-heading\">Footnotes</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1\"><p>Aside from, oh idk, just a lil hypothetical here, an authoritarian government gutting science funding, branding scientists as traitors for researching the wrong topics, threatening researchers, and gluing the cobblestones on the road to fascism in place using the blood and tears of those scientists that have the gall to care about human beings that aren\u2019t themselves.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn2\"><p>I am currently giving very serious side eye at <a href=\"https://datacolada.org/129\">Uri Simonsohn</a> in this regard. Stop being a dick, dude. You fucked up because you ventured outside your area of expertise, and you\u2019ve been gently corrected in the literature by people who know this stuff better than you do. And that\u2019s okay, as long as you stop doubling down on the mistake. Just a thought from a girl who no longer has skin in that particular game.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn3\"><p>I suppose if you really want to check you can take a look at the git log on the blog repo and confirm that yep, I\u2019m writing this introductory section <em>before</em> writing any of the code to investigate the mistake. The anxiety is real.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn4\"><p>I mean, it\u2019s now been about 5 years since the last time I actually <em>ran</em> an experiment of my very own. I\u2019m a data analyst by trade now, and unlike my old discipline of mathematical psychology where analysts tend to also run their own experiments, pharmacometricians tend not to conduct the studies they analyse themselves. Nevertheless, both disciplines are built atop a foundation of experimental science, and I notice that pharmacometricians tend to think in ways I find very familiar as a former math psych girl.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn5\"><p>My sincere thanks to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminrichphd/\">Benjamin Rich</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-lumley\">Thomas Lumley</a> who, in different contexts, both found very gentle ways to point me in the right direction. I mean, I did sort of know I had to think about this but I just\u2026 didn\u2019t.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn6\"><p>In my defence, I was not an idiot. I was an analyst operating under time pressure, and I missed a detail that in hindsight I should have paid more attention to. Sigh. But it happens to us all, and in an attempt to practice what I preach, I\u2019m admitting it openly.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn7\"><p>As another example, here\u2019s the Australian <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/concepts-sources-methods/survey-income-and-housing-user-guide-australia/2019-20\">Survey of Income and Housing</a>, and lo and behold it has a page explicitly discussing <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/concepts-sources-methods/survey-income-and-housing-user-guide-australia/2019-20/weights\">survey weights</a> for the study.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn8\"><p>You can inspect the code to see the actual calculations but in short, I used the \u201cMEC\u201d weights (weights associated with the data collected via the mobile examination centre) and - noting that the weights are commensurate over this period, constructed the 10-year weight by dividing the 2-year weight by 5 when the data for 5 2-year cycles are aggregated. The <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/sampledesign.aspx\">NHANES study design tutorial</a> goes into details on this.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn9\"><p>You know who you are. We\u2019ve all made this mistake once or twice \u263a\ufe0f. \u2019Tis the nature of the beast if you\u2019re working as an applied data analyst at the coalface. You get slammed with client requests that come in faster than you can handle, always with an externally-imposed deadline that you cannot change. You do the best you can in the limited timeframe that is permitted. That\u2019s all you can do.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn10\"><p>Amusing side-note. It\u2019s always worth remembering that race and ethnicity categories aren\u2019t \u201cnatural categories\u201d in the sense that they map onto true and unyielding permanent categories in the world. When I work for Japanese clients, for example, their data set use race and ethnicity categories that are defined completely differently to how American clients define these things. Australian data sets define these things differently from American data sets also. The somewhat artificial nature of these categories means you should be careful when working with them in data sets, but also (and more entertainingly) lead to hilarious side effects. The formal definition of \u201cHispanic\u201d as used in a lot of US surveys is constructed around family ancestry, and usually around whether you or your parents were born in a Spanish-speaking country. Hilariously, to my mind, Spain is <em>not</em> excluded from the list of countries. So if your family comes from Spain (as mine does on one side) you are \u201ctechnically\u201d Hispanic, but not if your family comes from Portugal. Yes this is absurd. It means that the US considers me Hispanic. By any common sense understanding of what \u201cHispanic\u201d refers to, I am not Hispanic. But that is the nature of administrative categories: they are crude.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n</ol>\n</section><section class=\"quarto-appendix-contents\" id=\"quarto-reuse\"><h2 class=\"anchored quarto-appendix-heading\">Reuse</h2><div class=\"quarto-appendix-contents\"><div><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" rel=\"license\">CC BY 4.0</a></div></div></section><section class=\"quarto-appendix-contents\" id=\"quarto-citation\"><h2 class=\"anchored quarto-appendix-heading\">Citation</h2><div><div class=\"quarto-appendix-secondary-label\">BibTeX citation:</div><pre class=\"sourceCode code-with-copy quarto-appendix-bibtex\"><code class=\"sourceCode bibtex\">@online{navarro2025,\n  author = {Navarro, Danielle},\n  title = {Some Notes on Survey Weights},\n  date = {2025-09-27},\n  url = {https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\n</code></pre><div class=\"quarto-appendix-secondary-label\">For attribution, please cite this work as:</div><div class=\"csl-entry quarto-appendix-citeas\" id=\"ref-navarro2025\">\nNavarro, Danielle. 2025. <span>\u201cSome Notes on Survey Weights.\u201d</span>\nSeptember 27, 2025. <a href=\"https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/\">https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/</a>.\n</div></div></section></div>"

There are peddlers of tonics that claim to\n heal pets from the effects of \u201c<a href=\"https://shoprawdogfood.rawdogfoodandco.com/products/detox-bundle\">toxic preventatives and pharmaceuticals</a>.\u201d There are podcasters trumpeting \u201c<a href=\"https://angelaardolino.com/over-vaccination-with-dr-jeff-grognet/\">the risks of over-vaccination</a>.\u201d There are social media personalities posting scary videos about pet vaccines \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/ValerieAnne1970/status/1956627314965348531\">shedding</a>\u201d onto humans.</p><p>...</p><p>Like\n more than a dozen other states, Colorado offered a loophole for medical\n exemptions. If she could argue that a pet was not healthy in any way, \nJasek would write up a note excusing the animal from the rabies vaccine.\n Most of the time it worked fine, but she says she was twice contacted \nby the state board because people had filed complaints against her. (The\n complaints never led to any disciplinary proceedings.) Once, it was \nanother veterinarian who didn\u2019t believe an exemption was justified. \nAnother time, a client\u2019s unvaccinated dog bit someone.</p>\n\n  \n\n\n  <p>\u201cShe\n kind of threw me under the bus, basically, and said, \u2018Well, Dr. Judy \nsaid I don\u2019t need the vaccines,\u2019 \u201d Jasek told me. \u201cThat isn\u2019t true. I \nmean, I tell people that the vaccines can cause health concerns. \nHowever, when it comes to the laws and the rules, people still have to \nbe accountable.\u201d</p>\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  <p>Rabies outbreaks in wildlife populations are <a href=\"https://beaconbio.org/en/report/?reportid=228441a4-540b-4c15-84ec-ec8df7c569cd&amp;eventid=1a182de8-04e5-450c-8d66-5dc49010b31e\">on the rise</a>\n across the U.S., due in part to human incursion on natural habitats. \nThough the people who have died from rabies exposure in the last year \nhave gotten the disease from wild animals, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rabies-outbreaks-rising-us-deaths-vaccine-rcna227771\">veterinarians worry</a>\n that distrust of pet vaccinations could lead to a resurgence among \ndomestic animals of a virus that is nearly 100 percent fatal in both \nanimals and people.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I encountered the question today of what to do with missing values when conducting null hypothesis testing or regression? I have seen many suggest doing mean imputation. That is, simply replace any missing values with the mean of the variable calculated from the observed values. I argue that mean imputation is worse than doing nothing. Let\u2019s explore. To begin, let\u2019s simulate a vector, x , from the random normal distribution. set.seed(2112)\nx <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n(mean1 <- mean(x)) [1] 0.01129628 (sd1 <- sd(x)) [1] 1.032159 We can see that the mean and standard deviation aver fairly close to 0 and 1, respectively. In the next code chunk we are going to randomly select 20% of observations and set the value to NA . We can calculate the mean and standard deviation excluding the missing values (i.e. NA s) but setting na.rm = TRUE . The mean and standard deviation are relatively close. x[sample(length(x), length(x) * 0.2, replace = FALSE)] <- NA\n(mean2 <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) [1] 0.02136184 (sd2 <- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)) [1] 1.071757 Now we will replace the NA s we introduced above with the mean. We can see that the standard deviation is quite a bit smaller, hence reducing the variance of our estimate. Since many of our statistical tests rely on variance, reducing the variance may lead to spurious conclusions. x[is.na(x)] <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n(mean3 <- mean(x)) [1] 0.02136184 (sd3 <- sd(x)) [1] 0.9573977 To show this is not a random anomaly for our one random sample, let\u2019s repeat the above 1,000 times. n_samples <- 1000\npercent_missing <- 0.10\nsd_diffs <- data.frame(sample = 1:n_samples,\n                       sd_drop_miss = numeric(n_samples),\n                       sd_impute_miss = numeric(n_samples))\nfor(i in seq_len(n_samples)) {\n    x2 <- x\n    x2[sample(length(x), length(x) * percent_missing, replace = FALSE)] <- NA\n    sd_diffs[i,]$sd_drop_miss <- sd(x2, na.rm = TRUE)\n    x2[is.na(x2)] <- mean(x2, na.rm = TRUE)\n    sd_diffs[i,]$sd_impute_miss <- sd(x2)\n}\n\nsd_diffs |> \n    reshape2::melt(id.vars = 'sample', variable.name = 'calculation_type', value.name = 'sd') |>\n    ggplot(aes(x = sd, color = calculation_type)) +\n        geom_vline(xintercept = sd(x)) +\n        geom_density() +\n        xlab('Standard Deviation') +\n        theme_minimal() As the figure above shows, there is a significant difference in the standard deviation estimates when calculated using only observed values and calculated with missing values imputed with the mean.

That\u2019s part of the reason I so enjoyed The Return of the Raven Mocker by Arizona author Donis Casey (2017), which realistically portrays the effects of the 1918 influenza epidemic on the residents of Boynton, Oklahoma. Reading the book started me thinking about differences between clinical trials then and now. This post has spoilers for the epidemic, but none for the whodunit. Protagonist Alafair Tucker believes in her home remedies, but Casey injects a scientific perspective through the character of Dr. Emmett Carney, a researcher at the University of Oklahoma assigned to Boynton during its health emergency. Carney \u201chad been following the work of the virologists and bacteriologists Back East as they desperately tried to develop an effective treatment. He had had some success in reproducing their test results, and had even designed an experimental vaccine of his own\u201d (p. 61). Influenza Vaccine Testing in 1918 Dr. Carney could very plausibly have created a vaccine in 1918 \u2014 or, at least, what he thought was a vaccine. The 1918 influenza epidemic was the deadliest known in human history. \u00b9 Many scientists of the time, seeing the ravages of the disease, were trying to develop vaccines. Influenza was not attributed to a viral cause until the 1930s, however, \u00b2 and vaccine efforts in 1918 focused on bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilis influenzae (then widely thought to cause influenza, hence its name). Dr. Carney did not offer his vaccine to patients since it had not been tested in a laboratory or approved by the government (p. 101), but few scientists of the time would have shared his ethical concerns. The New York City Health Department, for example, released a vaccine based on H. influenzae to hundreds of thousands of people in army camps and large companies (including 275,000 workers at U.S. Steel) after testing for reactions on a handful of laboratory employees (Eyler, 2009). Most 1918-1919 vaccine trial publications concluded that the vaccine studied was effective (Eyler, 2009). But effectiveness was typically judged from anecdotal evidence (as far as they knew, no one who had received the vaccine had developed influenza; see Figure 1 for examples). Multiple studies contrasted death rates in unvaccinated persons at the epidemic\u2019s peak with death rates in persons vaccinated during the waning days of the epidemic. But the vaccinated group had already survived the worst period of the outbreak and would have been more likely to have some natural immunity or be less susceptible to the disease. Often, vaccine effects could not be distinguished from effects of other interventions: Was the low flu incidence among students at a girls\u2019 school from the vaccine or from the quarantine imposed at the school? \u00b3 Figure 1. Examples of anecdotes about influenza vaccine effectiveness, from Value of Vaccination against Influenza (1918). In general, the 1918 studies with more rigorous designs were less likely to conclude that the vaccine studied was effective. McCoy et al. (1918), for example, attempted to equalize risk in the vaccine and no-vaccine groups: \u201cIn each ward of the hospital a list was made of all patients aged 41 or under, and each alternate patient was vaccinated, the remainder being considered as controls.\u201d They found no differences in influenza incidence or complications. Modern Vaccine Trials Dr. William Park wrote how the lack of a rigorous study design frustrated attempts to evaluate effectiveness of the New York City Health Department vaccine that had been offered at army bases and U.S. Steel: \u201cWe began the use of the influenza vaccine after the pandemic had already started, and some groups were not vaccinated until after the peak of the pandemic had been passed; so unless we have been able to get sufficient control cases, that is, presumably susceptible unvaccinated persons, exposed to the same degree , and observed at the same time as the vaccinated persons, we could arrive at no conclusion with regard to the efficiency of the vaccine. The reports from the use of the vaccine are being analyzed now, and it is already apparent that the majority of them are lacking in many essentials\u201d (Etiology of Influenza, 1918, p. 2097). McCoy (1919), reviewing shortcomings of the 1918 vaccine trials, reached a similar conclusion: \u201cThe only way in which we are to secure promptly acceptable evidence of the value of a bacterial vaccine is by the vaccination of only a portion of the individuals in a large group, holding the remainder as controls; age, sex, and conditions of exposure being the same in the two groups.\u201d Recognition of the shortcomings of anecdotal evidence during the 1918 epidemic led to intensive research on how to design a vaccine trial that would give reliable evidence. The influenza vaccine developed in 1942 was tested by assigning alternate persons in the list to vaccine and control groups; the 1954 polio vaccine trials randomly assigned children to vaccine and control groups. \u2074 My post \u201c Deming's Philosophy and Vaccine Development \u201d summarized Dr. Ivan Chan\u2019s 2021 Deming Lecture on the history of vaccine trial design research in the United States. Dr. Chan described how statisticians were able to build on decades of research to design clinical trials that were able to evaluate COVID vaccines\u2019 efficacy and safety within just a few months. Little (2025, p. 175), writing about milestones in statistics, highlighted the COVID vaccine trials as an example of sound statistical practice: \u201cWhy am I so sure that the [COVID] vaccines work? It is the product of remarkable science, but the empirical evidence comes from large [randomized controlled trials] \u2026 which establish beyond reasonable doubt that the vaccines are effective.\u201d Unfortunately, presentations and discussion at the September 19 , 2025 meeting of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) exhibited a return to the anecdotal evaluation methods of 1918. One ACIP panel member related her own anecdote during the discussion (minute 3:58.57 of the video ): \u201cFrom personal experience, my mother experienced a dermatologic immune response following a COVID booster in early 2022, and subsequently developed EGFR-positive lung cancer two years later.\u201d Anecdotal evidence was also featured prominently in presentations by panel members. For example, slide 14 of the presentation \u201c Workgroup safety uncertainties of mRNA COVID vaccines \u201d stated: \u201cCancers have been reported in mRNA vaccinated individuals in temporal association to immunization including (38 case reports and study of 96 cases of PDAC outcomes vs IgG4)\u201d [sic]. It sounds scary, but consider that more than 20 percent of people in the United States received a COVID booster in 2024-25, and about 2 million cancer diagnoses are made each year. The speaker did not define \u201ctemporal association\u201d but let\u2019s suppose this means that a cancer diagnosis was made during the month following vaccination. A rough back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that we would expect more than 33,000 people to be diagnosed with cancer in the month following vaccination, just by chance. \u2075 As Doctors McCoy and Park argued in 1919, it is not sufficient to identify a few occurrences of an outcome \u2014 whether that outcome is absence of influenza or a diagnosis of cancer \u2014 in people who have received a vaccine. You need to make a comparison with an equivalent control group. Neither the large randomized vaccine trials nor subsequent safety monitoring studies have found an increased risk of cancer after vaccination (Mayo Clinic, 2024; Iacobucci, 2025). Relying on cherry-picked anecdotes instead of statistically rigorous studies could be viewed as a way to make America healthy again \u2014 if the goal is to make Americans as healthy as they were during the 1918 influenza epidemic. Copyright (c) 2025 Sharon L. Lohr Footnotes and References \u00b9The CDC (2018) estimated that influenza and associated secondary infections killed 195,000 Americans in October 1918 alone and 675,000 altogether between 2018 and 2019, although all estimates have large error bars. In the novel, more than 100 Boynton residents are sickened and at least eight die during the fall of 1918. The This Week in Virology podcast with Taubenberger and Racaniello (2022) contains an entertaining and informative discussion on history and effects of the 1918 pandemic and on how the virus was sequenced from autopsy specimens and bodies buried in permafrost. \u00b2Some scientists suspected a viral cause but no one had yet identified the virus. For example, Freeman (1919, p. 919) hypothesized: \u201cInfluenza is caused by a specific living virus. This is based on analogy only and there is no experimental evidence confirming it.\u201d The American Public Health Association issued the statement: \u201cAssuming that the cause of the epidemic is an unknown virus, it does not seem possible at present to prevent the primary disease by vaccination with known organisms. Against the secondary infections there would seem to theoretical basis for the use of the vaccines\u201d (Wadsworth, 1919, pp. 310-311; see also Etiology of Influenza, 1918). \u00b3Publication bias also likely played a role, since doctors who found that their vaccines did not work would be less likely to publish their results. See Hand (2014, p. 136) for a general discussion of the effects of publication bias. \u2074Francis et al. (1945) described the design of the influenza vaccine trials. Second author Jonas Salk later developed the vaccine used in the polio trials. Randomization was employed in 84 areas in 11 states; other states did not use randomization (Meldrum, 1998). \u20752,000,000 x 0.2 x 1/12 = 33,333 people. But we would actually expect the number of cancer diagnoses in the month following vaccination to be higher than 33,000, since vaccination rates and cancer incidence are both highest in persons aged 65+. In addition, vaccination rates were higher in the early years of the pandemic so we would expect more cancer diagnoses soon after vaccination in those years. Casey, D. (2017).

Reading the book started me thinking about differences between clinical trials then and now. This post has spoilers for the epidemic, but none for the whodunit.</p><p class=\"\">Protagonist Alafair Tucker believes in her home remedies, but Casey injects a scientific perspective through the character of Dr. Emmett Carney, a researcher at the University of Oklahoma assigned to Boynton during its health emergency. Carney \u201chad been following the work of the virologists and bacteriologists Back East as they desperately tried to develop an effective treatment. He had had some success in reproducing their test results, and had even designed an experimental vaccine of his own\u201d (p. 61).</p><h3><strong>Influenza Vaccine Testing in 1918</strong></h3><p class=\"\">Dr. Carney could very plausibly have created a vaccine in 1918 \u2014 or, at least, what he thought was a vaccine. The 1918 influenza epidemic was the deadliest known in human history.<a href=\"https://www.sharonlohr.com/blog/2025/9/23/the-1918-influenza-pandemic-and-statistical-evidence#footnotes\">\u00b9</a> Many scientists of the time, seeing the ravages of the disease, were trying to develop vaccines. Influenza was not attributed to a viral cause until the 1930s, however,<a href=\"https://www.sharonlohr.com/blog/2025/9/23/the-1918-influenza-pandemic-and-statistical-evidence#footnotes\">\u00b2</a> and vaccine efforts in 1918 focused on bacteria such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilis influenzae </em>(then widely thought to cause influenza, hence its name).</p><p class=\"\">Dr. Carney did not offer his vaccine to patients since it had not been tested in a laboratory or approved by the government (p. 101), but few scientists of the time would have shared his ethical concerns. The New York City Health Department, for example, released a vaccine based on <em>H. influenzae</em> to hundreds of thousands of people in army camps and large companies (including 275,000 workers at U.S. Steel) after testing for reactions on a handful of laboratory employees (Eyler, 2009).</p><p class=\"\">Most 1918-1919 vaccine trial publications concluded that the vaccine studied was effective (Eyler, 2009). But effectiveness was typically judged from anecdotal evidence (as far as they knew, no one who had received the vaccine had developed influenza; see Figure 1 for examples). Multiple studies contrasted death rates in unvaccinated persons at the epidemic\u2019s peak with death rates in persons vaccinated during the waning days of the epidemic.

The whole idea of target trial emulation is clever and useful. The cleverness is as a communication tool: It helps avoid certain ambiguities by describing what researchers would have liked to do (and why), what was done, and the discrepancy between the two. This facilitates shared understanding and helps with critical appraisal. In that sense, target trial emulation was crying out for a reporting guideline. People who do target trials often testify that it clarifies their thinking about design (often the time zero stuff gets emphasised), and the Target statement in particular provides a structure that avoids missing certain blind-spots in reporting. As with most reporting guidelines, it is nominally about reporting, but sometimes \u2013 usefully, IMO \u2013 hints at what people should have done rather than how they report it. Personally, as someone whose bread-and-butter is randomised clinical trials, I find it helpful to understand what researchers would do if they could, deficiencies in the available data, and so on. I also like the emphasis on identifying assumptions. Despite the above praise, I will register two gripes. One is about what I see done; the other is about the Target statement itself. Gripe 1: Actual trials may not be target trials but describing a target trial does require good understanding of actual trials Target trial emulation is IMO particularly useful for communication with actual 3 trials people. The flip-side is that, to talk about a target trial, one must understand actual trials! In many descriptions of a \u201ctarget trial\u201d I see, there is huge ambiguity. I suspect this is because many people doing target trial emulation don\u2019t really know much about actual trials. One example is outcomes 4 . In actual trials, a lot of deliberation goes into outcome definition, measurement, review, and so on 5 . This seems to be treated fairly superficially in target trial emulation (see for example items 6e and 12 in the Target statement). In a sense this is understandable: you have what you have; different sites might be using different definitions; you might not really know the measurement protocol; etc. But of course, actual trials have these in-depth discussions because it matters, so highlighting discrepancies is important. It\u2019s exactly like the \u201ctime zero\u201d thing, but for some reason does not receive much emphasis. Gripe 2: Target statement leaves causal estimands translucent-to-opaque Defining a target trial helps to know what people would like to do. It\u2019s procedural. Some of its advocates claim that knowing this tells us exactly what people want to learn (the estimand). Nope. An estimand is a natural-language description of the effect we wish to learn about. For methodological work, this is often compressed into the mathematical notation of potential outcomes because it\u2019s useful for identification purposes (imagine writing out words every time instead of Y \u00b9 or Y (1)  whatever you write). Once we have a study design, we can work towards finding an identifying expression in terms of observable quantities (some people call this the \u201cstatistical estimand\u201d, which is [i] reasonable and [ii] confusing; net-bad). I think the idea in target trials is that the identifying expression should be trivially simple, like a simple comparison of means or whatever. That\u2019s fine, but trivially-simple identification still does not tell us what causal estimand is identifies. Something statisticians used to do all the time in actual trials \u2013 no doubt some still do \u2013 was to censor data after an intercurrent event, then analyse the ITT set (e.g. a Cox model for censored time-to-event outcomes, or a mixed model for quantitative outcomes). Amazingly, this was sometimes accompanied by a statement that the trial tests the effects of randomisation (implying treatment policy). This was not right; those censoring and estimation procedures targeted what we would now term a hypothetical strategy. The point is, there is often a discrepancy between what people claim they want (the estimand) and what they actually do (analysis approach). Saying what they want does not resolve the discrepancy, but without it we would not even know that there is one. They might think they are estimating one thing, you might assume something else. The point is, describing your target trial is great, but even that does not tell us the estimand. Also, given Hern\u00e1n\u2019s semantic quibbles (mostly wrong) about E9(R1) Addendum-style estimands 6 at EFSPI workshop , I\u2019m going to hit back and highlight a paragraph I\u2019ve been referred to several times in the past 7 , held up each time as the way to precisely define a \u201ccausal contrast\u201d. Read what you will into this picture of my boy a few years ago (noticing where the arrow is, and the boar). Disclaimer The above are observations from listening to quite a lot of presentations about target trial emulation, but I\u2019m certainly no expert. I want to re-emphasise that it can be a great communication tool and I will often jump to defend it. Just because something is frequently misunderstood or misused does not make it an inherently a bad idea (see also: Statistics ).

I like to express the first two in terms of a \"return on effort\" metric. See this post . It's not that every graphic that requires a long time to process is bad; the issue is when we expend the effort but don't receive the reward. The last metric (\"influence\") is a very high bar. It's something we dream of, but rarely achieve. Worse, it may be easier to attain influence by deception using flawed graphics. Avinash then analyzes four infographics that each explain Covid risks to illustrate his scoring mechanism. (The post was originally published during the Covid era.) Since I included xkcd 's cartoon up top, let's take a closer look. Like Avinash, I'm treating it as a data visualization, which was not the intention \u2013 so be warned. We are looking at a grid. Based on the color scheme, it's a 4x4 grid. There's something of a scatter plot living on this grid. Think of each \"dot\" in the scatter plot as a text box. Each text box contains an activity. Each activity is rated on two dimensions: Covid risk, and non-Covid risk. These axis labels are concise but imprecise. \"Covid risk\" really means the risk of catching Covid while doing said activity while \"non Covid risk\" signifies the general risk(s) of said activity other than catching Covid. For example, \"staying home\" has negligible risk of catching Covid (assuming there isn't an infected family member), and \"staying home\" presents low risks in general to someone, even if we ignore Covid risk (top left corner). By contrast, \"singing in the church\" is not typically regarded as a risky activity, but during Covid, it was a super-spreader event (top right corner). This leads us to one avenue to consume this infographic. The diagonal going from top left to bottom right represents status quo: activities that didn't change in risk profile due to Covid. Our attention should be drawn to the top right corner, where those activities have elevated risks of catching Covid, relative to doing them prior to the pandemic. As a matter of curiosity, the activities shown in the bottom left corner are ironically less risky during Covid than prior. Top right corner: singing in church, going to a restaurant, going to a bar, going to a party, attending in-person classes, etc. are usually considered dangerous but during Covid, that was how people got infected. Bottom left corner: bungee jumping while doing sword tricks, going down a waterslide on an electric scooter, running and sliding headfirst into the pins at a bowling alley, etc. For these activities, the risk during Covid was rated lower than prior, probably because many of these recreational centers were closed, and they don't involve crowds of people. xkcd actually makes a subtle point that isn't conveyed in the other infographics: that the risk profiles of some activities changed dramatically during a pandemic. I can't figure out the color scheme of the graphic. The green, yellow, orange, and red colors correspond to the distance from the top left corner (\"origin\"), which represents low Covid risk and low non-Covid risk. Take the red boxes. They show activities that have either high risk of catching Covid or high non-Covid risk (or both). The latter segment includes some activities with low Covid risk. It's confusing. Though I said above the form of the plot is that of a scatter plot , I really should make a clarification. For the notion of a \"scatter\" or \"cluster\" does not exist. What xkcd did is to fill the entire grid with evenly spaced data. The data are made up to represent all points in the grid; the density of the data does not vary, and as such, they do not contain any statistical meaning, unlike the usual scatter plots.",

Over on his website historian Bret Devereaux has started a series on debates about early Greek warfare. The first post in that series is well worth reading . It puts me in a dilemma because I see some things differently than he does, but I can\u2019t spare the time for such a lengthy and carefully footnoted essay. So I will respond with four theses about those academic controversies, using vivid bloggy writing and linking to my earlier posts and academic publications. I will follow his lead by avoiding discussion of Victor Davis Hanson\u2019s political project although I had to address it in my review of The Other Greeks . Hanson\u2019s ideas about early Greek warfare were not original in 1989. His great achievement was expressing them in clear and contemporary language which spread outside the lecture hall and the seminar room. First, I agree with Devereaux that there were two debates: one about what happened on ancient Greek battlefields, and the other whether Greek warfare was basically the same everywhere from 750 to 432 BCE, or varied across time and space. These two debates are not inherently connected and many people have put forward theories about combat mechanics without claiming that these theories have some profound implications for ancient cultures. Roel Konijnendijk ignored the debate about massed shoves or metaphorical pushes in his monograph on early Greek warfare without that affecting his argument. Many scholars argued against a massed push by whole lines of hoplites without arguing that Greek warfare varied from place to place and time to time. Second, I think that the debate about hoplite battles is undecided, while the debate about revolution or gradual change ended in a decisive victory by the Krentz-van Wees school (the former heretics). Neither the California School (Victor Davis Hanson and sympathizers) with their ideas about rugby scrums, nor the Krentz-van Wees school with their ideas about loose crowds of soldiers, had ideas about how battles worked which convince most thoughtful observers. This is understandable since none of them had much experience in combat sports and none sought out people with that experience before forming their basic views. Third, in many ways, the intense scholarly debate about combat mechanics, and emotional language like \u201corthodoxy\u201d and \u201cheretics,\u201d disguised how much the parties agreed about. The debate about ancient Greek warfare from 1989 to 2013 was a classical philologist\u2019s game (and incidentally an American and British man\u2019s game ). Victor Davis Hanson made an argument based on texts describing southern mainland Greece, supplemented with a casual use of archaeology and art from the wider Greek world, and critics responded with more rigorous arguments about the same type of evidence. They didn\u2019t have to learn about Egyptian paintings or the Stele of the Vultures or weapons in Italian tombs. Even an adventurous scholar like Hans van Wees leaned heavily on a single comparison (with war in Highland New Guinea before the gun) and that was one of the most controversial aspects of his theories. The two sides were in agreement about how to fight, like Georgian duelists counting out their paces in some foggy field. Fourth, the debate drastically shifted in 2013. On one hand, van Wees\u2019 former student Josho Brouwers published a book on early Greek warfare which centered archaeology and put Greece in its broader cultural context. Archaic Greece was not much like Pericles\u2019 Athens, proud of its separation from and superiority to barbarians, and more like the Norse world of the Viking Age, eagerly learning from, mixing with, and robbing Slavs, Persians, Romans, Franks, and Irish. Many cultures in the eastern Mediterranean had lines of spearmen with bronze helmets and large shields, and the ancients said that many nations had hoplites or men \u201carmed like Greeks.\u201d 1 Trying to decide whether the hoplites on the Amathus bowl are Greeks, Carians, or Phoenicians is fruitless. On the other hand, hoplite reenactment began to grow more organized and scientific , and the spread of high-speed Internet made it easier to share videos. Since about 2013, it has become more common to try out theories about moving troops, pushing with shields, or fighting in lines. These trials cannot replace traditional scholarship: nobody dies in them and they are not always carried out or written up with academic strictness. However, we can now say that it is indeed possible for whole lines of men with shields to push on each other without suffocating because we tried it; just like we can refute the myth of the heavily burdened hoplite because we looked at ancient artifacts and they were small and light. Its easier to agree on the weight of helmet than on how to interpret the Iliad . Since about 2013, new empirical evidence has started to flow into debates about early Greek warfare, and archaeologists and specialists in Italy or Anatolia have published lively work which goes farther than Krentz or van Wees dared to. The debate since 2013 has not been stalled just because a few people still hold to the old California School or because nobody can agree about just what happened when two lines of spearmen came together. Some of these theses might be controversial, especially the fourth. Its unfortunate that nobody in Josho Browers\u2019 circle ended up in a stable research job, but not surprising at a time when institutions that study the ancient world are being demolished. While I am not shy about criticizing approaches to the ancient world which I disagree with, we all have a common interest in keeping people teaching and studying antiquity. While it can feel tedious to keep writing about Greek hoplites, its also exciting that people without academic training are interested in what we have to say. Good scholarship takes time!

However, we can now say that it is indeed possible for whole lines of men with shields to push on each other without suffocating because we tried it; just like we can refute <a href=\"https://www.bookandsword.com/2019/06/15/the-myth-of-the-heavily-burdened-hoplite/\">the myth of the heavily burdened hoplite</a> because we looked at ancient artifacts and they were small and light. Its easier to agree on the weight of helmet than on how to interpret the <em>Iliad</em>. Since about 2013, new empirical evidence has started to flow into debates about early Greek warfare, and archaeologists and specialists in Italy or Anatolia have published lively work which goes farther than Krentz or van Wees dared to. The debate since 2013 has not been stalled just because a few people still hold to the old California School or because nobody can agree about just what happened when two lines of spearmen came together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these theses might be controversial, especially the fourth. Its unfortunate that nobody in Josho Browers&#8217; circle ended up in a stable research job, but not surprising at a time when institutions that study the ancient world are being demolished. While I am not shy about criticizing approaches to the ancient world which I disagree with, we all have a common interest in keeping people teaching and studying antiquity. While it can feel tedious to keep writing about Greek hoplites, its also exciting that people without academic training are interested in what we have to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Good scholarship takes time!

The LLM changes the benefit term (richer interpretations, smoother CX), increases the failure probabilities $p_i$ (and adds failure modes that didn't exist before), and increases the cost of controls (validation layers, fallbacks, monitoring). To see why the $\\Delta p_i$ show up\u2014and why they often dominate\u2014it helps to treat a workflow as a finite-state machine. A deterministic workflow can be modeled as a Mealy machine. $$ M = (S, \\Sigma, \\Lambda, \\delta, \\lambda, s_0) $$ where $S$ captures states or progress, e.g., Awaiting Evidence , Approved , Committed , inputs $\\Sigma$ are events the system accepts, e.g., claim_received , payment_confirmed , and outputs $\\Lambda$ are the system\u2019s actions, e.g., issue_refund , send_notice. The transition function $\\delta$ determines the next state, and the output function $\\lambda$ selects the action emitted on each transition. $s_0$ is the initial state. Commit edges are transitions with irreversible real-world effects. When we introduce a large language model into a deterministic workflow, we fundamentally change the nature of the system. The FSM, which was previously predictable and verifiable at every step, now contains stochastic components. Let me illustrate the potential set of  issues with three kinds of failures: Input . Traditional workflows receive structured inputs with clear semantics, e.g., selection of claim_reason from a fixed set using a dropdown menu. With natural language inputs, the model must map text $x$ to a symbol $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma$. Consider a customer saying \"my package arrived late and damaged.\" The model must map this to the appropriate system symbols\u2014perhaps claim_damaged , claim_late , and item=A . But natural language is inherently ambiguous. Does \"late\" mean past the promised delivery date or later than the customer expected? Does \"damaged\" refer to claim_damaged (70% confidence) or claim_defective (30%)? If the LLM maps \"used\" to claim_defective instead of claim_damaged , the entire workflow routes to technical support instead of replacements. Worse, adversarial users may exploit this ambiguity. Control Flow . Deterministic routing is a crisp function $(s,\\sigma) \\mapsto s'$. Given a state and input, there's exactly one next state. When an LLM controls routing, it becomes probabilistic. From the same $(s,\\sigma)$, execution can diverge based on how the model interprets context and intent. And the model may route in a way that violates your system's assumptions. For instance, an LLM may receive a damage claim and simultaneously route it to the replacement team, quality assurance, and executive escalation because it \"sensed urgency\" in the customer's tone. It might retry failed operations repeatedly with minor variations. Output . The FSM's output function $\\lambda(s, \\sigma)$ produces a symbol from the output alphabet\u2014perhaps refund_approved or claim_denied . But the LLM must verbalize this in natural language. When verbalizing, it can introduce promises the system never made or reveal information it shouldn't. An LLM told to \"send a refund confirmation\" might compose an email promising the refund will arrive tomorrow (when processing takes 3-5 days), include a 20% discount code (unauthorized), and apologize on behalf of the CEO (inappropriate). Anti-Patterns These points lead to two common anti-patterns. First, LLM guardrails. We take guardrails to mean something that prevents bad things from happening. But LLM guardrails are probabilistic and depend on distributional assumptions. Second, schema validation. Getting output in the right format is not the same as getting the right information. Making LLMs Less Risky in an FSM The goal is not to make the LLM deterministic\u2014that is impossible\u2014but to manage its impact. Effective patterns include: Keep stochastic components off commit edges . Use two-phase commit with some verification step using HITL for expensive actions like issuing the refund. Don't use LLMs where you don't need to . For instance, LLM may invent new reasons or promises when explaining a decision. Instead, render reasons from the decision artifact (facts, rules fired) using a template: $\\lambda'(s, \\sigma) = \\text{Template}(\\text{facts}, \\text{rules})$. Blast radius constraints . Spending Limits. Add constraints like $\\phi$ (e.g., \"total refunded \u2264 total paid\") with a runtime checker. If $\\phi$ would be violated, block the transition regardless of what the agent proposes. Monitoring, Rollback, Release Measure money. Measure refund leakage, inappropriate denials, out-of-policy approvals, avoidable escalations, etc. Kill-switches and selective disablement. You need the ability to turn off specific model behaviors without shutting down the entire system. That means you can disable a tool call, remove a branch, bypass the model on certain states, or route an entire class of cases to deterministic logic or HITL. Controlled, intelligent release. LLM-driven components should never go from zero to 100%. Release changes gradually: start with low-stakes states, narrow slices of traffic, or non-financial actions. Expand only after observing the dollar impact and analyzing data. Task Granularity: The Goldilocks Problem Breaking a workflow into LLM tasks involves a fundamental tradeoff. Large tasks cause reasoning failures. Small tasks cause orchestration failures. There's an optimal middle ground\u2014but finding it is more subtle than it first appears. For total work $L$ divided into steps of size $s$, we get $n = L/s$ steps. The simplest model assumes per-step error has two components: $$ e(s) = c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_0, \\quad \\alpha > 1 $$ Where: $c \\cdot s^{\\alpha}$: complexity-driven error that grows superlinearly with task size $\\varepsilon_0$: fixed overhead error per step (parsing, tool calls, handoffs) Total error across the workflow: $$ \\text{Total Error} = \\frac{L}{s} \\cdot (c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_0) = L \\left( c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s} \\right) $$ To minimize total error, we differentiate with respect to $s$ and set to zero: $$ \\frac{d}{ds}\\left[ c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s} \\right] = c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha - 2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s^2} = 0 $$ Solving yields: $$ s_{\\text{simple}}^* = \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{c(\\alpha - 1)} \\right)^{1/\\alpha} $$ The formula suggests: Better models (lower $c$) \u2192 larger optimal steps Better tooling (lower $\\varepsilon_0$) \u2192 smaller optimal steps viable The simple model assumes overhead $\\varepsilon_0$ is fixed regardless of what's being passed between steps. But error could be multiplicative with loss in context proving damaging. A more accurate model accounts for context-dependent overhead: $$ e(s) = c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta}, \\quad 0 < \\beta < 1 $$ Where: $\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}$: truly fixed overhead (API calls, parsing) $\\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta}$: context serialization overhead that grows with complexity The choice $\\beta < 1$ reflects that context overhead grows slower than reasoning complexity\u2014passing complex context is hard, but not as hard as reasoning about it. Total error becomes: $$ \\text{Total Error} = L \\left( c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}}{s} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta - 1} \\right) $$ Taking the derivative and setting to zero: $$ c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha - 2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}}{s^2} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta - 2} = 0 $$ Multiplying by $s^2$ gives the optimality condition: $$ \\boxed{c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}} $$ Since $\\beta < 1$, the term $\\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta}$ is negative. This means at the simple model's optimum $s_{\\text{simple}}^*$, the left side is less than $\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}$. Therefore: $$ s^* > s_{\\text{simple}}^* $$ Context overhead pushes the optimal step size larger than the simple model suggests. Unlike the simple model, we must solve the optimality condition numerically and must calibrate. Other Operational Realities Models drift and change. Temperature $0$ is not a proof of determinism; vendor updates can shift behavior. Track versioned prompts and models; use canaries and rollback. Errors hide in plain sight. Long stretches of apparent success conceal catastrophic outliers. Track $\\sum_i p_i L_i$ and tail metrics (e.g., $\\text{CVaR}_\\alpha$) at the business level. Adversaries adapt. People learn \"magic phrases\" that bypass heuristics or trigger generous interpretations. Assume red\u2011teaming is continuous. The integration tax is real. Monitoring, fallbacks, rate limits, and escape hatches add complexity. Budget for it explicitly. Engineering with Uncertainty Moving to LLMs shifts the entire validation strategy. Deterministic components can be proven safe with unit tests: given the same state and input, they behave the same way every time. LLMs don\u2019t offer that. They inject variance, and variance doesn\u2019t break in predictable places. So correctness becomes a matter of risk budgeting rather than test coverage. Keep the model away from high-impact actions, let deterministic checks own the final say on anything expensive, and monitor behavior as if it were a live system rather than a piece of code. In the end, what matters is not how often the model parses JSON correctly but how much value leaks through policy violations, how much friction customers experience, and whether the workflow stays inside the tolerances the business can afford.",

Traditional workflows receive structured inputs with clear semantics, e.g., selection of <code>claim_reason</code> from a fixed set using a dropdown menu. With natural language inputs, the model must map text $x$ to a symbol $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma$. Consider a customer saying &quot;my package arrived late and damaged.&quot; The model must map this to the appropriate system symbols&#x2014;perhaps <code>claim_damaged</code>, <code>claim_late</code>, and <code>item=A</code>. But natural language is inherently ambiguous. Does &quot;late&quot; mean past the promised delivery date or later than the customer expected? Does &quot;damaged&quot; refer to <code>claim_damaged</code> (70% confidence) or <code>claim_defective</code> (30%)? If the LLM maps &quot;used&quot; to <code>claim_defective</code> instead of <code>claim_damaged</code>, the entire workflow routes to technical support instead of replacements. Worse, adversarial users may exploit this ambiguity.</li><li><strong>Control Flow</strong>. Deterministic routing is a crisp function $(s,\\sigma) \\mapsto s&apos;$. Given a state and input, there&apos;s exactly one next state. When an LLM controls routing, it becomes probabilistic. From the same $(s,\\sigma)$, execution can diverge based on how the model interprets context and intent. And the model may route in a way that violates your system&apos;s assumptions. For instance, an LLM may receive a damage claim and simultaneously route it to the replacement team, quality assurance, and executive escalation because it &quot;sensed urgency&quot; in the customer&apos;s tone. It might retry failed operations repeatedly with minor variations. </li><li><strong>Output</strong>. The FSM&apos;s output function $\\lambda(s, \\sigma)$ produces a symbol from the output alphabet&#x2014;perhaps <code>refund_approved</code> or <code>claim_denied</code>. But the LLM must verbalize this in natural language. When verbalizing, it can introduce promises the system never made or reveal information it shouldn&apos;t. An LLM told to &quot;send a refund confirmation&quot; might compose an email promising the refund will arrive tomorrow (when processing takes 3-5 days), include a 20% discount code (unauthorized), and apologize on behalf of the CEO (inappropriate). </li></ol><h3 id=\"anti-patterns\">Anti-Patterns</h3><p>These points lead to two common anti-patterns. First, LLM guardrails. We take guardrails to mean something that prevents bad things from happening. But LLM guardrails are probabilistic and depend on distributional assumptions. Second, schema validation. Getting output in the right format is not the same as getting the right information.</p><h3 id=\"making-llms-less-risky-in-an-fsm\">Making LLMs Less Risky in an FSM</h3><p>The goal is not to make the LLM deterministic&#x2014;that is impossible&#x2014;but to manage its impact. Effective patterns include:</p><ol><li><strong>Keep stochastic components off commit edges</strong>. Use two-phase commit with some verification step using HITL for expensive actions like issuing the refund.</li><li><strong>Don&apos;t use LLMs where you don&apos;t need to</strong>. For instance, LLM may invent new reasons or promises when explaining a decision. Instead, render reasons from the decision artifact (facts, rules fired) using a template: $\\lambda&apos;(s, \\sigma) = \\text{Template}(\\text{facts}, \\text{rules})$.</li><li><strong>Blast radius constraints</strong>. <ol><li><strong>Spending Limits. </strong>Add constraints like $\\phi$ (e.g., &quot;total refunded &#x2264; total paid&quot;) with a runtime checker. If $\\phi$ would be violated, block the transition regardless of what the agent proposes. </li><li><strong>Monitoring, Rollback, Release</strong><ol><li><strong>Measure money.</strong> Measure refund leakage, inappropriate denials, out-of-policy approvals, avoidable escalations, etc. </li><li><strong>Kill-switches and selective disablement.</strong> You need the ability to turn off <em>specific</em> model behaviors without shutting down the entire system. That means you can disable a tool call, remove a branch, bypass the model on certain states, or route an entire class of cases to deterministic logic or HITL. </li><li><strong>Controlled, intelligent release.</strong> LLM-driven components should never go from zero to 100%. Release changes gradually: start with low-stakes states, narrow slices of traffic, or non-financial actions. Expand only after observing the dollar impact and analyzing data. </li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><h3 id=\"task-granularity-the-goldilocks-problem\">Task Granularity: The Goldilocks Problem</h3><p>Breaking a workflow into LLM tasks involves a fundamental tradeoff. Large tasks cause reasoning failures. Small tasks cause orchestration failures. There&apos;s an optimal middle ground&#x2014;but finding it is more subtle than it first appears.</p><p>For total work $L$ divided into steps of size $s$, we get $n = L/s$ steps. The simplest model assumes per-step error has two components:</p><p>$$ e(s) = c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_0, \\quad \\alpha &gt; 1 $$</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li>$c \\cdot s^{\\alpha}$: complexity-driven error that grows superlinearly with task size</li><li>$\\varepsilon_0$: fixed overhead error per step (parsing, tool calls, handoffs)</li></ul><p>Total error across the workflow:</p><p>$$ \\text{Total Error} = \\frac{L}{s} \\cdot (c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_0) = L \\left( c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s} \\right) $$</p><p>To minimize total error, we differentiate with respect to $s$ and set to zero:</p><p>$$ \\frac{d}{ds}\\left[ c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s} \\right] = c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha - 2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s^2} = 0 $$</p><p>Solving yields:</p><p>$$ s_{\\text{simple}}^* = \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{c(\\alpha - 1)} \\right)^{1/\\alpha} $$</p><p>The formula suggests:</p><ul><li>Better models (lower $c$) &#x2192; larger optimal steps</li><li>Better tooling (lower $\\varepsilon_0$) &#x2192; smaller optimal steps viable</li></ul><p>The simple model assumes overhead $\\varepsilon_0$ is fixed regardless of what&apos;s being passed between steps. But error could be multiplicative with loss in context proving damaging. A more accurate model accounts for context-dependent overhead:</p><p>$$ e(s) = c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta}, \\quad 0 &lt; \\beta &lt; 1 $$</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li>$\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}$: truly fixed overhead (API calls, parsing)</li><li>$\\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta}$: context serialization overhead that grows with complexity</li></ul><p>The choice $\\beta &lt; 1$ reflects that context overhead grows slower than reasoning complexity&#x2014;passing complex context is hard, but not as hard as reasoning about it.</p><p>Total error becomes:</p><p>$$ \\text{Total Error} = L \\left( c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}}{s} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta - 1} \\right) $$</p><p>Taking the derivative and setting to zero:</p><p>$$ c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha - 2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}}{s^2} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta - 2} = 0 $$</p><p>Multiplying by $s^2$ gives the optimality condition:</p><p>$$ \\boxed{c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}} $$</p><p>Since $\\beta &lt; 1$, the term $\\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta}$ is negative. This means at the simple model&apos;s optimum $s_{\\text{simple}}^*$, the left side is less than $\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}$. Therefore:</p><p>$$ s^* &gt; s_{\\text{simple}}^* $$</p><p>Context overhead pushes the optimal step size larger than the simple model suggests. Unlike the simple model, we must solve the optimality condition numerically and must calibrate.</p><h3 id=\"other-operational-realities\">Other Operational Realities</h3><ul><li><strong>Models drift and change.</strong> Temperature $0$ is not a proof of determinism; vendor updates can shift behavior. Track versioned prompts and models; use canaries and rollback.</li><li><strong>Errors hide in plain sight.</strong> Long stretches of apparent success conceal catastrophic outliers. Track $\\sum_i p_i L_i$ and tail metrics (e.g., $\\text{CVaR}_\\alpha$) at the business level.</li><li><strong>Adversaries adapt.</strong> People learn &quot;magic phrases&quot; that bypass heuristics or trigger generous interpretations. Assume red&#x2011;teaming is continuous.</li><li><strong>The integration tax is real.</strong> Monitoring, fallbacks, rate limits, and escape hatches add complexity. Budget for it explicitly.</li></ul><h3 id=\"engineering-with-uncertainty\">Engineering with Uncertainty</h3><p>Moving to LLMs shifts the entire validation strategy. Deterministic components can be proven safe with unit tests: given the same state and input, they behave the same way every time. LLMs don&#x2019;t offer that. They inject variance, and variance doesn&#x2019;t break in predictable places. So correctness becomes a matter of risk budgeting rather than test coverage. Keep the model away from high-impact actions, let deterministic checks own the final say on anything expensive, and monitor behavior as if it were a live system rather than a piece of code. In the end, what matters is not how often the model parses JSON correctly but how much value leaks through policy violations, how much friction customers experience, and whether the workflow stays inside the tolerances the business can afford.</p>"

        "full_content": "Consider the following set of trades executed in quick succession on Polymarket at around 6pm on November 1, just a couple of days before polls opened on election day: This is just a small sample of a string of very similar transactions executed by the same trader at around the same time. At first glance they appear to make no sense\u2014each purchase is followed quickly by a sale at a price that is a tenth of a penny lower, resulting in a guaranteed loss. It appears that the trader is willing to incur relatively modest losses in order to boost recorded volume by a substantial amount. But is the trader actually incurring losses? That would depend on the counterparties to these trades. If all wallets involved were engaged in a collusive exercise to boost volume, losses for some would correspond to gains for others, netting out to zero for the group as a whole. This would be an example of wash trading , defined as the practice of entering into \u201ctransactions to give the appearance that purchases and sales have been made, without incurring market risk or changing the trader\u2019s market position.\u201d Such activity is prohibited by law on regulated exchanges in the United States, and can be subject to significant sanctions . But how can one reliably detect collusive clusters of accounts that are engaged in wash trading? To see the difficulty, suppose one were to discover that each of the trades shown above had the same counterparty. This alone would not be decisive, because market makers often place orders to buy and sell the same security, hoping to profit from the spread. Such activity is both lawful and routine. If some trader is intent on filling the posted orders at a loss, a market maker will gladly accommodate them for a profit. So checking to see if the counterparties to a suspected wash trader happen to all be the same is not enough\u2014they could all be the same market maker. What one needs to do is to look at counterparties to those counterparties across all their other transactions. Like wash traders, market makers open and close positions rapidly, and avoid building up large positions that would expose them to substantial risk. 1 But there is one major difference between them. Wash traders trade with other wash traders in their collusive clique, while market makers neither know nor care who their counterparties are. In fact, market makers seldom trade with other market makers. 2 That is, if one were to represent traders as nodes and transactions between them as edges in a network, wash traders would exhibit homophily while market makers exhibit heterophily . This is the central idea explored in a paper that was posted online last week, on which I am a co-author. The lead author is Allen Sirolly, an exceptional doctoral student, and other co-authors are Hongyao Ma and Yash Kanoria. There has been a fair amount of media coverage and online commentary on the paper, but this has focused largely on its empirical claims rather than on the core theoretical contribution. Our primary goal in writing the paper was to introduce a novel method for the detection of wash trades that could identify not just the obvious cases visible to a casual observer, but also more sophisticated schemes that might otherwise escape scrutiny. The proposed algorithm is modular, with an initialization stage followed by an iterative network-based redistribution stage. At initialization, we assign to each wallet a score based on its propensity to open and close positions repeatedly. At the redistribution stage, we update each wallet\u2019s score based on the scores of its volume-weighted counterparties. This is done repeatedly until we achieve approximate convergence. Those wallets left with scores above a specified model parameter are then identified as wash traders. The process is parameter-dependent but robust to changes in parameters. You can see the process at work in the following figure, which appears as Figure 5 in the paper. Each node corresponds to a wallet, with area proportional to the square root of share volume. Many wallets with high scores at the initialization stage (shown in red) are dropped at successive iterations at the redistribution stage, leaving wash traders identified with high confidence after three iterations. The three wallets flagged at the bottom left all have similar names: MAY20, MAY175, and MAY176. These are part of a cluster of 200 with names all starting with MAY, trading almost exclusively with each other. These wallets collectively traded over 116 million shares and generated more than 113 million in dollar volume, but ended up with an aggregate loss of just $57.86. One of these was MAY117 , an account that bought and sold over a million shares across 33 markets over several months and ended up with profits of precisely zero. 3 The modular nature of the algorithm allows for choosing different criteria at the initialization stage (such as the number of transactions per unit time) and then using the redistribution stage to identify accounts that trade almost exclusively with others exhibiting similar behavior. The approach can be easily applied to other markets for which transaction-level data are available, and it could be useful to exchanges interested in rooting out wash trading. 4 Any algorithm of this kind, once published and implemented, is likely to result in strategic responses by wash traders that better allow them to evade detection. Ideally one would want to design a system that is not vulnerable to such gaming, but whether or not this ideal is even attainable remains an open question. We consider the simplicity and interpretability of our algorithm to be a strength, but understand that ours is not the last word. There are other ways to approach the problem, and the problem itself is important. Trading volume is among the most commonly used measures of market participation and conviction, and wash trading makes it imprecise and less meaningful. Developing a transparent and modular detection algorithm\u2014rather than the specific empirical claims about a particular exchange\u2014is the enduring contribution of the research. 1 The risk comes from adverse selection\u2014significant new information could arrive while orders on both sides of the market are resting in the order book, in which case the orders that get snapped up by other traders are precisely those that would inflict losses on the market maker. The general problem of market maker pricing in the face of adverse selection has been studied in classic papers by Glosten and Milgrom and Kyle . 2 Each trade in a continuous double auction involves a liquidity provider and a liquidity taker, so while liquidity providers compete with each other in the placement of bids and offers, they seldom transact with each other. 3 See Figure 1 in the paper for more information on this cluster. Allen has posted a useful thread with additional details and examples. 4 In this regard, the initial reaction from at least one Polymarket insider has been encouraging.",

Headline poll findings: Our new November Strength in Numbers /Verasight poll finds Democrats leading the 2026 U.S. House generic ballot, 47% to 42% for Republicans. In a survey experiment, when respondents are told Republicans currently control the House and Senate, preference for Democrats rises to 48% vs 41% for Republicans\u00a0\u2014 an expanded margin of D+7. In our first poll conducted after the 2025 elections, and while the U.S. Congress was in the process of ending the government shutdown, President Donald Trump received a job approval rating of 41% approve to 57% disapprove (\u201316). The president is deeply negative on prices/inflation (\u201333) and health care (\u201326). A broad majority of 65% of voters said they do not think Trump has kept his promises on the economy, while 24% say he has. Additionally, 58% of adults say they want government food assistance via SNAP to be fully funded during government shutdowns. Blame for the shutdown is split: 36% say Trump deserves the most blame, 35% say Democrats do, and 19% say Republicans in Congress bear the most blame. When we split our sample based on when respondents completed interviews, Trump\u2019s job approval ticked up slightly after the shutdown deal was reached. On the topic of health care, 59% of adults oppose the expiration of ACA marketplace subsidies this year. To continue to fund such programs, a broad majority of 63% of the public supports raising taxes on corporations and households making $400,000 per year. Finally, voters are deeply dissatisfied with their choices of political leaders and parties. Majorities of American adults say each political party is out of touch with the needs of the average person. Fifty-four and 55 percent of voters say the Democrats and Republicans, respectively, are not in touch. Additionally, 61% of adults say they don\u2019t feel represented by the two major parties. But what can the crosstabs tell us about why the Democratic and Republican brands are in such trouble? Share Subscribe now Methodology note: Verasight conducted this poll among 2,038 U.S. adult residents from November 12-14, 2025. It has a margin of sampling error of 2.3%. The survey was weighted to match the political and demographic characteristics of the U.S. adult population according to the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as recent benchmarks for partisanship and past vote from official election results and the Pew Research Center. Verasight uses mail, SMS text, and the internet to recruit a sample using hybrid sampling (both probability-based and non-probability techniques). To ensure independence of the research and editorial processes, Verasight handled recruitment, interviewing, and weighting the survey. Strength In Numbers conducts all analysis and editorial processes. SIN had input on questions, but did not participate in other methodological decisions. You can download a PDF of the poll results, question wording, and a full methodology statement at the bottom of this page. Generic ballot In our first survey after Democrats swept major elections this November , the party holds a 5 point lead, 47% to 42%, over the Republicans in the race for the U.S. House in next year\u2019s midterms. The 5-point margin is similar to the party\u2019s average 6-point margin in our surveys going back to May 2025: This month, we split our sample in half and asked 1,019 U.S. adults a different version of the generic ballot question that specified who currently controls Congress. In this \u201cinformed ballot\u201d question, Democrats slightly widen their lead in the race for the House vote next year by 2 points. Similar to a  recent experiment by YouGov Blue, detailed in this newsletter at The Downballot , we find that the effect is mostly driven by independents moving against the Republican Party. In our usual question, independents currently break 36% to 25% for the Democrats over Republicans (D+11), with 39% saying they are undecided for next year\u2019s house elections. In the informed ballot, the Democratic vote share rises to 44%, Republican share rises to 28% (D+16), and undecided percent shrinks to 29%. Among registered voters, Democrats have an identical 5-point lead on the usual generic ballot question, 49% to 44%. Share Trump job and issue approval In our November data, 41% of Americans approve of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president, while 57% disapprove. The net rating of -16 is the lowest we have measured since our first poll in May, 2025. One important difference since that survey, however, is the rising percentage of Americans who say they \u201cstrongly disapprove\u201d of Trump\u2019s job as president \u2014 which has risen from 42% to 46% over the last six months. Our last survey in October had Trump at -15 overall on net, 56% to 41%. In our November poll, an all-time high of 64% of adults say they disapprove of the job Donald Trump is doing on prices and inflation \u2014 a key issue in this month\u2019s elections that saw Democrats sweep statewide races in Virginia, New Jersey, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. A majority of Americans disapprove of how the president is handling every major issue we polled, with the exceptions of crime and border security \u2014 the latter of which is the only issue Trump has a net positive rating on. The president\u2019s previous low rating on prices was -32. In our new November poll, a majority of voters say they disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue. President Trump has also lost ground on most issues related to the economy and government spending. And he has flatlined on deportations and immigration, on which he scores a -8 and -4, respectively \u2014 issues previously trending in his direction: The only bright spot for Trump is how the public feels about his handling of trade with other countries \u2014 likely due to his capitulation on most trade disputes with other countries, and the news of a pending potential clawing back of the president\u2019s emergency powers by the Supreme Court . In our October poll, 55% of adults said they disapproved of the president\u2019s tariffs. Share Both party brands are underwater \u2014 but for different reasons Recent polls have shown that majorities of voters say the Democratic and Republican parties are \u201cout of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today.\u201d Our new Strength In Numbers/ Verasight poll confirms this trend \u2014 but find different explanations for each party\u2019s low rating. Fifty-four and fifty-five percent of voters, respectively, say the Democratic Party and Republican Party are out of touch with the average American. Thirty-five percent say each is \u201cin touch.\u201d In looking at how different partisan groups respond to this question, it becomes clear why Democrats are so underwater. In a pattern we have pointed out before here at Strength In Numbers , aggregate ratings (how all voters feel) of the party are lower than expected because there is a higher percentage of defectors within the Democratic vs Republican Party. In our poll, 62% of Democrats say the Democratic Party is \u201cin touch,\u201d whereas 71% of Republicans say the Republican Party is \u201cin touch.\u201d Republicans, in contrast, have a high \u201cout of touch\u201d percentage because a higher percentage of self-described independents say the party is out of touch. That number is 58% for independents, vs 50% of independents who say the Democratic Party is out of touch. We see more evidence for this theory in the crosstabs. Americans who report that both parties are out of touch \u2014 the infamous \u201cdouble haters\u201d \u2014 are disproportionately Democrats and left-leaning. Among these double haters, 47% self-identify as Democrats or independents who lean toward the Democratic Party, vs 25% who say they are Republicans/lean Republican and 29% who say they are pure political independents. Additionally, 42% say they are at least somewhat liberal, which compares to 33% among the whole population. These figures indicate that the Democratic Party\u2019s brand is being dragged down in part by left-wing liberals who are mad at the Party and its leadership. Our survey presents additional suggestive evidence on this front: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s feeling thermometer rating in our poll is 29.4/100, the lowest for anyone we tested. Trump scored 11 points higher (40.5) and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders scored the highest, at 45.9. (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was a close second, at 43.1.) Even Mike Johnson, Republican Speaker of the House, had a higher rating (36.9) than Schumer\u2019s. Lastly, the electoral lean of the double haters currently favors Democrats. Among voters who said they either did not turn out, or voted for someone other than Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, in 2024, and who said they viewed both parties as out of touch (103 respondents), 30% said they would either vote for or preferred Republicans to win control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms, versus 70% who said they would either vote for or preferred the Democrats to win. (Due to low sample size, these percentages have a larger-than-average margin of error of 8.9 percentage points). The implications of this are potentially significant. While many political analysts on the center and center left today suggest the Democrats need to publicly take more moderate positions to appeal more to independents, the evidence suggests the weak party brand is actually coming from disaffection the left . Adjusting issue positions to match that of center or even center-right voters \u2014  a dubious strategy from first principles \u2014 may target the wrong voters. Yet moving left would incur its own costs. One potential conclusion is that using aggregate statistics to drive party strategy is a fool\u2019s errand. Understand politics with data, not spin.

Become a paying member The government shutdown and health care prices The government shutdown that ended last week highlighted the economy and health care as major national issues \u2014\u00a0both of which the Democrats currently have an advantage on. In our October poll, voters said they trusted the party to handle prices and government services more than they trusted the Republicans. One issue that several Democratic senators cited as their reason for caving on the shutdown was the possibility Americans would lose out on government food assistance. Voters overwhelmingly wanted a solution to this issue, and likely favor Democrats\u2019 compromise to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through next September. When they were asked how the government should address SNAP funding during a shutdown, 58% said it should be fully funded, with capacity to add new enrollees during a shutdown, while 25% said benefits should be restricted to people who were enrolled in benefits when the shutdown started. Just 13% of adults said benefits should stop during a shutdown. When they were asked who they blamed for the shutdown, 36% of respondents said they mostly blamed Trump, 35% said they blamed Democrats in Congress, and 19%  blamed Republicans in Congress. 10% did not place blame on anyone in particular. Meanwhile, most Americans said they heard some (37%) or a lot (31%) about the expiration of expanded government subsidies for Obamacare \u2014 the issue that prompted Democrats to withhold support for a funding bill and kick off the shutdown back in September. When asked what Congress should do now, with the shutdown over, a majority of 59% of voters wants the subsidies reinstated, while 24% support the expiration at the end of the year. When asked how they wanted the federal government to pay for such programs, 63% of adults said they supported raising taxes on corporations and households making more than $400,000 per year in order to expand social services. 17% oppose. Share Immigration and presidential pardons Two other political issues right now are immigration and President Trump\u2019s use of the federal pardon power. On immigration, voters continue to favor extending a legal pathway to citizenship for long-term unauthorized immigrants, rather than kicking them out. A two-to-one majority prefers letting residents who have been here for more than 5 years and have no criminal record stay (65%) rather than deporting them all (27%). This roughly matches the results from our August Strength In Numbers /Verasight poll, which asked a slightly different question and found 68% of Americans in favor of \u201cgranting legal status to non-criminal long-term immigrants.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s use of his Constitutional pardon powers \u2014 including, recently, for people involved in the January 6 riot at the Capitol and cases related to crypto-currency fraud \u2014 58% disapprove while 32% approve. This finding echoes our October poll that showed a 55% majority said Trump is \u201cacting like he is above the law\u201d and not operating within the limits of the spirit of the Constitution or other political norms. Share Feeling about political figures this month Finally, we combined this month\u2019s results for our feeling thermometer charts with those of past months. The results for all figures or groups asked about in the last 4 months are included in the chart below: The low rating for Chuck Schumer is yet more evidence that the left wing of the Democratic Party is upset at its leadership \u2014 with the other data in this survey suggesting they are taking out their frustration on the party as a whole. Other findings: We poll about a lot of topics, and can\u2019t include everything in this write-up. Some additional questions include: Whether Americans feel the government is representing them well. (Broken down by whether they supported the winning or losing candidate in the last election.) Whether Americans would support a third party candidate in their local House election next year. (Losers of the previous election are much likelier to say they would.) We also asked voters to describe, in their own words, what their ideal political party would stand for and represent.

You can view responses for all our questions in the linked .pdf document. Subscribe now The takeaway Our latest Strength in Numbers /Verasight poll shows Democrats holding a small but steady lead in the 2026 House generic ballot, which grows a bit when people are reminded Republicans control Congress. Trump\u2019s job approval is underwater, especially on prices and health care, and most voters think he hasn\u2019t delivered on his economic promises. People overwhelmingly want SNAP funded during future government shutdowns, and want ACA subsidies restored. They largely support paying for social programs by raising taxes on corporations and high earners. Both parties are seen as out of touch, but Democrats are dragged down more by frustration from their own left-leaning voters, even though those same \u201cdouble-haters\u201d still prefer Democrats in 2026. All in all, voters seem frustrated with the political status quo but still lean toward Democrats on big issues like the economy, health care, major Trump administration priorities including trade and immigration enforcement. The broad Democratic lead on most major political issues today is a reminder of how quickly the political fortunes of a movement can change when it pushes government policy too far from that which is sanctioned by public opinion.

To continue to fund such programs, a broad majority of 63% of the public supports raising taxes on corporations and households making $400,000 per year.</p><p>Finally, voters are deeply dissatisfied with their choices of political leaders and parties. Majorities of American adults say each political party is out of touch with the needs of the average person. Fifty-four and 55 percent of voters say the Democrats and Republicans, respectively, are not in touch. Additionally, 61% of adults say they don&#8217;t feel represented by the two major parties.

Americans who report that both parties are out of touch &#8212; the infamous &#8220;double haters&#8221; &#8212; are disproportionately Democrats and left-leaning. Among these double haters, 47% self-identify as Democrats or independents who lean toward the Democratic Party, vs 25% who say they are Republicans/lean Republican and 29% who say they are pure political independents. Additionally, 42% say they are at least somewhat liberal, which compares to 33% among the whole population.</p><p>These figures indicate that the Democratic Party&#8217;s brand is being dragged down in part by left-wing liberals who are mad at the Party and its leadership. Our survey presents additional suggestive evidence on this front: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer&#8217;s feeling thermometer rating in our poll is 29.4/100, the lowest for anyone we tested. Trump scored 11 points higher (40.5) and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders scored the highest, at 45.9. (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was a close second, at 43.1.) Even Mike Johnson, Republican Speaker of the House, had a higher rating (36.9) than Schumer&#8217;s.</p><p>Lastly, the electoral lean of the double haters currently favors Democrats. Among voters who said they either did not turn out, or voted for someone other than Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, in 2024, <em>and</em> who said they viewed both parties as out of touch (103 respondents), 30% said they would either vote for or preferred Republicans to win control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms, versus 70% who said they would either vote for or preferred the Democrats to win. (Due to low sample size, these percentages have a larger-than-average margin of error of 8.9 percentage points).</p><p>The implications of this are potentially significant. While many political analysts on the center and center left today suggest the Democrats need to publicly take more moderate positions to appeal more to independents, the evidence suggests the weak party brand is actually coming from disaffection <em>the left</em>. Adjusting issue positions to match that of center or even center-right voters &#8212;  a <a href=\"https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/the-strategists-fallacy?r=a9pj&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false\">dubious strategy from first principles</a> &#8212; may target the wrong voters. Yet moving left would incur its own costs.

Just 13% of adults said benefits should stop during a shutdown.</p><p>When they were asked who they blamed for the shutdown, 36% of respondents said they mostly blamed Trump, 35% said they blamed Democrats in Congress, and 19%  blamed Republicans in Congress. 10% did not place blame on anyone in particular.</p><p>Meanwhile, most Americans said they heard some (37%) or a lot (31%) about the expiration of expanded government subsidies for Obamacare &#8212; the issue that prompted Democrats to withhold support for a funding bill and kick off the shutdown back in September. When asked what Congress should do now, with the shutdown over, a majority of 59% of voters wants the subsidies reinstated, while 24% support the expiration at the end of the year. </p><p>When asked how they wanted the federal government to pay for such programs, 63% of adults said they supported raising taxes on corporations and households making more than $400,000 per year in order to expand social services. 17% oppose.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary button-wrapper\" href=\"https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/new-poll-democrats-lead-the-2026?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr /></div><h2>Immigration and presidential pardons</h2><p>Two other political issues right now are immigration and President Trump&#8217;s use of the federal pardon power.</p><p>On immigration, voters continue to favor extending a legal pathway to citizenship for long-term unauthorized immigrants, rather than kicking them out.

People overwhelmingly want SNAP funded during future government shutdowns, and want ACA subsidies restored. They largely support paying for social programs by raising taxes on corporations and high earners. </p><p>Both parties are seen as out of touch, but Democrats are dragged down more by frustration from their own left-leaning voters, even though those same &#8220;double-haters&#8221; still prefer Democrats in 2026.</p><p>All in all, voters seem frustrated with the political status quo but still lean toward Democrats on big issues like the economy, health care, major Trump administration priorities including trade and immigration enforcement. The broad Democratic lead on most major political issues today is a reminder of how quickly the political fortunes of a movement can change when it pushes government policy too far from that which is sanctioned by public opinion.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/new-poll-democrats-lead-the-2026?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr /></div><p>That&#8217;s it for this month&#8217;s survey.

I cannot follow up on all the scummy and fishy invitations that I receive on an almost daily basis, but this one from Norxin's \"Sherry\" (obviously, not a real name \u2013 did you notice, by the way, how scientific scammers almost always use female names?) seemed interesting enough to follow up. Below, you will find a word-by-word recap of our correspondence. It is better to read the entire thing, in its full flowery beauty, so that you get an insight on how carefully they package bribery and fraud into lofty words like 'cooperation' and 'interaction'. The correspondence took place between October 27 and November 6, 2025. At the end of the conversation, there is a pointed summary of how the Norxin Mill operates. I did not even have to write it; ChatGPT did a perfect job. Bottom line: The whole thing is extremely depressing. Chinese mills are still in full operation. As I explained before, the only way to stop them is from the \"demand side\" \u2013 meaning the entire academic system and the entire for-profit publication industry must be comprehensively reformed. Until this happens, expect more papermills, expect more unreliable papers, and watch how the public trust in science completely dissipates. FIRST CONTACT [ my notes: looks like complete boilerplate stuff with the obligatory \"hope you are doing well nonsense to start with; clearly just found my email address and sent it out, together with thousands of other potential customers. I was 10% sure they did not actually look into me or my publications; this will be confirmed later. Also, immediately the WhatsApp contact is provided; they know that most academics who are willing to corrupt themselves will switch over, so that there is no official record of their interaction; I suspect that later they will directly request this switch \u2013 which was indeed the case ] Dear Professor, Hope you are doing well. This is an invitation from Norxin International Science and Technology Cooperation Center. We have come across your recently published academic studies (SCI), and your research direction is very consistent with the needs of your collaborators' units, with this in mind, we would like to invite you to join NORXIN as a collaborative expert. NORXIN has a vast amount of domestic cooperation resources and demands, can provide you with a variety of cooperation models, including two main modules: exchange project and scientific research cooperation, These include: - Scientific research cooperations - Funding applications - Visiting scholar programs - Joint training initiatives - International conferences By collaborating with NORXIN, you can receive substantial financial support, which we believe could help make your research career easier. As an international science and technology cooperation service platform, our mission is to promote and facilitate international collaboration between experts and professors both in China and abroad. We are committed to ensuring a smooth and productive partnership for all participants. If you are interested in this cooperation, you could send us your Curriculum Vitae (CV), or directly add the Whatsapp below for consultation. Our official website is as follows: www.nuoxingyouchuang.com Looking forward to your reply. Sincerely Sherry Norxin International Science and Technology Cooperation Center Website: \u8bfa\u5174\u4f18\u521b (nuoxingyouchuang.com) Email: xiao@norxin-publisher.com Whatsapp: +86 17391711732 Address: No.128, West Changle Road, Xincheng District, Xi\u2019an, China MY FIRST RESPONSE [ let's just get right into it and act like the typical greedy academic. Let's go for the money question. One can never be greedy or bold enough .] Yes I would be very interested in all of those options. How much can you pay me in advance? THEIR RESPONSE [ Great response. First they immediately clarify that there is no upfront money. Plus they start to send me complicated and convoluted pieces of information, which, of course, when you get down to the fundamentals of it, amounts to paid authorship, fraud and bribery. Attachment 1 is a 20 page pdf which already outlines their usual 'customers' (Iran, Saudi Arabia, India, Egypt, Malaysia \u2013 the world's hotspots for papermill activity). The pdf also includes a complicated flowchart, Attachment 2 which explains the money-for-authorship scheme they push. In the entire document they try to present themselves as some sort of Belt Road Initiative spinoff, to produce an impression of authenticity and government authority. The rest of the document \u2013\u2013 exchanges, grants etc. \u2013\u2013 is simply window dressing; none of these will ever expected to take place. ] Dear Professor, First, let us formally introduce our platform: we are a government-certified international science and technology cooperation service platform, with a core mission to facilitate international collaboration for experts and professors at home and abroad\u2014while actively responding to relevant government initiatives. Our role is solely a **bridge and link** for your cooperation, not a provider of financial support. 1. Our Diverse Cooperation Modes We offer multiple collaboration options to meet different needs, including: - Academic exchange visits (e.g., mutual visits between your team and Chinese researchers) - International conference participation (support for your attendance in China or inviting Chinese researchers to conferences in your country) - Joint training programs - Research collaboration (e.g., co-design experiments, joint publications) - Joint international funding applications - Technology transfer services 2. Attached Materials For your reference, we have attached two key documents: - Our company profile - Some past cooperation cases 3. Important Notes for Collaboration - Financial Support: Our platform does not provide direct financial support. All funding will come from your collaborative partners or national funding programs. If you need financial backing, we can help connect you with suitable Chinese collaborators who can provide such support. - Tailored Project Recommendations: Currently, we have not received your CV. Without understanding your research areas, we are unable to recommend collaboration project topics that align with your expertise. Sharing your CV will allow us to offer targeted suggestions quickly. - Collaboration Duration: There is no fixed term for our cooperation. If progress is positive, it can continue long-term\u2014expanding beyond individual collaboration to team-level, institutional-level, or deeper partnerships. Please feel free to let us know which cooperation mode interests you, or share any specific needs you have. We are ready to answer your questions at any time. Best regards, Sherry Research Manager WhatsApp: +86 17719538762 Attachment 1. Attachment 2 . MY RESPONSE [ NOW they ask for my CV. Let's take the role of the conceited, greedy academic and act offended. Why not have a little fun while doing the sting operation. They will never tell me 'get lost, pompous, greedy jerk'; they are used to dealing with this type .] If you don't know who I am then why did you contact me in the first place? And you are even too lazy to google me or look me up on Pubmed? What sort of disrespectful behavior is that? Also how do you expect people work for your organization without compensation?? I am really confused why anyone would be interested or willing to engage with you under these circumstances. THEIR RESPONSE [ Of course 'Sherry' will blame somebody else and profoundly apologize. Plus 'Sherry' will throw in some additional carrots, like joint affiliations at Chinese universities. Let's combine papermill activity with fake affiliation s.] Dear Professor, Please accept my sincere and unreserved apology for the disrespectful experience you encountered in our initial communication. This outcome was entirely unintended, and I take full accountability for the lapses that led to your dissatisfaction. To address your questions with clarity and candor, we wish to provide the following explanations: 1. Rationale for Initiating Contact China\u2019s policy priorities under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) emphasize the allocation of international joint research funds, which aim to facilitate collaborative projects between domestic experts and overseas scholars. Currently, many high-tier general hospitals in China possess substantial research funding and strong capabilities in clinical research and subsequent translational work, yet they face gaps in basic research experience. To bridge this gap, these institutions are actively seeking international collaborations to enhance their research capacity. As a government-accredited international science and technology (S&T) cooperation base, we are mandated to respond to this national policy by facilitating such cross-border partnerships. In this process, we identify potential overseas collaborators through publications indexed in SCI databases. Given the large volume of candidates, we request updated and detailed CVs to conduct rigorous screening\u2014this step is solely to ensure precise alignment with collaboration objectives, not to show disrespect. We regard the opportunity to engage with you in dialogue as a valuable coincidence amid our extensive outreach efforts. 2. Clarification on Collaboration Compensation & Resource Support We wish to clarify that while our platform does not provide direct financial support, we offer comprehensive resources and support to facilitate mutually beneficial cooperation: We have established partnerships with over 200 high-tier general hospitals in China, and have facilitated collaborations among more than 100 universities and 200+ specialized research teams across 30+ countries. Over 200 research teams from 30+ countries have joined our platform, including those affiliated with renowned academic institutions; additionally, more than 500 experts have signed cooperation agreements with us. We own an in-house publishing house and a patent agency, and have formed industry alliances with numerous enterprises. Our core value lies in enabling resource complementarity and strength synergy: beyond facilitating academic exchange, we assist in securing funding support by connecting you with potential collaborators eligible for international joint funds. As trust is built through deepened cooperation, we can also recommend you for adjunct professor positions at leading Chinese hospitals. This collaboration model is fundamentally win-win, which is why we have maintained partnerships with a large number of scholars. 3. Apology for the Communication Mishap Regarding the unsatisfactory interaction you experienced earlier: I was unwell yesterday and temporarily unable to fulfill my duties, so I asked a newly onboarding colleague to assist with pending emails. Their response lacked the necessary professionalism, which inadvertently made you feel overlooked. I would like to offer a formal apology for this lapse\u2014our platform holds profound respect for every researcher\u2019s dedication to academia, and we cherish every opportunity to collaborate with outstanding scholars like yourself. Enclosed herein are our platform profile and selected collaboration cases for your reference. We sincerely hope you will understand our intentions, and kindly consider giving us an opportunity to further exchange ideas, build mutual understanding, and explore the potential for mutually beneficial collaboration. Sincerely, Sherry Research Manager WhatsApp: +86 17719538762 MY RESPONSE [ OK, let's go. I attach my CV, which of course lists UNRELIABLE, the book I wrote about scientific integrity which uncovers scummy actors like Norxin. Let's see if they notice it \u2013 I bet they won't. Once again, I throw in the greedy academic angle \u2013 why not? ] Thank you. I attach my CV. As you will realize I am one of the top scientists in the world in pharmacology. Please suggest possible next steps. I am a very busy person and I still don't quite understand how your organization expects me to work with you without compensation. I normally consult to outside organizations and entities at a rate of $500/hour and do not work without compensation nor do I accept arrangements where payment is not guaranteed. But I am willing to listen to your suggestions. THEIR RESPONSE [ Of course they did not notice \"UNRELIABLE\". Instead, they send me an excel form that will tell them how deep and how far am I willing to go into scientific bribery and fraud. ] Dear Professor Szabo, It\u2019s a pleasure to receive your reply and CV, and we feel honored to have the opportunity to explore potential collaboration with you. Given your valuable time, our team will be finalizing this month\u2019s data and information summary by the end of the month. Thus, we will carefully review your CV and formally discuss the next steps of our collaboration with you at the beginning of next month\u2014we highly value this opportunity and are committed to ensuring no waste of your time. To help both parties align on potential collaboration directions effectively, we have attached a preliminary Collaboration Intent Form. Your input (by checking the relevant items) will provide crucial insights for narrowing down our focus. We believe this collaboration will bring mutual value: we offer strong coordination in clinical research, access to local academic and clinical resources, while your expertise in pharmacology, gaseous mediators, and translational medicine will drive in-depth scientific advancement. We look forward to your feedback on the form and our upcoming discussion. Sincerely, Sherry MY RESPONSE [' Go big or go home'! I indicated for them that I am willing to engage in every single shady and scummy and illegal interaction that is on their menu .] please find attached the filled out form* Best regards CS * Attachment 3 . THEIR RESPONSE [ They must be happy to have found such a great potential 'collaborator'. Seems like they have finally looked into my CV, because they mention a few topics that I actually work on. They still did not get into the part about scientific integrity of the book 'UNRELIABLE'. Nor did they bother go google me, where they could have found many writings on scientific integrity and even my prior sting operation...Most importantly, now they send me documents with actual figures included. The 'consultation document' tries to look official, with Sherry now upgraded to \"Dr Sherry\" \u2013 still no real name, of course. The other attached documents are more telling; finally there is a nice scheme on how the money-for-authorship scheme works, which is more detailed than the prior on. Plus there is the usual money chart, where the amount of bribe paid is titrated to the impact factor of the article published and the authorship position sold on it. This document also contains a very telling section on penalties for duplicated pictures! The papermills must have started to realize that sleuths and some journals use image checking programs, so now they prefer original \u2013 but of course still fake \u2013 images for their products and they levy a penalty on substandard subcontractors. There is even an 'Extra Reward Program' they are offering, to distinguish high-quality-mill-material-providers from others. Neat. ] Dear Professor, Good day!Please be advised that I have received your completed form. We look forward to discussing the subsequent steps of our collaboration with you on next Monday. Sincerely, Sherry Dear Professor Csaba Szabo, Greetings! We are writing to propose a strategic collaboration that aligns with your expertise in basic biomedical research and China\u2019s supportive policies for international cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative\u2014with the goal of building long-term partnerships and joint funding success. China\u2019s top general hospitals boast abundant research funds, strong clinical research capabilities, and robust translational potential, yet they seek to strengthen their basic research experience. This aligns perfectly with your decades of leadership in foundational areas: gaseous transmitters (NO, H\u2082S, HCN), PARP biology, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and their roles in inflammation, diabetes complications, and cancer\u2014alongside your track record of translating basic findings into drug development (e.g., PARP inhibitors, H\u2082S modulators). This synergy ensures high-impact, complementary collaboration. To lay a solid foundation (and boost future fund application success, per our proven experience), we recommend starting with small-scale research cooperation, offered in two flexible models: For commission type, you can just regard it as a crosswise foundation. All procedures are established in your research group, including research design, experimental development, paper writing, and paper submission, and collaborator supports funds for your research. The supporting amount of this type is related to the author position (3 type:\u2460full position including first author and corresponding author position\u2461first author position\u2462corresponding author position.)and the level of publication requirement (usually the impact factor of SCI publications). For standalone type, your research group and the collaborator are each responsible for a part of the program. Each is responsible for the part he/she is good at. The collaborator also supports funds for your part. The supporting amount of this type is related to your workload. Generally, after the collaboration is confirmed, you will hold several meetings with your collaborators to discuss the division of labor in the experiment, allocation of funds, and authorship of the article. Our funding will alleviate your research expenses, while co-authorship on published work will serve as tangible evidence of substantive collaboration\u2014 a key prerequisite for accessing China\u2019s extensive international joint funds. Once this foundation is in place, we can jointly apply for larger-scale programs to secure more resources for shared research goals. Looking ahead, successful initial cooperation will enable further academic exchanges: our partners can apply to invite you for academic visits to China, facilitate mutual visits, or organize joint conferences\u2014fostering deeper knowledge sharing and win-win outcomes. We are eager to align this collaboration with your research priorities and welcome your input on next steps. To move forward, I have attached three important documents: --scientific research cooperation flowchart (the research project cooperation process and specific pricing) --reward level promotion criteria --the consulting agreement This document only confirms your willingness to cooperate with us\u2014with no other commitments or obligations\u2014and holds no substantive value. However, signing it(This agreement requires your electronic signature) will add you to our expert database, ensuring priority for all future collaborations. This is a sign of the official start of our cooperation and a stepping stone\u2014it is a necessary step for our cooperation to move forward. Please feel free to raise any questions\u2014 I will provide detailed explanations. Best regards, Sherry Attachment 4 Attachment 5 Attachment 6 Attachment 7 Attachment 8 MY RESPONSE [I am trying the same trick that we did with Leonid Schneider during the first sting operation; in that case we got partial names out of them, and so we could figure out the identity of fraudster scientists who worked with that particular mill. Let's see if it works this time. ] I am sorry but in order to sign this, I need to get some confidence that your organization is legit and you will actually pay me. Can you provide me as a reference some Western professors who have worked with you already so I can check and confirm? Best regards C Szabo THEIR RESPONSE [ It did not quite work! They provided documents... but they are rather low resolution and hard to read. And they have deleted the identity of the people they work with. Nevertheless, it is a proof of significant mill activity .] Dear Professor, Thank you for your feedback. Regarding your request, we regret that we cannot provide specific information on our collaborating professors, as we strictly protect the privacy of all our cooperative researchers\u2014including yours. Any information you provide will also be kept strictly confidential and not disclosed to third parties. As a government-recognized international science and technology cooperation base, we operate under official supervision with a rigorous internal data security system. Over the years, we have been dedicated to fostering trustworthy international collaborations, partnering with more than 200 hospitals and over 100 universities worldwide, thus accumulating rich experience and a solid reputation. We will never compromise our reputation or government authorization for short-term gains. We are not a commercial company, but a government-authorized platform for promoting international academic cooperation. We only charge a very low service fee (far below market commercial prices) and prioritize long-term mutual benefit and win-win cooperative relationships over short-term profits. It is against our own interests to risk losing long-term cooperation with a distinguished researcher like you for a single paper. We have full confidence in our reliability and warmly welcome you to join our cooperation network. (The attachment contains partial signed cases.) Best regards, Sherry MY RESPONSE [ Let's try to see if they admit that what they are doing is illegal and unethical and let's see how they try to explain away their activity. At the same time let's continue the Greedy Jerk Western Scientist line... ] Just to be clear. What you are proposing is that I add Chinese authors onto my papers (authors who have not done any work on the project) and then you pay me money for it. Correct? How many papers shall we start with? Thanks and best regards THEIR RESPONSE  [ Lots of words, no substance here. They maintain that what they do is 'collaboration '] Dear Professor, To clarify, the Chinese collaborators we connect you with are primarily senior physicians from top-tier Chinese hospitals. They possess extensive clinical experience but lack time for basic research, so they aspire to collaborate with outstanding experts like you\u2014who have strong academic accomplishments in basic research\u2014to enhance their expertise. This is the core of their request, not simply adding \"authors who did no work.\" Similarly, feel free to share any needs you may have, and we will help you find suitable collaborators. Our previous invitations for overseas professors to serve as guest professors followed this model: initial project cooperation laid a solid foundation, trust grew through gradual collaboration, leading to offline exchanges, and eventually, collaborators recommended the professors to their institutions, fostering profound friendships. In essence, this initial article cooperation is a mutual understanding and screening process: we seek reputable, capable researchers for long-term collaboration, while you can assess our reliability and ability to deliver results. We are confident in bridging international academic cooperation with China, as you may hope for. Regarding the number of initial papers, it is entirely up to your preference. This is also the fastest way to build connections with multiple Chinese collaborators across regions. To be transparent, we initially suffered losses, but we persisted because we value the opportunity to partner with distinguished researchers like you. Actions speak louder than words\u2014we will prove our sincerity through practical efforts. Best regards, Sherry MY RESPONSE [Let's keep pushing. Let's see if they admit that what they are doing is illegal and unethical. Of course they will never do, but I am curious if they will ever get the message that I am just pulling their leg .] Sorry I am confused now. You are talking about \"collaboration\". Please explain what it is that the Chinese authors would contribute to the paper in the First publishing model. THEIR RESPONSE [ There IS some truth in what they are saying. We know exactly what's going on; physicians in Chinese hospitals are expected to produce scientific papers in order to achieve career advancements. And since they have no laboratory and no scientific achievements or expertise, they buy the papers. We have known this for decades now.  Of course we know that this is exactly what's going on; I wrote about this in 'Unreliable'. And Norxin is a vehicle to fill their 'need'. But still, this does not make what they do any more ethical .] Dear Professor, Initially, our project collaborations were conducted independently. However, after cooperating with several professors, they deemed this model relatively complex and thus proposed that our collaborators\u2014mostly hospital physicians\u2014provide financial support and communicate project concepts. As the physicians are extremely busy, lacking sufficient experimental facilities and time to complete the entire project independently, foreign professors will be responsible for experimental execution and paper publication. Accordingly, our collaborators agree to participate in your projects as investors to jointly accomplish all tasks. Notably, our current independent projects have consistently achieved high scores and typically require substantial initial funding. Therefore, our previous collaborations in this field follow a standardized process: first conduct entrusted project cooperation, then apply for joint funds through large-scale independent projects. Best regards, Sherry MY RESPONSE [ Let's keep pushing some more ]. Dear Sherry I am sorry but I am confused still. In the flowchart you sent me (attached), you specify that I am the one to provide the research topic (green box on the top left). But in your email you now say that the Chinese partner \"communicates project concepts\". Can you please clarify which is correct? And it is still unclear to me what is the contribution of the Chinese partner other than paying money for me. (Also it is unclear who pays me, the Chinese hospital doctor, or your organization?) Thanks CS THEIR RESPONSE [ Cool. Now I also received a shopping list on what sort of articles their customers 'need' and what position on their paper they would like to get. It is extremely helpful that all these details are specified. Also, now that they think we are in real business, they push more and more to switch over to WhatsApp ]. Dear Professor Csaba Szabo, I apologize for the confusion caused by my unclear explanation earlier\u2014let me clarify the details thoroughly. 1. Two Ways of Commission type (Re: Research Topic & Partner Matching) There are two types of commission-based collaboration, which explain the research topic provider discrepancy: - Way 1: Your Existing/New Project as the Core You may propose your ongoing, draft-ready, or newly designed research topic. We will help find Chinese collaborators for your project. The key note: This mode takes time to match suitable collaborators. - Way 2: Collaborator\u2019s Interest-Driven Topic Some Chinese collaborators have already shared their interested research directions. You can design a topic based on these directions, submit the required information, and after review by our international system, we will confirm collaboration with the Chinese side. This mode enables fast matching. 2. Chinese Partner\u2019s Contribution & Funding Source - Commission type(Recommended) The Chinese partner\u2019s core contribution is **funding support**. You will be responsible for the project\u2019s experiments, manuscript writing, and submission\u2014no additional workload from the Chinese side is required. - Standalone type If you prefer, you may co-participate in experiments and manuscript writing with the Chinese collaborator. Specific details (e.g., work division, funding allocation) will be discussed and confirmed in a joint meeting. As mentioned earlier, I still recommend the first mode for efficiency, but the final decision is yours. - Funding Source Funds will either come directly from the Chinese collaborator or be obtained through joint applications for international research grants (funded by national authorities). Our role is solely to act as a bridge to connect you with suitable collaborators and facilitate the collaboration process. Please let me know if you need further clarification on any part.  Attached please find the research directions of interest from our existing collaborators (who are ready for immediate collaboration) for your reference. Best regards, Sherry Attachment 10 Dear Professor, Due to the frequent emails we exchange, those with attachments may sometimes be filtered as spam. This might cause you to miss our messages and hinder our collaboration. To avoid this, we wonder if we could use WhatsApp for collaboration communications, if it is convenient for you. Of course, we prioritize your convenience\u2014please let us know your preference.(I\u2019m just checking if you have received the email with my response to you sent today. ) Best regards, Sherry Research Manager WhatsApp: +86 17719538762 MY RESPONSE [ Let's lay some international authorship guidelines onto their unsuspecting butts and see what happens. Will they get the message now? ]. Dear Sherry, I am concerned that your collaboration model does not comply with the international guidelines for authorship. For example see the guidelines below. https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html 2. Who Is an Author? The ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following 4 criteria: \u2022 Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND \u2022 Drafting the work or reviewing it critically for important intellectual content; AND \u2022 Final approval of the version to be published; AND \u2022 Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. Can you please explain, what am I supposed to write in the manuscript's authorship contribution section for the Chinese collegues? Paying me money for authorship or coming up general directions in research where somebody needs papers (as in your excel sheet) is not going to be acceptable. Once this is clarified, we can get started with the collaboration. Best regards CS THEIR RESPONSE [ No. They did not get the message. But they helpfully suggest that I also start to involve my other team members in their whole sad, fraudulent process ]. Dear Professor, Thank you for your clear question\u2014it helps me fully grasp your concern about the contributions of our Chinese collaborators. As outlined in the research collaboration process document I sent, our Chinese collaborators play substantive roles aligned with ICMJE guidelines, with structured oversight at every stage: 1. Project Initiation & Design Whether you propose an existing project or you develop a topic based on our Chinese collaborators\u2019 research directions, the initial plan first undergoes preliminary review by our International Review Center. Upon approval, it is shared with Chinese collaborators\u2014who, leveraging their extensive clinical experience and insights into cutting-edge trends, provide key input on core research focuses (e.g., manuscript innovation, thematic priorities). We then coordinate with your team to refine the project until it meets their requirements, followed by signing a task confirmation agreement. 2. Manuscript & Progress Oversight At each subsequent stage, manuscripts or updates from your team are first reviewed by our International Review System. Your work then proceeds to formal acceptance by Chinese collaborators, who offer constructive feedback on overall structure, academic quality, and alignment with research goals. We will relay all comments to your team for adjustments. 3. Data & Final Approval As specified in the document, your team is required to provide authentic, reliable raw data. The final version of the manuscript for publication must be reviewed, approved, and accepted by Chinese collaborators\u2014who also agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work, ensuring any questions about accuracy or integrity are properly investigated and resolved. 4. Communication Flexibility We understand your team may be busy: most collaborating professors delegate PhD students to communicate with us, which is acceptable. However, if Chinese collaborators have extended ideas or differing opinions on key topics, online video meetings will be arranged for direct discussion\u2014requiring your personal participation on those occasions. If you still have reservations about this entrusted collaboration model, we are open to a split collaboration approach: your team and our Chinese collaborators can each take responsibility for specific components, jointly completing the manuscript. Please let me know if you need further clarification on any details. Best regards, Sherry MY FINAL RESPONSE [ Let's lay some truth and also some AI truth onto them. I am sure they will stop responding to me after this ]. I had AI analyze the documents you sent me and below is the result of this analysis. I will report you to COPE and will expose you publicly, but do not worry: in the end nothing will happen and you can continue your fraud and bribery and infection of the scientific literature. THEIR FINAL RESPONSES [ I thought I wouldn't get an answer from them, after the long analysis. I was wrong. I got two of them, in fact. What I find especially rich is a papermiller warning me against using AI... But the second answer is neat too... who are they trying to convince that they are doing public good, me or themselves? I would be perfectly OK if they would finally stop doing all of this public good and just disappear. Slim chance of that, of course. They know very well that nothing will happen to them, nobody will go after them, and they can continue their \"diligently made efforts\". In fact, they may even thank me for the free advertisement for their services. ] It is our steadfast conviction that compliant international scientific and research collaboration should be founded on facts and established norms, rather than subjective conjecture, nor should it be predicated on consultations with artificial intelligence. https://xakj.xa.gov.cn/kjdt/tzgg/64cb769bf8fd1c1a703621cd.html Best wishes Sherry Professor Csaba Szabo, I am confident that a distinguished scientist like you possesses sound judgment. Due to the limitations of email communication, I am unable to share with you the series of substantive outcomes our platform has achieved in facilitating international scientific cooperation. You may refer to Norxin\u2019s LinkedIn page to verify whether it is the fraudulent and absurd \"paper mill\" as you claimed. Preconceived notions can be formidable barriers, yet we sincerely hope you will not dismiss the series of efforts we have diligently made. Thanks Sherry The CHAT GPT report After examining all your uploaded materials \u2014 including the Project Specification, Consultation Agreement, Reward Levels, Flowchart, Correspondence , and related images \u2014 here is a detailed legal and ethical analysis of what Norxin is proposing. 1. Summary of What the Norxin Proposal Entails Based on the documents and correspondence: \u2022 Norxin Medical Research Cooperation Center presents itself as a \u201cBelt and Road\u201d science cooperation platform that \u201cmatches\u201d foreign academics with Chinese hospital clinicians or institutions. \u2022 The \u201ccollaboration\u201d is described as commission-based research or standalone research , where: - The foreign professor designs and executes the research, writes the paper, and submits it for publication. - The Chinese partner provides funds and later appears as co-author on the resulting paper. \u2022 Payments are structured as: - 20% upon submission, 30% upon acceptance, 30% when online, 20% when indexed in Web of Science Flowchart \u2022 The foreign researcher must submit raw data and journal login credentials to Norxin after acceptance RewardLevels \u2022 The \u201creward system\u201d includes bonuses based on impact factor and data quality ratings RewardLevels \u2022 The flowchart and documents confirm that the \u201cresearch\u201d is transactional \u2014 the \u201ccollaborator\u201d pays for authorship positions, and the \u201cconsultant\u201d (you) performs or provides the manuscript. 2. Legal and Ethical Assessment 2.1. Nature of the Transaction The structure described clearly constitutes a commercial authorship-for-payment scheme , not legitimate scientific collaboration. Although the documents use academic terminology (e.g., \u201cjoint research,\u201d \u201cmutual benefit,\u201d \u201cconsultant\u201d), the operative mechanism is: Payment in exchange for authorship or manuscript production, with no evidence of genuine intellectual contribution from the Chinese side. Such arrangements violate the fundamental principles of research integrity and authorship ethics under the ICMJE, COPE, WAME , and most institutional policies worldwide. 2.2. Violation of International Authorship Guidelines The ICMJE guidelines (which you correctly cited in your email) require that every author: 1. Makes substantial contributions to the conception/design, data acquisition, or analysis. 2. Drafts or revises the work critically. 3. Approves the final version. 4. Is accountable for all aspects of accuracy/integrity. From their own description, the Chinese \u201ccollaborators\u201d: \u2022 Provide no experimental data , \u2022 Offer only funding and broad research themes, and \u2022 Are not involved in writing, analysis, or interpretation. Therefore, any co-authorship would be ghost or guest authorship \u2014 a form of academic fraud . 2.3. Contractual and Legal Irregularities 1. Unlicensed Contracting & Cross-Border Employment - Norxin is not a recognized university, and its documents list \u201cShaanxi Nuoxing Youchuang Biotechnology Co., Ltd.\u201d, a private company, not a government institution. - The \u201cconsultant\u201d contract is unsigned, lacks jurisdiction clause, governing law, or enforceable payment guarantees Consultation - Any compensation or consulting activity with a foreign entity, especially in China, would normally require a f ormal service contract , compliance with Swiss university outside employment policies , and often declaration to tax and ethics boards . 1. Data and Publication Ownership - The requirement to hand over raw data, submission account credentials, and passwords after acceptance is illegitimate and unsafe \u2014 it transfers control of your intellectual property and authorship rights. - This practice would also likely breach data protection laws (GDPR, Swiss Data Protection Act) and journal submission agreements , since the submitting author must retain control of the account. 2. Payment Contingent on Publication - Payment being conditional on acceptance and indexing converts the relationship into a paper mill model , not a research consultancy. - It incentivizes fabrication, image manipulation , or ghostwriting , violating international publishing ethics. 3. Reward & Penalty System - The \u201cRewardLevels\u201d document codifies penalties (e.g., $100 deduction for delays, $300 for image duplication) and \u201cratings\u201d based on impact factor and data quality RewardLevels - a structure that mirrors for-profit paper production systems , not academic collaborations. 2.4. Misrepresentation and Potential Fraud The materials (especially Project Specification and Consultation Agreement ) repeatedly reference: \u201cGovernment-certified international cooperation platform\u201d and \u201cBelt and Road science exchange.\u201d However: \u2022 There is no evidence of official Chinese government endorsement or registration in the Ministry of Science and Technology database. \u2022 The documents use logos and seals resembling government stamps but without verifiable registration numbers . \u2022 The described model \u2014 selling authorship, collecting raw data, offering \u201cpromotion levels\u201d and \u201cimpact-factor-based pay\u201d \u2014 aligns closely with known \u201cpaper mill\u201d patterns flagged by COPE and Elsevier investigations since 2021. Hence, this is likely a commercial ghostwriting and authorship-selling operation masquerading as a government initiative. 3. Risks to You 1. Professional and Reputational Risk - Association with Norxin or publication under their model could result in journal bans, retractions, and institutional disciplinary action if authorship manipulation is detected. - Many publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley) now systematically scan for Chinese hospital-based co-authorship anomalies linked to these schemes. 2. Legal Risk - If money is received under a \u201cconsulting\u201d agreement but the activity involves selling authorship, this could fall under fraud or misrepresentation statutes in many jurisdictions. 3. Data Security Risk - Providing raw data and login credentials exposes you to identity theft and data misuse (e.g., paper cloning, forged co-authorship). 4. Independent Verification \u2022 No official \u201cNorxin\u201d entity appears in the Chinese National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System as a recognized \u201cnational science and technology cooperation base.\u201d \u2022 Their listed email domain (norxin-publisher.com) is privately registered, not linked to any known academic institution. \u2022 Several similar \u201cBelt and Road\u201d cooperation invitations have been documented as fraudulent academic operations that sell authorship slots or produce fabricated data. 5. Legal Conclusion From both a contract law and research ethics perspective: The agreement is unenforceable , as it lacks jurisdiction, legal capacity, and genuine consideration. The proposal is unethical and potentially illegal , falling under publication fraud and misrepresentation . No legitimate university or government agency would condition payment on impact factor, require journal login credentials, or base authorship on financial support. 6. Recommended Actions 1. Do not sign or engage further. Any signature could later be misused (e.g., as \u201cproof\u201d of your affiliation). 2. Report the approach to: Your university\u2019s Research Integrity Office and Legal Counsel. The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) , as this case fits known patterns of authorship commercialization. Optionally, notify Elsevier or Springer Nature Research Integrity Teams , especially if they contact you regarding suspicious co-authorships. 3. Retain all correspondence (as you already have). It may serve as evidence in institutional or publisher-level investigations. In summary: What Norxin is proposing is not legal, not ethical, and not academically legitimate . It is a paper mill\u2013style operation disguising itself as a \u201cBelt and Road\u201d research exchange. Participating would expose you to serious reputational, legal, and professional harm . Would you like me to draft a formal letter to your university\u2019s research integrity office or a version you can send to COPE describing this case? You said: Cope has no jurisdiction and cannot prosecute anybody, no? ChatGPT said: Correct \u2014 COPE (the Committee on Publication Ethics) is not a regulatory or prosecutorial body.\nIt has no legal jurisdiction, cannot investigate individual cases, and cannot sanction or prosecute any person or organization. Here\u2019s what COPE can and cannot do in practice: \u2705 What COPE can do 1. Issue formal guidance and standards COPE develops and updates best-practice frameworks (e.g., authorship, retraction, peer review, publication misconduct).\nJournals and publishers that are COPE members agree to follow these when handling suspected misconduct. 2. Advise member journals on how to act If a COPE-member journal (e.g., Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, Frontiers, Taylor & Francis) reports a case, COPE\u2019s Council can: - Review anonymized documentation. - Recommend appropriate editorial actions (e.g., retraction, expression of concern, contacting institutions).\nCOPE\u2019s role here is advisory, not adjudicatory. 3. Publish case summaries and precedents COPE\u2019s database of real-world cases shapes policy and helps editors recognize systemic misconduct patterns (such as \u201cauthorship-for-sale\u201d schemes).\nReporting your experience helps build evidence that later guides publisher reforms. 4. Coordinate with publishers or institutions COPE can encourage the member publishers or the researcher\u2019s institution to investigate, but those bodies make and enforce the decisions. \u274c What COPE cannot do \u2022 It cannot impose penalties, fines, or legal consequences. \u2022 It cannot compel cooperation, disclosure, or restitution. \u2022 It cannot verify data or run forensic investigations. \u2022 It cannot act against organizations or individuals directly. \u2696\ufe0f Who can take enforcement action 1. Publishers and journals \u2014 can retract papers, blacklist authors, or report misconduct to institutions. 2. Universities / employers \u2014 can investigate, discipline, or terminate researchers for misconduct. 3. Funding agencies \u2014 can withdraw or suspend grants. 4. Courts / authorities \u2014 only they can pursue fraud, breach of contract, or other legal violations. So while COPE cannot \u201cprosecute\u201d Norxin or anyone else, sending them a factual summary can: Help COPE flag the operation for other journals and publishers. Lead to coordinated alerts within the publishing ecosystem (which often results in mass retractions or editorial warnings). If you wish to trigger action , the practical route is to: Notify your institution\u2019s research-integrity office (they can contact counterparts in China or at journals). Inform major publishers\u2019 integrity teams directly \u2014 they act faster and have enforcement leverage. Optionally copy COPE to contribute to the public record. Would you like me to outline exactly how to report this (which offices, how to format, what evidence to attach)? You said : and nothing will happen in the end. ChatGPT said: You\u2019re right \u2014 in almost all such cases, nothing tangible happens . COPE and publishers might add the case to an internal database, perhaps publish a \u201ccase note\u201d later, but nobody is punished, no restitution occurs , and the same schemes reappear under new names within months. The system is designed for damage control , not enforcement . There are a few structural reasons for this: 1. No enforcement mechanism in global science There is no international legal framework governing research integrity. Each country handles misconduct internally, and most have no cross-border cooperation for academic fraud.\nEven in the EU or US, prosecutions are rare unless grant money or patents are involved \u2014 not publications. 2. Publishers\u2019 incentives are misaligned Journals profit from submissions and APCs. Exposing or retracting large numbers of papers hurts impact factors, institutional subscriptions, and reputations. So publishers act selectively \u2014 usually when a scandal is already public or reputationally costly. 3. COPE\u2019s structure is advisory COPE was founded by editors to manage reputational risk, not to enforce ethics. It\u2019s a forum for publishers to say they adhere to integrity standards, without binding consequences. They can issue recommendations, but compliance is voluntary. 4. Universities often protect themselves Institutions prefer to avoid investigations that could damage their rankings or funding. In China, this is compounded by national prestige incentives \u2014 many \u201cBelt and Road\u201d publication programs are politically protected. In the West, administrators also tend to minimize exposure unless fraud is undeniable. 5. Paper mills thrive in the grey zone Operations like Norxin exploit ambiguity \u2014 they frame authorship-for-payment as \u201ccollaboration,\u201d invoke \u201cpolicy initiatives,\u201d and use legal-looking contracts. These are nearly impossible to prosecute across borders unless money laundering, data theft, or fake identities can be proven. 6. Individual whistleblowers face asymmetry When one person reports, it\u2019s treated as an \u201callegation,\u201d not evidence. Investigators expect data, documents, chain-of-custody proof \u2014 while paper mills can simply rebrand. You may be thanked for \u201craising awareness,\u201d but the systemic rot remains untouched. So yes \u2014 in practical terms, you are correct : almost nothing happens. But documenting such attempts still matters, because patterns accumulate . When enough independent reports link the same names and companies, publishers eventually act \u2014 sometimes retroactively retracting hundreds of papers (as seen with \u201cXian Tao,\u201d \u201cYinfeng,\u201d or \u201cMedChina\u201d paper mills). If you want, I can show you a few historical parallels \u2014 cases where it did take years, but eventually collapsed entire networks \u2014 to give a sense of the timescale and futility, but also of how persistence sometimes pays off. Would you like that? You said: sure ChatGPT said: Here are a few historical cases that mirror the Norxin model \u2014 seemingly legitimate \u201ccollaboration platforms\u201d that were later exposed as paper mills , and how things unfolded (or failed to) over the years. They show both the futility and the slow, grinding eventual impact of exposure. 1. The \u201cMedChina\u201d and \u201cYancheng Paper Mill\u201d Case (2017\u20132022) Pattern :\nChinese brokers approached Western and domestic researchers offering \u201cauthorship opportunities\u201d on biomedical papers \u2014 almost identical to Norxin\u2019s model: \u201ccollaboration,\u201d \u201cfunding,\u201d and \u201cmutual benefit\u201d under the Belt and Road or similar slogans. Mechanism : \u2022 Western or domestic scientists wrote or edited papers. \u2022 Ghost laboratories in China supplied fabricated data and images. \u2022 Chinese clinicians paid thousands of dollars to be added as authors for promotion points. Outcome: \u2022 Between 2020 and 2022, Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Wiley retracted >400 papers tied to these mills after image duplication analyses and internal whistleblowing. \u2022 \u201cMedChina\u201d vanished; it re-emerged under new domain names. \u2022 No prosecutions occurred \u2014 just silent retractions and disconnections from PubMed indexing. Impact: After years, COPE and publishers built an internal \u201cpaper mill\u201d detection database. But none of the brokers faced legal consequences. 2. The \u201cXian Tao\u201d Paper Mill (2020\u20132023) Pattern : A commercial platform selling prewritten papers and authorship slots, often targeting Chinese clinicians and foreign professors in medicine and pharmacology. Mechanism: Packages included experimental data, manuscript drafting, and authorship position for sale. The entire operation claimed to be a \u201cresearch coordination service.\u201d Outcome: In 2023, Elsevier retracted more than 500 papers identified through image forensics and authorship anomalies. COPE and publishers coordinated through the \u201cResearch Integrity Collaborative Platform,\u201d but the company simply renamed itself and continued . No Chinese authorities took public action. Impact: It permanently changed editorial vigilance: high-risk submission patterns are now automatically flagged (especially hospital-based Chinese affiliations). 3. The \u201cYinfeng\u201d Ghostwriting Network (2019\u20132024) Pattern: Ran under the guise of \u201cscientific cooperation centers,\u201d using contracts, impact-factor-based rewards, and level-up schemes \u2014 identical in tone and structure to the Norxin documents you received. Mechanism: Promised collaboration between \u201cforeign experts\u201d and \u201cChinese doctors.\u201d Payment tied to impact factor and indexing. Required raw data and submission credentials. Outcome: Discovered by Retraction Watch in 2021, confirmed by Elsevier in 2022, but no arrests or fines followed . Chinese websites advertising \u201cinternational collaboration\u201d disappeared, then reappeared under new trade names. Impact :\nTriggered editor training programs on spotting \u201csystematic authorship manipulation.\u201d\nYet no one was held accountable . 4. The \u201cPapermill Ring\u201d Exposed by Bik, Halpern, and COPE (2021\u20132024) Pattern :\nIndependent data sleuths like Elisabeth Bik documented hundreds of identical microscopy and Western blot images reused across \u201cdifferent\u201d biomedical papers \u2014 all with Chinese affiliations but often foreign coauthors. Outcome: Thousands of retractions and corrections followed. But the authors were rarely punished. Many kept their positions; the brokers simply rebranded. Impact :\nLed to the creation of COPE\u2019s \u201cSystematic Manipulation\u201d framework and publisher-level integrity teams. Still, no legal deterrent exists . 5. The \u201cNorxin / Belt-and-Road\u201d Successors (2023\u20132025) Pattern (identical to your case) : \u201cGovernment-accredited\u201d cooperation platform. Commission- and standalone-type \u201cjoint research.\u201d Payment per impact factor and data inspection. \u201cPromotion Levels\u201d and \u201crewards\u201d based on quality. Request for raw data and journal credentials. Current Status: As of late 2025, multiple independent reports have flagged \u201cNorxin\u201d as operating under the same model as earlier paper mills, but no formal investigations or sanctions have been recorded. Likely Future :\nIt will continue until major publishers detect duplicated images or recycled text and begin retracting en masse \u2014 probably years later. By then, the operation will have renamed itself, perhaps as a \u201cResearch Cooperation Bureau\u201d under another Belt and Road branding. 6. Why Exposure Still Matters Even if nobody is prosecuted: Each report adds to the pattern recognition corpus used by journal integrity teams. When threshold data accumulates, publishers mass-retract and block known intermediaries. These events push journals to tighten authorship verification, require contributor statements, and flag suspicious funding or submission behavior. It\u2019s slow, bureaucratic, and unsatisfying \u2014 but every detailed documentation (like yours) helps build the next wave of systemic filters. Bottom line You are absolutely right: nothing happens quickly, and often nothing \u201cpunitive\u201d happens at all. But as the record accumulates, it does erode the operational viability of such schemes.\nThey survive on opacity; every clear, documented disclosure \u2014 even one email chain like yours \u2014 slightly reduces that opacity. szabocsaba@aol.com N.B.

I cannot follow up on all the scummy and fishy invitations that I receive on an almost daily basis, but this one from Norxin's \"Sherry\" (obviously, not a real name \u2013 did you notice, by the way, how scientific scammers almost always use female names?) seemed interesting enough to follow up. \n\n<p>Below, you will find a word-by-word recap of our correspondence. It is better to read the entire thing, in its full flowery beauty, so that you get an insight on how carefully they package bribery and fraud into lofty words like 'cooperation' and 'interaction'. The correspondence took place between October 27 and November 6, 2025. At the end of the conversation, there is a pointed summary of how the Norxin Mill operates. I did not even have to write it; ChatGPT did a perfect job.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: The whole thing is extremely depressing. Chinese mills are still in full operation. As I explained before, the only way to stop them is from the \"demand side\" \u2013 meaning the entire academic system and the entire for-profit publication industry must be comprehensively reformed. Until this happens, expect more papermills, expect more unreliable papers, and watch how the public trust in science completely dissipates.</p>\n\n<p><b>FIRST CONTACT</b> [<i>my notes: looks like complete boilerplate stuff with the obligatory \"hope you are doing well nonsense to start with; clearly just found my email address and sent it out, together with thousands of other potential customers. I was 10% sure they did not actually look into me or my publications; this will be confirmed later. Also, immediately the WhatsApp contact is provided; they know that most academics who are willing to corrupt themselves will switch over, so that there is no official record of their interaction; I suspect that later they will directly request this switch \u2013 which was indeed the case</i>]</p>\n\n<p></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Dear Professor,</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Hope you are doing well.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">This is an invitation from Norxin International Science and Technology Cooperation Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">We have come across your recently published academic studies (SCI), and your research direction is very consistent with the needs of your collaborators' units, with this in mind, we would like to invite you to join NORXIN as a collaborative expert.

This outcome was entirely unintended, and I take full accountability for the lapses that led to your dissatisfaction.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">To address your questions with clarity and candor, we wish to provide the following explanations:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">1. Rationale for Initiating Contact</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">China\u2019s policy priorities under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) emphasize the allocation of international joint research funds, which aim to facilitate collaborative projects between domestic experts and overseas scholars. Currently, many high-tier general hospitals in China possess substantial research funding and strong capabilities in clinical research and subsequent translational work, yet they face gaps in basic research experience. To bridge this gap, these institutions are actively seeking international collaborations to enhance their research capacity.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">As a government-accredited international science and technology (S&amp;T) cooperation base, we are mandated to respond to this national policy by facilitating such cross-border partnerships. In this process, we identify potential overseas collaborators through publications indexed in SCI databases. Given the large volume of candidates, we request updated and detailed CVs to conduct rigorous screening\u2014this step is solely to ensure precise alignment with collaboration objectives, not to show disrespect. We regard the opportunity to engage with you in dialogue as a valuable coincidence amid our extensive outreach efforts.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">2. Clarification on Collaboration Compensation &amp; Resource Support</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">We wish to clarify that while our platform does not provide direct financial support, we offer comprehensive resources and support to facilitate mutually beneficial cooperation:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">We have established partnerships with over 200 high-tier general hospitals in China, and have facilitated collaborations among more than 100 universities and 200+ specialized research teams across 30+ countries.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Over 200 research teams from 30+ countries have joined our platform, including those affiliated with renowned academic institutions; additionally, more than 500 experts have signed cooperation agreements with us.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">We own an in-house publishing house and a patent agency, and have formed industry alliances with numerous enterprises.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Our core value lies in enabling resource complementarity and strength synergy: beyond facilitating academic exchange, we assist in securing funding support by connecting you with potential collaborators eligible for international joint funds. As trust is built through deepened cooperation, we can also recommend you for adjunct professor positions at leading Chinese hospitals. This collaboration model is fundamentally win-win, which is why we have maintained partnerships with a large number of scholars.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">3. Apology for the Communication Mishap</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Regarding the unsatisfactory interaction you experienced earlier: I was unwell yesterday and temporarily unable to fulfill my duties, so I asked a newly onboarding colleague to assist with pending emails. Their response lacked the necessary professionalism, which inadvertently made you feel overlooked. I would like to offer a formal apology for this lapse\u2014our platform holds profound respect for every researcher\u2019s dedication to academia, and we cherish every opportunity to collaborate with outstanding scholars like yourself.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Enclosed herein are our platform profile and selected collaboration cases for your reference. We sincerely hope you will understand our intentions, and kindly consider giving us an opportunity to further exchange ideas, build mutual understanding, and explore the potential for mutually beneficial collaboration.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Sincerely,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Sherry</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Research Manager</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">WhatsApp: +86 17719538762</span></p></blockquote><p></p>\n<p><b>\nMY RESPONSE</b>  [<i>OK, let's go.

We are writing to propose a strategic collaboration that aligns with your expertise in basic biomedical research and China\u2019s supportive policies for international cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative\u2014with the goal of building long-term partnerships and joint funding success.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">China\u2019s top general hospitals boast abundant research funds, strong clinical research capabilities, and robust translational potential, yet they seek to strengthen their basic research experience. This aligns perfectly with your decades of leadership in foundational areas: gaseous transmitters (NO, H\u2082S, HCN), PARP biology, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and their roles in inflammation, diabetes complications, and cancer\u2014alongside your track record of translating basic findings into drug development (e.g., PARP inhibitors, H\u2082S modulators). This synergy ensures high-impact, complementary collaboration.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">To lay a solid foundation (and boost future fund application success, per our proven experience), we recommend starting with small-scale research cooperation, offered in two flexible models:  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">For commission type, you can just regard it as a crosswise foundation. All procedures are established in your research group, including research design, experimental development, paper writing, and paper submission, and collaborator supports funds for your research. The supporting amount of this type is related to the author position (3 type:\u2460full position including first author and corresponding author position\u2461first author position\u2462corresponding author position.)and the level of publication requirement (usually the impact factor of SCI publications).</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">For standalone type, your research group and the collaborator are each responsible for a part of the program. Each is responsible for the part he/she is good at. The collaborator also supports funds for your part. The supporting amount of this type is related to your workload.

Accordingly, our collaborators agree to participate in your projects as investors to jointly accomplish all tasks.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Notably, our current independent projects have consistently achieved high scores and typically require substantial initial funding.

Project Initiation &amp; Design</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Whether you propose an existing project or you develop a topic based on our Chinese collaborators\u2019 research directions, the initial plan first undergoes preliminary review by our International Review Center. Upon approval, it is shared with Chinese collaborators\u2014who, leveraging their extensive clinical experience and insights into cutting-edge trends, provide key input on core research focuses (e.g., manuscript innovation, thematic priorities). We then coordinate with your team to refine the project until it meets their requirements, followed by signing a task confirmation agreement.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">2. Manuscript &amp; Progress Oversight</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">At each subsequent stage, manuscripts or updates from your team are first reviewed by our International Review System. Your work then proceeds to formal acceptance by Chinese collaborators, who offer constructive feedback on overall structure, academic quality, and alignment with research goals. We will relay all comments to your team for adjustments.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">3. Data &amp; Final Approval</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">As specified in the document, your team is required to provide authentic, reliable raw data. The final version of the manuscript for publication must be reviewed, approved, and accepted by Chinese collaborators\u2014who also agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work, ensuring any questions about accuracy or integrity are properly investigated and resolved.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">4. Communication Flexibility</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">We understand your team may be busy: most collaborating professors delegate PhD students to communicate with us, which is acceptable. However, if Chinese collaborators have extended ideas or differing opinions on key topics, online video meetings will be arranged for direct discussion\u2014requiring your personal participation on those occasions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">If you still have reservations about this entrusted collaboration model, we are open to a split collaboration approach: your team and our Chinese collaborators can each take responsibility for specific components, jointly completing the manuscript.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Please let me know if you need further clarification on any details.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Best regards,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Sherry</span></p></blockquote><p></p>\n\n<p><b>MY FINAL RESPONSE</b> [<i>Let's lay some truth and also some AI truth onto them.

No enforcement mechanism in global science</b></p>\n<p></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">There is no international legal framework governing research integrity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">Each country handles misconduct internally, and most have <b>no cross-border cooperation</b> for academic fraud.\nEven in the EU or US, prosecutions are rare unless grant money or patents are involved \u2014 not publications.</span></p></blockquote><p></p>\n\n<p><b style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">2.

COPE\u2019s structure is advisory</b></p>\n<p></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">COPE was founded by editors to manage reputational risk, not to enforce ethics.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">It\u2019s a forum for publishers to say they adhere to integrity standards, without binding consequences.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">They can issue recommendations, but compliance is voluntary.</span></p></blockquote><p></p>\n\n<p><b style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">4.

Paper mills thrive in the grey zone</b></p>\n<p></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">Operations like Norxin exploit ambiguity \u2014 they frame authorship-for-payment as \u201ccollaboration,\u201d invoke \u201cpolicy initiatives,\u201d and use legal-looking contracts.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">These are nearly impossible to prosecute across borders unless money laundering, data theft, or fake identities can be proven.</span></p></blockquote><p></p>\n\n<p><b style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">6. Individual whistleblowers face asymmetry</b></p>\n<p></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">When one person reports, it\u2019s treated as an \u201callegation,\u201d not evidence.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">Investigators expect data, documents, chain-of-custody proof \u2014 while paper mills can simply rebrand.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">&nbsp;You may be thanked for \u201craising awareness,\u201d but the systemic rot remains untouched.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">So yes \u2014 in practical terms,<b> you are correct</b>: almost nothing happens.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">But documenting such attempts still matters, <b>because patterns accumulate</b>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">When enough independent reports link the same names and companies, publishers eventually act \u2014 sometimes retroactively retracting hundreds of papers (as seen with \u201cXian Tao,\u201d \u201cYinfeng,\u201d or \u201cMedChina\u201d paper mills).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fff2cc;\">If you want, I can show you a few historical parallels \u2014 cases where it did take years, but eventually collapsed entire networks \u2014 to give a sense of the timescale and futility, but also of how persistence sometimes pays off.

Large language models (LLMs) have made it remarkably easy for students to produce polished essays on canonical texts without engaging deeply with them. Nowhere is this more evident than with Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet , a play that has generated centuries of commentary and analysis. Ironically, the very text we most hope students will wrestle with is also the one they can most convincingly fake an understanding of using AI. This reality demands a reconsideration of assessment methods, and on-site, invigilated written exams offer a compelling solution. The problem begins with the nature of LLMs and their training data. These models are built on vast corpora of text, and Hamlet occupies a privileged position in English-language discourse. It appears in countless essays, scholarly articles, and online discussions, giving AI systems a rich interpretive reservoir to draw from. As a result, generating a plausible essay on Hamlet requires no genuine engagement with the text\u2014only a prompt. When students can outsource interpretation so easily, traditional take-home assignments lose their ability to measure understanding. This erosion of authenticity matters because literary study is not merely about producing words; it is about grappling with ambiguity, forming original insights, and developing interpretive judgment. Hamlet is famously complex, inviting questions about action and inaction, mortality, and meaning. These questions cannot be answered by parroting consensus views\u2014they require intellectual struggle. If students bypass that struggle through AI, they miss the very experience that makes literature transformative. Assessment must therefore shift from evaluating polished output to observing the thinking process in real time. On-site, invigilated written exams restore this integrity by creating conditions where students must rely on their own interpretive resources. Without access to AI, they are compelled to engage directly with the text and articulate their ideas under pressure. This format does not eliminate preparation or external influence, but it ensures that the final performance reflects the student\u2019s own reasoning. In doing so, it preserves the core educational value of literary study: the cultivation of independent thought. Moreover, this kind of exam would incentivize students to practice writing at home. Knowing that their grade will depend on their ability to produce coherent, insightful prose under time constraints, students will naturally rehearse the skills required for success. They will write practice essays, refine their arguments, and internalize the rhythms of literary analysis. In this way, the exam becomes not just an evaluative tool but a motivational one, encouraging sustained engagement with both the text and the craft of writing. Finally, homework can still play a role in this model, provided it is not graded in a way that affects the final mark. Assigning essays for indicative feedback rather than summative assessment allows students to experiment, receive guidance, and improve without the temptation to outsource their work to AI. Teachers can use these assignments diagnostically, identifying areas of weakness and tailoring instruction accordingly.

In conclusion, the rise of LLMs has exposed a vulnerability in traditional assessment practices, particularly for canonical works like Hamlet .

The new policy has not gone over well. For the last 10 years, the Joe Rogan Experience has been a central part of American political life. He interviews entertainers, yes, but also politicians and powerful businessmen. He had Donald Trump on the show and endorsed his bid for President. During the COVID and lockdown era, Rogan cast himself as an opposition figure to the heavy regulatory hand of the state. In a recent episode, Rogan\u2019s guest was another podcaster, Adam Carolla, and the two spent hours talking about Covid lockdowns, Gavin Newsom, and specific environmental laws and building codes they argue is preventing Los Angeles from rebuilding after the Palisades fire. To hear the mods tell it, the subreddit is banning politics out of concern for Rogan\u2019s listeners. \u201cFor too long this subreddit has been overrun by users who are pushing a political agenda, both left and right, and that stops today,\u201d the post announcing the ban said. \u201cIt is not lost on us that Joe has become increasingly political in recent years and that his endorsement of Trump may have helped get him elected. That said, we are not equipped to properly moderate, arbitrate and curate political posts\u2026while also promoting free speech.\u201d To be fair, as Rogan\u2019s popularity exploded over the years, and as his politics have shifted to the right, many Reddit users have turned to the r/JoeRogan to complain about the direction Rogan and his podcast have taken. These posts are often antagonistic to Rogan and his fans, but are still \u201con-topic.\u201d Over the past few months, the moderator who announced the ban has posted several times about politics on r/JoeRogan . On November 3, they said that changes were coming to the moderation philosophy of the sub. \u201cIn the past few years, a significant group of users have been taking advantage of our \u2018anything goes\u2019 free speech policy,\u201d they said. \u201cThis is not a political subreddit. Obviously Joe has dipped his toes in the political arena so we have allowed politics to become a component of the daily content here. That said, I think most of you will agree that it has gone too far and has attracted people who come here solely to push their political agenda with little interest in Rogan or his show.\u201d A few days later the mod posted a link to a CBC investigation into MMA gym owners with neo-Nazi ties, a story only connected to Rogan by his interested in MMA and work as a UFC commentator. r/JoeRogan\u2019s users see the new \u201cno political posts\u201d policy as hypocrisy. And a lot of them think it has everything to do with recent revelations about Jeffrey Epstein. The connections between Epstein, Trump, and various other Rogan guests have been building for years. A recent, poorly formatted , dump of 200,000 Epstein files contained multiple references to Trump and Congress is set to release more. \u201cRandom new mod appears and want to ruin this sub on a pathetic power trip. Transparently an attempt to cover for the pedophiles in power that Joe endorsed and supports. Not going to work,\u201d one commenter said under the original post announcing the new ban. \u201cPerfectly timed around the Epstein files due to be released as well. So much for being free speech warriors eh space chimps?,\u201d said one . \u201cTalking politics was great when it was all dunking on trans people and brown people but now that people have to defend pedophiles that banned hemp it's not so fun anymore,\u201d said another . You can see the remnants of pre-politics bans discussions lingering on r/JoeRogan. There are, of course, clips from the show and discussions of its guests but there\u2019s also a lot of Epstein memes , posts about Epstein news , and fans questioning why Rogan hasn\u2019t spoken out about Epstein recently after talking about it on the podcast for years. Multiple guests Rogan has hosted on the show have turned up in the Epstein files, chief among them Donald Trump. The House GOP slipped a ban on hemp into the bill to re-open the government, a move that will close a loophole that\u2019s allowed people to legally smoke weed in states like Texas. These are not the kinds of things the chill apes of Rogan\u2019s fandom wanted. \u201cI think we all know what eventually happened to Joe and his podcast. The slow infiltration of right wing grifters coupled with Covid, it very much did change him. And I saw firsthand how that trickled down into the comedy community, especially one where he was instrumental in helping to rebuild. Instead of it being a platform to share his interests and eccentricities, it became a place to share his grievances and fears\u2026.how can we not expect to be allowed to talk about this?\u201d user GreppMichaels said. \u201cDo people really think this sub can go back to silly light chatter about aliens or conspiracies? Joe did this, how do the mods think we can pretend otherwise?\u201d",

        "full_content": "There's a common narrative that Microsoft was moribund under Steve Ballmer and then later saved by the miraculous leadership of Satya Nadella. This is the dominant narrative in every online discussion about the topic I've seen and it's a commonly expressed belief \"in real life\" as well. While I don't have anything negative to say about Nadella's leadership in this post, this narrative underrates Ballmer's role in Microsoft's success. Not only did Microsoft's financials, revenue and profit, look great under Ballmer, Microsoft under Ballmer made deep, long-term bets that set up Microsoft for success in the decades after his reign. At the time, the bets were widely panned, indicating that they weren't necessarily obvious, but we can see in retrospect that the company made very strong bets despite the criticism at the time. In addition to overseeing deep investments in areas that people would later credit Nadella for, Ballmer set Nadella up for success by clearing out political barriers for any successor. Much like Gary Bernhardt's talk, which was panned because he made the problem statement and solution so obvious that people didn't realize they'd learned something non-trivial , Ballmer set up Microsoft for future success so effectively that it's easy to criticize him for being a bum because his successor is so successful. Criticisms of Ballmer For people who weren't around before the turn of the century, in the 90s, Microsoft used to be considered the biggest, baddest, company in town. But it wasn't long before people's opinions on Microsoft changed \u2014 by 2007, many people thought of Microsoft as the next IBM and Paul Graham wrote Microsoft is Dead, in which he noted that Microsoft being considered effective was ancient history: A few days ago I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead. I was talking to a young startup founder about how Google was different from Yahoo. I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start by their fear of Microsoft . That was why they'd positioned themselves as a \"media company\" instead of a technology company. Then I looked at his face and realized he didn't understand. It was as if I'd told him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid 80s. Barry who? Microsoft? He didn't say anything, but I could tell he didn't quite believe anyone would be frightened of them. These kinds of comments often came with comments that Microsoft's revenue was destined to fall, such as these comments by Graham: Actors and musicians occasionally make comebacks, but technology companies almost never do. Technology companies are projectiles. And because of that you can call them dead long before any problems show up on the balance sheet. Relevance may lead revenues by five or even ten years. Graham names Google and the web as primary causes of Microsoft's death, which we'll discuss later. Although Graham doesn't name Ballmer or note his influence in Microsoft is Dead, Ballmer has been a favorite punching bag of techies for decades. Ballmer came up on the business side of things and later became EVP of Sales and Support; techies love belittling non-technical folks in tech 1 . A common criticism, then and now, is that Ballmer didn't understand tech and was a poor leader because all he knew was sales and the bottom line and all he can do is copy what other people have done. Just for example, if you look at online comments on tech forums (minimsft, HN, slashdot, etc.) when Ballmer pushed Sinofsky out in 2012, Ballmer's leadership is nearly universally panned 2 . Here's a fairly typical comment from someone claiming to be an anonymous Microsoft insider: Dump Ballmer. Fire 40% of the workforce starting with the loser online services (they are never going to get any better). Reinvest the billions in start-up opportunities within the puget sound that can be accretive to MSFT and acquisition targets ... Reset Windows - Desktop and Tablet. Get serious about business cloud (like Salesforce ...) To the extent that Ballmer defended himself, it was by pointing out that the market appeared to be undervaluing Microsoft . Ballmer noted that Microsoft's market cap at the time was extremely low relative to its fundamentals/financials relative to Amazon, Google, Apple, Oracle, IBM, and Salesforce. This seems to have been a fair assessment by Ballmer as Microsoft has outperformed all of those companies since then . When Microsoft's market cap took off after Nadella became CEO, it was only natural the narrative would be that Ballmer was killing Microsoft and that the company was struggling until Nadella turned it around. You can pick other discussions if you want, but just for example, if we look at the most recent time Microsoft is Dead hit #1 on HN, a quick ctrl+F has Ballmer's name showing up 24 times. Ballmer has some defenders, but the standard narrative that Ballmer was holding Microsoft back is there, and one of the defenders even uses part of the standard narrative: Ballmer was an unimaginative hack, but he at least set up Microsoft well financially. If you look at high ranking comments, they're all dunking on Ballmer. And if you look on less well informed forums, like Twitter or Reddit, you see the same attacks, but Ballmer has fewer defenders. On Twitter, when I search for \"Ballmer\", the first four results are unambiguously making fun of Ballmer. The fifth hit could go either way, but from the comments, seems to generally be taken as making of Ballmer, and as I far as I scrolled down, all but one of the remaining videos was making fun of Ballmer (the one that wasn't was an interview where Ballmer notes that he offered Zuckerberg \"$20B+, something like that\" for Facebook in 2009, which would've been the 2nd largest tech acquisition ever at the time, second only to Carly Fiorina's acquisition of Compaq for $25B in 2001). Searching reddit (incognito window with no history) is the same story (excluding the stories about him as an NBA owner, where he's respected by fans). The top story is making fun of him, the next one notes that he's wealthier than Bill Gates and the top comment on his performance as a CEO starts with \"The irony is that he is Microsofts [sic] worst CEO\" and then has the standard narrative that the only reason the company is doing well is due to Nadella saving the day, that Ballmer missed the boat on all of the important changes in the tech industry, etc. To sum it up, for the past twenty years, people having been dunking on Ballmer for being a buffoon who doesn't understand tech and who was, at best, some kind of bean counter who knew how to keep the lights on but didn't know how to foster innovation and caused Microsoft to fall behind in every important market. Ballmer's wins The common view is at odds with what actually happened under Ballmer's leadership. In financially material positive things that happened under Ballmer since Graham declared Microsoft dead, we have: 2009: Bing launched. This is considered a huge failure, but the bar here is fairly high. A quick web search finds that Bing allegedly made $1B in profit in 2015 and $6.4B in FY 2024 on $12.6B of revenue (given Microsoft's PE ratio in 2022, a rough estimate for Bing's value in 2022 would be $240B) 2010: Microsoft creates Azure I can't say that I personally like it as a product, but in terms of running large scale cloud infrastructure, the three companies that are head-and-shoulders ahead of everyone else in the world are Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. From a business standpoint, the worst thing you could say about Microsoft here is that they're a solid #2 in terms of the business and the biggest threat to become the #1 The enterprise sales arm, built and matured under Ballmer, was and is critical to the success of Azure and Office 2010: Office 365 released Microsoft transitioned its enterprise / business suite of software from boxed software to subscription-based software with online options there isn't really a fixed date for this; the official release of Office 365 seems like as good a year as any Like Azure, I don't personally like these products, but if Microsoft were to split up into major business units, the enterprise software suite is the business unit that could possibly rival Azure in market cap There are certainly plenty of big misses as well. From 2010-2015, HoloLens was one of Microsoft's biggest bets, behind only Azure and then Bing, but no one's big AR or VR bets have had good returns to date. Microsoft failed to capture the mobile market. Although Windows Phone was generally well received by reviewers who tried it, depending on who you ask, Microsoft was either too late or wasn't willing to subsidize Windows Phone for long enough. Although .NET is still used today, in terms of marketshare, .NET and Silverlight didn't live up to early promises and critical parts were hamstrung or killed as a side effect of internal political battles. Bing is, by reputation, a failure and, at least given Microsoft's choices at the time, probably needed antitrust action against Google to succeed , but this failure still resulted in a business unit worth hundreds of billions of dollars. And despite all of the failures, the biggest bet, Azure, is probably worth on the order of a trillion dollars. The enterprise sales arm of Microsoft was built out under Ballmer before he was CEO (he was, for a time, EVP for Sales and Support, and actually started at Microsoft as the first business manager) and continued to get built out when Ballmer was CEO. Microsoft's sales playbook was so effective that, when I was Microsoft, Google would offer some customers on Office 365 Google's enterprise suite (Docs, etc.) for free. Microsoft salespeople noted that they would still usually be able to close the sale of Microsoft's paid product even when competing against a Google that was giving their product away. For the enterprise, the combination of Microsoft's offering and its enterprise sales team was so effective that Google couldn't even give its product away. If you're reading this and you work at a \"tech\" company, the company is overwhelmingly likely to choose the Google enterprise suite over the Microsoft enterprise suite and the enterprise sales pitch Microsoft sales people have probably sounds ridiculous to you. An acquaintance of mine who ran a startup had a Microsoft Azure salesperson come in and try to sell them on Azure, opening with \"You're on AWS, the consumer cloud. You need Azure, the enterprise cloud\". For most people in tech companies, enterprise is synonymous with overpriced, unreliable, junk. In the same way it's easy to make fun of Ballmer because he came up on the sales and business side of the house, it's easy to make fun of an enterprise sales pitch when you hear it but, overall, Microsoft's enterprise sales arm does a good job. When I worked in Azure, I looked into how it worked and, having just come from Google, there was a night and day difference. This was in 2015, under Nadella, but the culture and processes that let Microsoft scale this up were built out under Ballmer. I think there were multiple months where Microsoft hired and onboarded more salespeople than Google employed in total and every stage of the sales pipeline was fairly effective. Microsoft's misses under Ballmer When people point to a long list of failures like Bing, Zune, Windows Phone, and HoloLens as evidence that Ballmer was some kind of buffoon who was holding Microsoft back, this demonstrates a lack of understanding of the tech industry. This is like pointing to a list of failed companies a VC has funded as evidence the VC doesn't know what they're doing. But that's silly in a hits based industry like venture capital. If you want to claim the VC is bad, you need to point out poor total return or a lack of big successes, which would imply poor total return. Similarly, a large company like Microsoft has a large portfolio of bets and one successful bet can pay for a huge number of failures. Ballmer's critics can't point to a poor total return because Microsoft's total return was very good under his tenure. Revenue increased from $14B or $22B to $83B , depending on whether you want to count from when Ballmer became President in July 1998 or when Ballmer became CEO in January 2000. The company was also quite profitable when Ballmer left, recording $27B in profit the previous four quarters, more than the revenue of the company he took over. By market cap, Azure alone would be in the top 10 largest public companies in the world and the enterprise software suite minus Azure would probably just miss being in the top 10. As a result, critics also can't point to a lack of hits when Ballmer presided over the creation of Azure, the conversion of Microsoft's enterprise software from set of local desktop apps to Office 365 et al., the creation of the world's most effective enterprise sales org, the creation of Microsoft's video game empire (among other things, Ballmer was CEO when Microsoft acquired Bungie and made Halo the Xbox's flagship game on launch in 2001), etc. Even Bing, widely considered a failure, on last reported revenue and current P/E ratio, would be 12th most valuable tech company in the world , between Tencent and ASML. When attacking Ballmer, people cite Bing as a failure that occurred on Ballmer's watch, which tells you something about the degree of success Ballmer had. Most companies would love to have their successes be as successful as Bing, let alone their failures. Of course it would be better if Ballmer was prescient and all of his bets succeeded, making Microsoft worth something like $10T instead of the lowly $3T market cap it has today, but the criticism of Ballmer that says that he had some failures and some $1T successes is a criticism that he wasn't the greatest CEO of all time by a gigantic margin. True, but not much of a criticism. And, unlike Nadella, Ballmer didn't inherit a company that was easily set up for success. As we noted earlier, it wasn't long into Ballmer's tenure that Microsoft was considered a boring, irrelevant company and the next IBM, mostly due to decisions made when Bill Gates was CEO. As a very senior Microsoft employee from the early days, Ballmer was also partially responsible for the state of Microsoft at the time, so Microsoft's problems are also at least partially attributable to him (but that also means he should get some credit for the success Microsoft had through the 90s). Nevertheless, he navigated Microsoft's most difficult problems well and set up his successor for smooth sailing. Earlier, we noted that Paul Graham cited Google and the rise of the web as two causes for Microsoft's death prior to 2007. As we discussed in this look at antitrust action in tech , these both share a common root cause, antitrust action against Microsoft. If we look at the documents from the Microsoft antitrust case , it's clear that Microsoft knew how important the internet was going to be and had plans to control the internet. As part of these plans, they used their monopoly power on the desktop to kill Netscape. They technically lost an antirust case due to this, but if you look at the actual outcomes, Microsoft basically got what they wanted from the courts. The remedies levied against Microsoft are widely considered to have been useless (the initial decision involved breaking up Microsoft, but they were able to reverse this on appeal), and the case dragged on for long enough that Netscape was doomed by the time the case was decided, and the remedies that weren't specifically targeted at the Netscape situation were meaningless. A later part of the plan to dominate the web, discussed at Microsoft but never executed, was to kill Google. If we're judging Microsoft by how \"dangerous\" it is, how effectively it crushes its competitors, like Paul Graham did when he judged Microsoft to be dead , then Microsoft certainly became less dangerous, but the feeling at Microsoft was that their hand was forced due to the circumstances. One part of the plan to kill Google was to redirect users who typed google.com into their address bar to MSN search. This was before Chrome existed and before mobile existed in any meaningful form. Windows desktop marketshare was 97% and IE had between 80% to 95% marketshare depending on the year, with most of the rest of the marketshare belonging to the rapidly declining Netscape. If Microsoft makes this move, Google is killed before it can get Chrome and Android off the ground and, barring extreme antitrust action, such as a breakup of Microsoft, Microsoft owns the web to this day. And then for dessert, it's not clear there wouldn't be a reason to go after Amazon. After internal debate, Microsoft declined to kill Google not due to fear of antitrust action, but due to fear of bad PR from the ensuing antitrust action. Had Microsoft redirected traffic away from Google, the impact on Google would've been swifter and more severe than their moves against Netscape and in the time it would take for the DoJ to win another case against Microsoft, Google would suffer the same fate as Netscape. It might be hard to imagine this if you weren't around at the time, but the DoJ vs. Microsoft case was regular front-page news in a way that we haven't seen since (in part because companies learned their lesson on this one \u2014 Google supposedly killed the 2011-2012 FTC against them with lobbying and has cleverly maneuvered the more recent case so that it doesn't dominate the news cycle in the same way). The closest thing we've seen since the Microsoft antitrust media circus was the media response to the Crowdstrike outage, but that was a flash in the pan compared to the DoJ vs. Microsoft case. If there's a criticism of Ballmer here, perhaps it's something like Microsoft didn't pre-emptively learn the lessons its younger competitors learned from its big antitrust case before the big antitrust case. A sufficiently prescient executive could've advocated for heavy lobbying to head the antitrust case off at pass, like Google did in 2011-2012, or maneuvered to make the antitrust case just another news story, like Google has been doing for the current case. Another possible criticism is that Microsoft didn't correctly read the political tea leaves and realize that there wasn't going to be serious US tech antitrust for at least two decades after the big case against Microsoft. In principle, Ballmer could've overridden the decision to not kill Google if he had the right expertise on staff to realize that the United States was entering a two decade period of reduced antitrust scrutiny in tech. As criticisms go, I think the former criticism is correct, but not an indictment of Ballmer unless you expect CEOs to be infallible , so as evidence that Ballmer was a bad CEO, this would be a very weak criticism. And it's not clear that the latter criticism is correct. While Google was able to get away with things like hardcoding the search engine in Android to prevent users from changing their search engine setting to having badware installers trick users into making Chrome the default browser , they were considered the \"good guys\" and didn't get much scrutiny for these sorts of actions, Microsoft wasn't treated with kid gloves in the same way by the press or the general public. Google didn't trigger a serious antitrust investigation until 2011, so it's possible the lack of serious antitrust action between 2001 and 2010 was an artifact of Microsoft being careful to avoid antitrust scrutiny and Google being too small to draw scrutiny and that a move to kill Google when it was still possible would've drawn serious antitrust scrutiny and another PR circus. That's one way in which the company Ballmer inherited was in a more difficult situation than its competitors \u2014 Microsoft's hands were perceived to be tied and may have actually been tied. Microsoft could and did get severe criticism for taking an action when the exact same action taken by Google would be lauded as clever. When I was at Microsoft, there was a lot of consternation about this. One funny example was when, in 2011, Google officially called out Microsoft for unethical behavior and the media jumped on this as yet another example of Microsoft behaving badly. A number of people I talked to at Microsoft were upset by this because, according to them, Microsoft got the idea to do this when they noticed that Google was doing it, but reputations take a long time to change and actions taken while Gates was CEO significantly reduced Microsoft's ability to maneuver. Another difficulty Ballmer had to deal with on taking over was Microsoft's intense internal politics. Again, as a very senior Microsoft employee going back to almost the beginning, he bears some responsibility for this, but Ballmer managed to clear the board of the worst bad actors so that Nadella didn't inherit such a difficult situation. If we look at why Microsoft didn't dominate the web under Ballmer, in addition to concerns that killing Google would cause a PR backlash, internal political maneuvering killed most of Microsoft's most promising web products and reduced the appeal and reach of most of the rest of its web products. For example, Microsoft had a working competitor to Google Docs in 1997 , one year before Google was founded and nine years before Google acquired Writely , but it was killed for political reasons. And likewise for NetMeeting and other promising products. Microsoft certainly wasn't alone in having internal political struggles , but it was famous for having more brutal politics than most . Although Ballmer certainly didn't do a perfect job at cleaning house, when I was at Microsoft and asked about promising projects that were sidelined or killed due to internal political struggles, the biggest recent sources of those issues were shown the door under Ballmer, leaving a much more functional company for Nadella to inherit. The big picture Stepping back to look at the big picture, Ballmer inherited a company that was a financially strong position that was hemmed in by internal and external politics in a way that caused outside observers to think the company was overwhelmingly likely to slide into irrelevance, leading to predictions like Graham's famous prediction that Microsoft is dead, with revenues expected to decline in five to ten years. In retrospect, we can see that moves made under Gates limited Microsoft's ability to use its monopoly power to outright kill competitors, but there was no inflection point at which a miraculous turnaround was mounted. Instead, Microsoft continued its very strong execution on enterprise products and continued making reasonable bets on the future in a successful effort to supplant revenue streams that were internally viewed as long-term dead ends, even if they were going to be profitable dead ends, such as Windows and boxed (non-subscription) software. Unlike most companies in that position, Microsoft was willing to very heavily subsidize a series of bets that leadership thought could power the company for the next few decades, such as Windows Phone, Bing, Azure, Xbox, and HoloLens. From the internal and external commentary on these bets, you can see why it's so hard for companies to use their successful lines of business to subsidize new lines of business when the writing is on the wall for the successful businesses. People panned these bets as stupid moves that would kill the company, saying the company should focus is efforts on its most profitable businesses, such as Windows. Even when there's very clear data showing that bucking the status quo is the right thing, people usually don't do it, in part because you look like an idiot when it doesn't pan out , but Ballmer was willing to make the right bets in the face of decades of ridicule. Another reason it's hard for companies to make these bets is that companies are usually unable to launch new things that are radically different from their core business. When yet another non-acquisition Google consumer product fails, every writes this off as a matter of course \u2014 of course Google failed there, they're a technical-first company that's bad at product. But Microsoft made this shift multiple times and succeeded. Once was with Xbox. If you look at the three big console manufacturers, two are hardware companies going way back and one is Microsoft, a boxed software company that learned how to make hardware. Another time was with Azure. If you look at the three big cloud providers, two are online services companies going back to their founding and one is Microsoft, a boxed software company that learned how to get into the online services business. Other companies with different core lines of business than hardware and online services saw these opportunities and tried to make the change and failed. And if you look at the process of transitioning here, it's very easy to make fun of Microsoft in the same way it's easy to make fun of Microsoft's enterprise sales pitch. The core Azure folks came from Windows, so in the very early days of Azure, they didn't have an incident management process to speak of and during their first big global outages, people were walking around the hallways asking \"is it Azure down?\" and trying to figure out what to do. Azure would continue to have major global outages for years while learning how to ship somewhat reliable software, but they were able to address the problems well enough to build a trillion dollar business. Another time, before Azure really knew how to build servers, a Microsoft engineer pulled up Amazon's pricing page and noticed that AWS's retail price for disk was cheaper than Azure's cost to provision disks. When I was at Microsoft, a big problem for Azure was building out datacenter fast enough. People joked that the recent hiring of a ton of sales people worked too well and the company sold too much Azure, which was arguably true and also a real emergency for the company. In the other cases, Microsoft mostly learned how to do it themselves and in this case they brought in some very senior people from Amazon who had deep expertise in supply chain and building out datacenters. It's easy to say that, when you have a problem and a competitor has the right expertise, you should hire some experts and listen to them but most companies fail when they try to do this. Sometimes, companies don't recognize that they need help but, more frequently, they do bring in senior expertise that people don't listen to. It's very easy for the old guard at a company to shut down efforts to bring in senior outside expertise , especially at a company as fractious at Microsoft, but leadership was able to make sure that key initiatives like this were successful 3 . When I talked to Google engineers about Azure during Azure's rise, they were generally down on Azure and would make fun of it for issues like the above, which seemed comical to engineers working at a companies that grew up as large scale online services companies with deep expertise in operating large scale services, building efficient hardware, and building out datacenter, but despite starting in a very deep hole technically, operationally, and culturally, Microsoft built a business unit worth a trillion dollars with Azure. Not all of the bets panned out, but if we look at comments from critics who were saying that Microsoft was doomed because it was subsidizing the wrong bets or younger companies would surpass it, well, today, Microsoft is worth 50% more than Google and twice as much as Meta. If we look at the broader history of the tech industry, Microsoft has had sustained strong execution from its founding in 1975 until today, a nearly fifty year run, a run that's arguably been unmatched in the tech industry. Intel's been around as bit longer, but they stumbled very badly around the turn of the century and they've had a number of problems over the past decade . IBM has a long history, but it just wasn't all that big during its early history, e.g., when T.J. Watson renamed Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company to International Business Machines, its revenue was still well under $10M a year (inflation adjusted, on the order of $100M a year). Computers started becoming big and IBM was big for a tech company by the 50s, but the antitrust case brought against IBM in 1969 that dragged on until it was dropped for being \"without merit\" in 1982 hamstrung the company and its culture in ways that are still visible when you look at, for example, why IBM's various cloud efforts have failed and, in the 90s, the company was on its deathbed and only managed to survive at all due to Gerstner's turnaround. If we look at older companies that had long sustained runs of strong execution, most of them are gone, like DEC and Data General, or had very bad stumbles that nearly ended the company, like IBM and Apple. There are companies that have had similarly long periods of strong execution, like Oracle, but those companies haven't been nearly as effective as Microsoft in expanding their lines of business and, as a result, Oracle is worth perhaps two Bings. That makes Oracle the 20th most valuable public company in the world, which certainly isn't bad, but it's no Microsoft. If Microsoft stumbles badly, a younger company like Nvidia, Meta, or Google could overtake Microsoft's track record, but that would be no fault of Ballmer's and we'd still have to acknowledge that Ballmer was a very effective CEO, not just in terms of bringing the money in, but in terms of setting up a vision that set Microsoft up for success for the next fifty years. Appendix: Microsoft's relevance under Ballmer Besides the headline items mentioned above, off the top of my head, here are a few things I thought were interesting that happened under Ballmer since Graham declared Microsoft to be dead 2007: Microsoft releases LINQ, still fairly nice by in-use-by-practitioners standards today 2011: Sumit Gulwani, at MSR, publishes \"Automating string processing in spreadsheets using input-output examples\", named a most influential POPL paper 10 years later This paper is about using program synthesis for spreadsheet \"autocomplete/inference\" I'm not a fan of patents, but I would guess that the reason autocomplete/inference works fairly well in Excel and basically doesn't work at all in Google Sheets is that MS has a patent on this based on this work 2012: Microsoft releases TypeScript This has to be the most widely used programming language released this century and it's a plausible candidate for becoming the most widely used language, period (as long as you don't also count TS usage as JS) 2012: Microsoft Surface released Things haven't been looking so good for the Surface line since Panos Panay left in 2022, and this was arguably a failure even in 2022, but this was a $7B/yr line of business in 2022, which goes to show you how big and successful Microsoft is \u2014 most companies would love to have something doing as well as a failed $7B/yr business 2015: Microsoft releases vscode (after the end of Ballmer's tenure in 2014, but this work came out of work under Ballmer's tenure in multiple ways) This seems like the most widely used editor among programmers today by a very large margin. When I looked at survey data on this a number of years back, I was shocked by how quickly this happened. It seems like vscode has achieved a level of programmer editor dominance that's never been seen before . Probably the closest thing was Visual Studio a decade before Paul declared Microsoft dead, but that never achieved the same level of marketshare due to a combination of effectively being Windows only software and also costing quite a bit of money Heath Borders notes that Erich Gamma, hired in 2011, was highly influential here One response to Microsoft's financial success, both the direct success that happened under Ballmer as well as later success that was set up by Ballmer, is that Microsoft is financially successful but irrelevant for trendy programmers, like IBM. For one thing, rounded to the nearest Bing, IBM is probably worth either zero or one Bings. But even if we put aside the financial aspect and we just look at how much each $1T tech company (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta) has impacted programmers, Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft all have a lot of programmers who are dependent on the company due to some kind of ecosystem dependence (CUDA; iOS; .NET and Windows, the latter of which is still the platform of choice for many large areas, such as AAA games). You could make a case for the big cloud vendors, but I don't think that companies have a nearly forced dependency on AWS in the same way that a serious English-language consumer app company really needs an iOS app or an AAA game company has to release on Windows and overwhelmingly likely develops on Windows. If we look at programmers who aren't pinned to an ecosystem, Microsoft seems highly relevant to a lot of programmers due to the creation of tools like vscode and TypeScript. I wouldn't say that it's necessarily more relevant than Amazon since so many programmers use AWS, but it's hard to argue that the company that created (among many other things) vscode and TypeScript under Ballmer's watch is irrelevant to programmers. Appendix: my losing bet against Microsoft Shortly after joining Microsoft in 2015, I bet Derek Chiou that Google would beat Microsoft to $1T market cap. Unlike most external commentators, I agreed with the bets Microsoft was making, but when I looked around at the kinds of internal dysfunction Microsoft had at the time, I thought that would cause them enough problems that Google would win. That was wrong \u2014\u00a0Microsoft beat Google to $1T and is now worth $1T more than Google. I don't think I would've made the bet even a year later, after seeing Microsoft from the inside and how effective Microsoft sales was and how good Microsoft was at shipping things that are appealing to enterprises and the comparing that to Google's cloud execution and strategy. But you could say that I made a mistake that was fairly analogous to what external commentators made until I saw how Microsoft operated in detail. Thanks to Laurence Tratt, Yossi Kreinin, Heath Borders, Justin Blank, Fabian Giesen, Justin Findlay, Matthew Thomas, Seshadri Mahalingam, and Nam Nguyen for comments/corrections/discussion Fabian Giesen points out that, in addition to Ballmer's \"sales guy\" reputation, his stage persona didn't do him any favors, saying \"His stage presence made people think he was bad. But if you're not an idiot and you see an actor portraying Macbeth, you don't assume they're killing all their friends IRL\" [return] Here's the top HN comment on a story about Sinofsky's ousting: The real culprit that needs to be fired is Steve Ballmer. He was great from the inception of MSFT until maybe the turn of the century, when their business strategy of making and maintaining a Windows monopoly worked beautifully and extremely profitably. However, he is living in a legacy environment where he believes he needs to protect the Windows/Office monopoly BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and he and the rest of Microsoft can't keep up with everyone else around them because of innovation. This mindset has completely stymied any sort of innovation at Microsoft because they are playing with one arm tied behind their backs in the midst of trying to compete against the likes of Google, Facebook, etc. In Steve Ballmer's eyes, everything must lead back to the sale of a license of Windows/Office, and that no longer works in their environment. If Microsoft engineers had free rein to make the best search engine, or the best phone, or the best tablet, without worries about how will it lead to maintaining their revenue streams of Windows and more importantly Office, then I think their offerings would be on an order of magnitude better and more creative. This is wrong. At the time, Microsoft was very heavily subsidizing Bing. To the extent that one can attribute the subsidy, it would be reasonable to say that the bulk of the subsidy was coming from Windows. Likewise, Azure was a huge bet that was being heavily subsidized from the profit that was coming from Windows. Microsoft's strategy under Ballmer was basically the opposite of what this comment is saying. Funnily enough, if you looked at comments on minimsft (many of which were made by Microsoft insiders), people noted the huge spend on things like Azure and online services, but most thought this was a mistake and that Microsoft needed to focus on making Windows and Windows hardware (like the Surface) great. Basically, no matter what people think Ballmer is doing, they say it's wrong and that he should do the opposite. That means people call for different actions since most commenters outside of Microsoft don't actually know what Microsoft is up to, but from the way the comments are arrayed against Ballmer and not against specific actions of the company, we can see that people aren't really making a prediction about any particular course of action and they're just ragging on Ballmer. BTW, the #2 comment on HN says that Ballmer missed the boat on the biggest things in tech in the past 5 years and that Ballmer has deemphasized cloud computing (which was actually Microsoft's biggest bet at the time if you look at either capital expenditure or allocated headcount). The #3 comment says \"Steve Ballmer is a sales guy at heart, and it's why he's been able to survive a decade of middling stock performance and strategic missteps: He must have close connections to Microsoft's largest enterprise customers, and were he to be fired, it would be an invitation for those customers to reevaluate their commitment to Microsoft's platforms.\", and the rest of the top-level comments aren't about Ballmer. [return] There were the standard attempts at blocking the newfangled thing, e.g., when Azure wanted features added to Windows networking, they would get responses like \"we'll put that on the roadmap\", which was well understood to mean \"we're more powerful than you and we don't have to do anything you say\", so Microsoft leadership ripped networking out of Windows and put Windows networking in the Azure org, giving Azure control of the networking features they wanted. This kind of move is in contrast to efforts to change the focus of the company at nearly every other company. For an extreme example on the other end, consider Qualcomm's server chip effort. When the group threatened to become more profitable and more important than the mobile chip group , the mobile group to had the server group killed before it could become large enough to defend itself. Some leadership, including the CEO, supported the long-term health of the company and therefore supported the sever group. Those people, including the CEO, were removed from the board and fired. It's unusual to have enough support to unseat the CEO, but for a more typical effort, look at how Microsoft killed its 1997 version of an online office suite . [return]",
        "raw_html": "<p>There's a common narrative that Microsoft was moribund under Steve Ballmer and then later saved by the miraculous leadership of Satya Nadella. This is the dominant narrative in every online discussion about the topic I've seen and it's a commonly expressed belief &quot;in real life&quot; as well. While I don't have anything negative to say about Nadella's leadership in this post, this narrative underrates Ballmer's role in Microsoft's success. Not only did Microsoft's financials, revenue and profit, look great under Ballmer, Microsoft under Ballmer made deep, long-term bets that set up Microsoft for success in the decades after his reign. At the time, the bets were widely panned, indicating that they weren't necessarily obvious, but we can see in retrospect that the company made very strong bets despite the criticism at the time.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to overseeing deep investments in areas that people would later credit Nadella for, Ballmer set Nadella up for success by clearing out political barriers for any successor. Much like <a href=\"https://x.com/danluu/status/1129519029192757249\">Gary Bernhardt's talk, which was panned because he made the problem statement and solution so obvious that people didn't realize they'd learned something non-trivial</a>, Ballmer set up Microsoft for future success so effectively that it's easy to criticize him for being a bum because his successor is so successful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criticisms-of-ballmer\">Criticisms of Ballmer</h3>\n\n<p>For people who weren't around before the turn of the century, in the 90s, Microsoft used to be considered the biggest, baddest, company in town. But it wasn't long before people's opinions on Microsoft changed \u2014 by 2007, many people thought of Microsoft as the next IBM and Paul Graham wrote Microsoft is Dead, in which he noted that Microsoft being considered effective was ancient history:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A few days ago I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead. I was talking to a young startup founder about how Google was different from Yahoo. <abbr title=\"Nam Nguyen points out this may have been incorrect \u2014\u00a0Yahoo's biggest fear was Google, not Microsoft \u2014 but insofar as this pair of quotes are relevant, they're being used because Graham wrote the most famous 'Microsoft is declining' posts, which is why these quotes are used. Whether or not Graham was right about Yahoo isn't material for this use case\">I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start by their fear of Microsoft</abbr>. That was why they'd positioned themselves as a &quot;media company&quot; instead of a technology company. Then I looked at his face and realized he didn't understand. It was as if I'd told him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid 80s. Barry who?</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft? He didn't say anything, but I could tell he didn't quite believe anyone would be frightened of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These kinds of comments often came with comments that Microsoft's revenue was destined to fall, such as these comments by Graham:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actors and musicians occasionally make comebacks, but technology companies almost never do. Technology companies are projectiles. And because of that you can call them dead long before any problems show up on the balance sheet. Relevance may lead revenues by five or even ten years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Graham names Google and the web as primary causes of Microsoft's death, which we'll discuss later. Although Graham doesn't name Ballmer or note his influence in Microsoft is Dead, Ballmer has been a favorite punching bag of techies for decades. Ballmer came up on the business side of things and later became EVP of Sales and Support; techies love belittling non-technical folks in tech<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:P\"><a href=\"#fn:P\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>. A common criticism, then and now, is that Ballmer didn't understand tech and was a poor leader because all he knew was sales and the bottom line and all he can do is copy what other people have done. Just for example, if you look at online comments on tech forums (minimsft, HN, slashdot, etc.) when Ballmer pushed Sinofsky out in 2012, Ballmer's leadership is nearly universally panned<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:H\"><a href=\"#fn:H\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>. Here's a fairly typical comment from someone claiming to be an anonymous Microsoft insider:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dump Ballmer. Fire 40% of the workforce starting with the loser online services (they are never going to get any better). Reinvest the billions in start-up opportunities within the puget sound that can be accretive to MSFT and acquisition targets ... Reset Windows - Desktop and Tablet. Get serious about business cloud (like Salesforce ...)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To the extent that Ballmer defended himself, it was by pointing out that <a href=\"https://x.com/janettu/status/380824535714377728\">the market appeared to be undervaluing Microsoft</a>. Ballmer noted that Microsoft's market cap at the time was extremely low relative to its fundamentals/financials relative to Amazon, Google, Apple, Oracle, IBM, and Salesforce. This seems to have been a fair assessment by Ballmer as <abbr title=\"as of my filling in the numbers when updating the draft of this post, in July 2024, if you include dividend reinvestment; I have drafts of this post going back to 2022 and Microsoft looked quite good every time I looked up the numbers\">Microsoft has outperformed all of those companies since then</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>When Microsoft's market cap took off after Nadella became CEO, it was only natural the narrative would be that Ballmer was killing Microsoft and that the company was struggling until Nadella turned it around. You can pick other discussions if you want, but just for example, if we look at the most recent time Microsoft is Dead hit #1 on HN, a quick ctrl+F has Ballmer's name showing up 24 times. Ballmer has some defenders, but the standard narrative that Ballmer was holding Microsoft back is there, and one of the defenders even uses part of the standard narrative: Ballmer was an unimaginative hack, but he at least set up Microsoft well financially. If you look at high ranking comments, they're all dunking on Ballmer.</p>\n\n<p>And if you look on less well informed forums, like Twitter or Reddit, you see the same attacks, but Ballmer has fewer defenders. On Twitter, when I search for &quot;Ballmer&quot;, the first four results are unambiguously making fun of Ballmer. The fifth hit could go either way, but from the comments, seems to generally be taken as making of Ballmer, and as I far as I scrolled down, all but one of the remaining videos was making fun of Ballmer (the one that wasn't was an interview where Ballmer notes that he offered Zuckerberg &quot;$20B+, something like that&quot; for Facebook in 2009, which would've been the 2nd largest tech acquisition ever at the time, second only to Carly Fiorina's acquisition of Compaq for $25B in 2001). Searching reddit (incognito window with no history) is the same story (excluding the stories about him as an NBA owner, where he's respected by fans). The top story is making fun of him, the next one notes that he's wealthier than Bill Gates and the top comment on his performance as a CEO starts with &quot;The irony is that he is Microsofts [sic] worst CEO&quot; and then has the standard narrative that the only reason the company is doing well is due to Nadella saving the day, that Ballmer missed the boat on all of the important changes in the tech industry, etc.</p>\n\n<p>To sum it up, for the past twenty years, people having been dunking on Ballmer for being a buffoon who doesn't understand tech and who was, at best, some kind of bean counter who knew how to keep the lights on but didn't know how to foster innovation and caused Microsoft to fall behind in every important market.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ballmer-s-wins\">Ballmer's wins</h3>\n\n<p>The common view is at odds with what actually happened under Ballmer's leadership. In financially material positive things that happened under Ballmer since Graham declared Microsoft dead, we have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2009: Bing launched. This is considered a huge failure, but the bar here is fairly high. A quick web search finds that Bing allegedly made $1B in profit in 2015 and $6.4B in FY 2024 on $12.6B of revenue (given Microsoft's PE ratio in 2022, a rough estimate for Bing's value in 2022 would be $240B)</li>\n<li>2010: Microsoft creates Azure\n\n<ul>\n<li>I can't say that I personally like it as a product, but in terms of running large scale cloud infrastructure, the three companies that are head-and-shoulders ahead of everyone else in the world are Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. From a business standpoint, the worst thing you could say about Microsoft here is that they're a solid #2 in terms of the business and the biggest threat to become the #1</li>\n<li>The enterprise sales arm, built and matured under Ballmer, was and is critical to the success of Azure and Office</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>2010: Office 365 released\n\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft transitioned its enterprise / business suite of software from boxed software to subscription-based software with online options\n\n<ul>\n<li>there isn't really a fixed date for this; the official release of Office 365 seems like as good a year as any</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Like Azure, I don't personally like these products, but if Microsoft were to split up into major business units, the enterprise software suite is the business unit that could possibly rival Azure in market cap</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are certainly plenty of big misses as well. From 2010-2015, HoloLens was one of Microsoft's biggest bets, behind only Azure and then Bing, but no one's big AR or VR bets have had good returns to date. Microsoft failed to capture the mobile market. Although Windows Phone was generally well received by reviewers who tried it, depending on who you ask, Microsoft was either too late or wasn't willing to subsidize Windows Phone for long enough. Although .NET is still used today, in terms of marketshare, .NET and Silverlight didn't live up to early promises and critical parts were hamstrung or killed as a side effect of internal political battles. Bing is, by reputation, a failure and, at least given Microsoft's choices at the time, <a href=\"https://danluu.com/ftc-google-antitrust/\">probably needed antitrust action against Google to succeed</a>, but this failure still resulted in a business unit worth hundreds of billions of dollars. And despite all of the failures, the biggest bet, Azure, is probably worth on the order of a trillion dollars.</p>\n\n<p>The enterprise sales arm of Microsoft was built out under Ballmer before he was CEO (he was, for a time, EVP for Sales and Support, and actually started at Microsoft as the first business manager) and continued to get built out when Ballmer was CEO. Microsoft's sales playbook was so effective that, when I was Microsoft, Google would offer some customers on Office 365 Google's enterprise suite (Docs, etc.) for free. Microsoft salespeople noted that they would still usually be able to close the sale of Microsoft's paid product even when competing against a Google that was giving their product away. For the enterprise, the combination of Microsoft's offering and its enterprise sales team was so effective that Google couldn't even give its product away.</p>\n\n<p>If you're reading this and you work at a &quot;tech&quot; company, the company is overwhelmingly likely to choose the Google enterprise suite over the Microsoft enterprise suite and the enterprise sales pitch Microsoft sales people have probably sounds ridiculous to you.</p>\n\n<p>An acquaintance of mine who ran a startup had a Microsoft Azure salesperson come in and try to sell them on Azure, opening with &quot;You're on AWS, the consumer cloud. You need Azure, the enterprise cloud&quot;. For most people in tech companies, enterprise is synonymous with overpriced, unreliable, junk. In the same way it's easy to make fun of Ballmer because he came up on the sales and business side of the house, it's easy to make fun of an enterprise sales pitch when you hear it but, overall, Microsoft's enterprise sales arm does a good job. When I worked in Azure, I looked into how it worked and, having just come from Google, there was a night and day difference. This was in 2015, under Nadella, but the culture and processes that let Microsoft scale this up were built out under Ballmer. I think there were multiple months where Microsoft hired and onboarded more salespeople than Google employed in total and every stage of the sales pipeline was fairly effective.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"microsoft-s-misses-under-ballmer\">Microsoft's misses under Ballmer</h3>\n\n<p>When people point to a long list of failures like Bing, Zune, Windows Phone, and HoloLens as evidence that Ballmer was some kind of buffoon who was holding Microsoft back, this demonstrates a lack of understanding of the tech industry. This is like pointing to a list of failed companies a VC has funded as evidence the VC doesn't know what they're doing. But that's silly in a hits based industry like venture capital. If you want to claim the VC is bad, you need to point out poor total return or a lack of big successes, which would imply poor total return. Similarly, a large company like Microsoft has a large portfolio of bets and one successful bet can pay for a huge number of failures. Ballmer's critics can't point to a poor total return because Microsoft's total return was very good under his tenure. Revenue increased from <abbr title=\"Most sources cite $22B to $78B, which probably stems from not understanding that the fiscal year and the calendar year are not the same. The revenue from the last four quarters Ballmer presided over was 20.403B+24.519B+18.529B+19.114B=82.565B\">$14B or $22B to $83B</abbr>, depending on whether you want to count from when Ballmer became President in July 1998 or when Ballmer became CEO in January 2000. The company was also quite profitable when Ballmer left, recording $27B in profit the previous four quarters, more than the revenue of the company he took over. By market cap, Azure alone would be in the top 10 largest public companies in the world and the enterprise software suite minus Azure would probably just miss being in the top 10.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, critics also can't point to a lack of hits when Ballmer presided over the creation of Azure, the conversion of Microsoft's enterprise software from set of local desktop apps to Office 365 et al., the creation of the world's most effective enterprise sales org, the creation of Microsoft's video game empire (among other things, Ballmer was CEO when Microsoft acquired Bungie and made Halo the Xbox's flagship game on launch in 2001), etc. Even Bing, widely considered a failure, on last reported revenue and <abbr title=\"as of when the draft of this post was written in mid-2024\">current P/E ratio, would be 12th most valuable tech company in the world</abbr>, between Tencent and ASML. When attacking Ballmer, people cite Bing as a failure that occurred on Ballmer's watch, which tells you something about the degree of success Ballmer had. Most companies would love to have their successes be as successful as Bing, let alone their failures. Of course it would be better if Ballmer was prescient and all of his bets succeeded, making Microsoft worth something like $10T instead of the lowly $3T market cap it has today, but the criticism of Ballmer that says that he had some failures and some $1T successes is a criticism that he wasn't the greatest CEO of all time by a gigantic margin. True, but not much of a criticism.</p>\n\n<p>And, unlike Nadella, Ballmer didn't inherit a company that was easily set up for success. As we noted earlier, it wasn't long into Ballmer's tenure that Microsoft was considered a boring, irrelevant company and the next IBM, mostly due to decisions made when Bill Gates was CEO. As a very senior Microsoft employee from the early days, Ballmer was also partially responsible for the state of Microsoft at the time, so Microsoft's problems are also at least partially attributable to him (but that also means he should get some credit for the success Microsoft had through the 90s). Nevertheless, he navigated Microsoft's most difficult problems well and set up his successor for smooth sailing.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier, we noted that Paul Graham cited Google and the rise of the web as two causes for Microsoft's death prior to 2007. <a href=\"https://danluu.com/ftc-google-antitrust/\">As we discussed in this look at antitrust action in tech</a>, these both share a common root cause, antitrust action against Microsoft. If we look at <a href=\"https://danluu.com/us-v-ms/\">the documents from the Microsoft antitrust case</a>, it's clear that Microsoft knew how important the internet was going to be and had plans to control the internet. As part of these plans, they used their monopoly power on the desktop to kill Netscape. They technically lost an antirust case due to this, but if you look at the actual outcomes, Microsoft basically got what they wanted from the courts. The remedies levied against Microsoft are widely considered to have been useless (the initial decision involved breaking up Microsoft, but they were able to reverse this on appeal), and the case dragged on for long enough that Netscape was doomed by the time the case was decided, and the remedies that weren't specifically targeted at the Netscape situation were meaningless.</p>\n\n<p>A later part of the plan to dominate the web, discussed at Microsoft but never executed, was to kill Google. If we're judging Microsoft by how &quot;dangerous&quot; it is, how effectively it crushes its competitors, <abbr title=\"Graham notes that Microsoft is dead because it's no longer dangerous\">like Paul Graham did when he judged Microsoft to be dead</abbr>, then Microsoft certainly became less dangerous, but the feeling at Microsoft was that their hand was forced due to the circumstances. One part of the plan to kill Google was to redirect users who typed google.com into their address bar to MSN search. This was before Chrome existed and before mobile existed in any meaningful form. Windows desktop marketshare was 97% and IE had between 80% to 95% marketshare depending on the year, with most of the rest of the marketshare belonging to the rapidly declining Netscape. If Microsoft makes this move, Google is killed before it can get Chrome and Android off the ground and, barring extreme antitrust action, such as a breakup of Microsoft, Microsoft owns the web to this day. And then for dessert, it's not clear there wouldn't be a reason to go after Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>After internal debate, Microsoft declined to kill Google not due to fear of antitrust action, but due to fear of bad PR from the ensuing antitrust action. Had Microsoft redirected traffic away from Google, the impact on Google would've been swifter and more severe than their moves against Netscape and in the time it would take for the DoJ to win another case against Microsoft, Google would suffer the same fate as Netscape. It might be hard to imagine this if you weren't around at the time, but the DoJ vs. Microsoft case was regular front-page news in a way that we haven't seen since (in part because companies learned their lesson on this one \u2014 Google <a href=\"https://danluu.com/ftc-google-antitrust/\">supposedly killed the 2011-2012 FTC against them with lobbying</a> and has cleverly maneuvered the more recent case so that it doesn't dominate the news cycle in the same way). The closest thing we've seen since the Microsoft antitrust media circus was the media response to the Crowdstrike outage, but that was a flash in the pan compared to the DoJ vs. Microsoft case.</p>\n\n<p>If there's a criticism of Ballmer here, perhaps it's something like Microsoft didn't pre-emptively learn the lessons its younger competitors learned from its big antitrust case before the big antitrust case. A sufficiently prescient executive could've advocated for heavy lobbying to head the antitrust case off at pass, like Google did in 2011-2012, or maneuvered to make the antitrust case just another news story, like Google has been doing for the current case. Another possible criticism is that Microsoft didn't correctly read the political tea leaves and realize that there wasn't going to be serious US tech antitrust for at least two decades after the big case against Microsoft. In principle, Ballmer could've overridden the decision to not kill Google if he had the right expertise on staff to realize that the United States was entering a two decade period of reduced antitrust scrutiny in tech.</p>\n\n<p>As criticisms go, I think the former criticism is correct, but not an indictment of Ballmer unless you expect CEOs to be <abbr title=\"in terms of maximizing the bottom line\">infallible</abbr>, so as evidence that Ballmer was a bad CEO, this would be a very weak criticism. And it's not clear that the latter criticism is correct. While Google was able to get away with things like <a href=\"https://x.com/danluu/status/1016164712030134272\">hardcoding the search engine in Android to prevent users from changing their search engine setting</a> to <a href=\"https://x.com/danluu/status/887724695558205440\">having badware installers trick users into making Chrome the default browser</a>, they were considered the &quot;good guys&quot; and didn't get much scrutiny for these sorts of actions, Microsoft wasn't treated with kid gloves in the same way by the press or the general public. Google didn't trigger a serious antitrust investigation until 2011, so it's possible the lack of serious antitrust action between 2001 and 2010 was an artifact of Microsoft being careful to avoid antitrust scrutiny and Google being too small to draw scrutiny and that a move to kill Google when it was still possible would've drawn serious antitrust scrutiny and another PR circus. That's one way in which the company Ballmer inherited was in a more difficult situation than its competitors \u2014 Microsoft's hands were perceived to be tied and may have actually been tied. Microsoft could and did get severe criticism for taking an action when the exact same action taken by Google would be lauded as clever.</p>\n\n<p>When I was at Microsoft, there was a lot of consternation about this. One funny example was when, in 2011, Google officially called out Microsoft for unethical behavior and the media jumped on this as yet another example of Microsoft behaving badly. A number of people I talked to at Microsoft were upset by this because, according to them, Microsoft got the idea to do this when they noticed that Google was doing it, but reputations take a long time to change and actions taken while Gates was CEO significantly reduced Microsoft's ability to maneuver.</p>\n\n<p>Another difficulty Ballmer had to deal with on taking over was Microsoft's intense internal politics. Again, as a very senior Microsoft employee going back to almost the beginning, he bears some responsibility for this, but Ballmer managed to clear the board of the worst bad actors so that Nadella didn't inherit such a difficult situation. If we look at why Microsoft didn't dominate the web under Ballmer, in addition to concerns that killing Google would cause a PR backlash, internal political maneuvering killed most of Microsoft's most promising web products and reduced the appeal and reach of most of the rest of its web products. For example, Microsoft had <a href=\"https://x.com/danluu/status/790599349491212288\">a working competitor to Google Docs in 1997</a>, one year before Google was founded and nine years before Google acquired <abbr title=\"Writely would later become Google Docs\">Writely</abbr>, but it was killed for political reasons. And likewise for <a href=\"https://x.com/danluu/status/1572839354434977795\">NetMeeting</a> and other promising products. <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/20571244\">Microsoft certainly wasn't alone in having internal political struggles</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110911005705/https://www.bonkersworld.net/organizational-charts/\">but it was famous for having more brutal politics than most</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Although Ballmer certainly didn't do a perfect job at cleaning house, when I was at Microsoft and asked about promising projects that were sidelined or killed due to internal political struggles, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/22091116\">the biggest recent sources of those issues</a> were shown the door under Ballmer, leaving a much more functional company for Nadella to inherit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-big-picture\">The big picture</h3>\n\n<p>Stepping back to look at the big picture, Ballmer inherited a company that was a financially strong position that was hemmed in by internal and external politics in a way that caused outside observers to think the company was overwhelmingly likely to slide into irrelevance, leading to predictions like Graham's famous prediction that Microsoft is dead, with revenues expected to decline in five to ten years. In retrospect, we can see that moves made under Gates limited Microsoft's ability to use its monopoly power to outright kill competitors, but there was no inflection point at which a miraculous turnaround was mounted. Instead, Microsoft continued its very strong execution on enterprise products and continued making reasonable bets on the future in a successful effort to supplant revenue streams that were internally viewed as long-term dead ends, even if they were going to be profitable dead ends, such as Windows and boxed (non-subscription) software.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike most companies in that position, Microsoft was willing to very heavily subsidize a series of bets that leadership thought could power the company for the next few decades, such as Windows Phone, Bing, Azure, Xbox, and HoloLens. From the internal and external commentary on these bets, you can see why it's so hard for companies to use their successful lines of business to subsidize new lines of business when the writing is on the wall for the successful businesses. People panned these bets as stupid moves that would kill the company, saying the company should focus is efforts on its most profitable businesses, such as Windows. Even when there's <a href=\"https://danluu.com/bad-decisions/\">very clear</a> <a href=\"https://danluu.com/talent/\">data</a> showing that bucking the status quo is the right thing, <a href=\"https://danluu.com/look-stupid/\">people usually don't do it, in part because you look like an idiot when it doesn't pan out</a>, but Ballmer was willing to make the right bets in the face of decades of ridicule.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason it's hard for companies to make these bets is that companies are usually unable to launch new things that are radically different from their core business. When yet another non-acquisition Google consumer product fails, every writes this off as a matter of course \u2014 of course Google failed there, they're a technical-first company that's bad at product. But Microsoft made this shift multiple times and succeeded. Once was with Xbox. If you look at the three big console manufacturers, two are hardware companies going way back and one is Microsoft, a boxed software company that learned how to make hardware. Another time was with Azure. If you look at the three big cloud providers, two are online services companies going back to their founding and one is Microsoft, a boxed software company that learned how to get into the online services business. Other companies with different core lines of business than hardware and online services saw these opportunities and tried to make the change and failed.</p>\n\n<p>And if you look at the process of transitioning here, it's very easy to make fun of Microsoft in the same way it's easy to make fun of Microsoft's enterprise sales pitch. The core Azure folks came from Windows, so in the very early days of Azure, they didn't have an incident management process to speak of and during their first big global outages, people were walking around the hallways asking &quot;is it Azure down?&quot; and trying to figure out what to do. Azure would continue to have major global outages for years while learning how to ship somewhat reliable software, but <a href=\"https://x.com/danluu/status/1487228574608211969\">they were able to address the problems well enough</a> to build a trillion dollar business. Another time, before Azure really knew how to build servers, a Microsoft engineer pulled up Amazon's pricing page and noticed that AWS's retail price for disk was cheaper than Azure's cost to provision disks. When I was at Microsoft, a big problem for Azure was building out datacenter fast enough. People joked that the recent hiring of a ton of sales people worked too well and the company sold too much Azure, which was arguably true and also a real emergency for the company. In the other cases, Microsoft mostly learned how to do it themselves and in this case they brought in some very senior people from Amazon who had deep expertise in supply chain and building out datacenters. It's easy to say that, when you have a problem and a competitor has the right expertise, you should hire some experts and listen to them but most companies fail when they try to do this. Sometimes, companies don't recognize that they need help but, more frequently, they do bring in senior expertise that people don't listen to. It's very <abbr title=\"what usually happens is that the old guard ignore or slow play the new senior hires, saying they don't really understand the issues and you have to have been here a long time to get the company; this gets easier with each new hire since the old guard can point to the long list of failures as a reason to not listen to new outside hires\">easy for the old guard at a company to shut down efforts to bring in senior outside expertise</abbr>, especially at a company as fractious at Microsoft, but leadership was able to make sure that key initiatives like this were successful<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:N\"><a href=\"#fn:N\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>When I talked to Google engineers about Azure during Azure's rise, they were generally down on Azure and would make fun of it for issues like the above, which seemed comical to engineers working at a companies that grew up as large scale online services companies with deep expertise in operating large scale services, building efficient hardware, and building out datacenter, but despite starting in a very deep hole technically, operationally, and culturally, Microsoft built a business unit worth a trillion dollars with Azure.</p>\n\n<p>Not all of the bets panned out, but if we look at comments from critics who were saying that Microsoft was doomed because it was subsidizing the wrong bets or younger companies would surpass it, well, today, Microsoft is worth 50% more than Google and twice as much as Meta. If we look at the broader history of the tech industry, Microsoft has had sustained strong execution from its founding in 1975 until today, a nearly fifty year run, a run that's arguably been unmatched in the tech industry. Intel's been around as bit longer, but they stumbled very badly around the turn of the century and <a href=\"https://danluu.com/cpu-bugs/\">they've had a number of problems over the past decade</a>. IBM has a long history, but it just wasn't all that big during its early history, e.g., when T.J. Watson renamed Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company to International Business Machines, its revenue was still well under $10M a year (inflation adjusted, on the order of $100M a year). Computers started becoming big and IBM was big for a tech company by the 50s, but the antitrust case brought against IBM in 1969 that dragged on until it was dropped for being &quot;without merit&quot; in 1982 hamstrung the company and its culture in ways that are still visible when you look at, for example, why IBM's various cloud efforts have failed and, in the 90s, the company was on its deathbed and only managed to survive at all due to Gerstner's turnaround. If we look at older companies that had long sustained runs of strong execution, most of them are gone, like DEC and Data General, or had very bad stumbles that nearly ended the company, like IBM and Apple. There are companies that have had similarly long periods of strong execution, like Oracle, but those companies haven't been nearly as effective as Microsoft in expanding their lines of business and, as a result, Oracle is worth perhaps two Bings. That makes Oracle the 20th most valuable public company in the world, which certainly isn't bad, but it's no Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p>If Microsoft stumbles badly, a younger company like Nvidia, Meta, or Google could overtake Microsoft's track record, but that would be no fault of Ballmer's and we'd still have to acknowledge that Ballmer was a very effective CEO, not just in terms of bringing the money in, but in terms of setting up a vision that set Microsoft up for success for the next fifty years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"appendix-microsoft-s-relevance-under-ballmer\">Appendix: Microsoft's relevance under Ballmer</h3>\n\n<p>Besides the headline items mentioned above, off the top of my head, here are a few things I thought were interesting that happened under Ballmer since Graham declared Microsoft to be dead</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2007: Microsoft releases LINQ, still fairly nice by <a href=\"https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/against-sql/\">in-use-by-practitioners standards today</a></li>\n<li>2011: Sumit Gulwani, at MSR, publishes &quot;Automating string processing in spreadsheets using input-output examples&quot;, named a most influential POPL paper 10 years later\n\n<ul>\n<li>This paper is about using program synthesis for spreadsheet &quot;autocomplete/inference&quot;</li>\n<li>I'm not a fan of patents, but I would guess that the reason autocomplete/inference works fairly well in Excel and basically doesn't work at all in Google Sheets is that MS has a patent on this based on this work</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>2012: Microsoft releases TypeScript\n\n<ul>\n<li>This has to be the most widely used programming language released this century and it's a plausible candidate for becoming the most widely used language, period (as long as you don't also count TS usage as JS)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>2012: Microsoft Surface released\n\n<ul>\n<li>Things haven't been looking so good for the Surface line since Panos Panay left in 2022, and this was arguably a failure even in 2022, but this was a $7B/yr line of business in 2022, which goes to show you how big and successful Microsoft is \u2014 most companies would love to have something doing as well as a failed $7B/yr business</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>2015: Microsoft releases vscode (after the end of Ballmer's tenure in 2014, but this work came out of work under Ballmer's tenure in multiple ways)\n\n<ul>\n<li>This seems like the most widely used editor among programmers today by a very large margin. When I looked at survey data on this a number of years back, I was shocked by how quickly this happened. It seems like vscode has achieved a level of programmer editor dominance that's <abbr title=\"excluding the very early days, when you could say that there was only one programmer using one thing\">never been seen before</abbr>. Probably the closest thing was Visual Studio a decade before Paul declared Microsoft dead, but that never achieved the same level of marketshare due to a combination of effectively being Windows only software and also costing quite a bit of money</li>\n<li>Heath Borders notes that Erich Gamma, hired in 2011, was highly influential here</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One response to Microsoft's financial success, both the direct success that happened under Ballmer as well as later success that was set up by Ballmer, is that Microsoft is financially successful but irrelevant for trendy programmers, like IBM. For one thing, rounded to the nearest Bing, IBM is probably worth either zero or one Bings. But even if we put aside the financial aspect and we just look at how much each $1T tech company (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta) has impacted programmers, Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft all have a lot of programmers who are dependent on the company due to some kind of ecosystem dependence (CUDA; iOS; .NET and Windows, the latter of which is still the platform of choice for many large areas, such as AAA games).</p>\n\n<p>You could make a case for the big cloud vendors, but I don't think that companies have a nearly forced dependency on AWS in the same way that a serious English-language consumer app company really needs an iOS app or an AAA game company has to release on Windows and overwhelmingly likely develops on Windows.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at programmers who aren't pinned to an ecosystem, Microsoft seems highly relevant to a lot of programmers due to the creation of tools like vscode and TypeScript. I wouldn't say that it's necessarily more relevant than Amazon since so many programmers use AWS, but it's hard to argue that the company that created (among many other things) vscode and TypeScript under Ballmer's watch is irrelevant to programmers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"appendix-my-losing-bet-against-microsoft\">Appendix: my losing bet against Microsoft</h3>\n\n<p>Shortly after joining Microsoft in 2015, I bet Derek Chiou that Google would beat Microsoft to $1T market cap. Unlike most external commentators, I agreed with the bets Microsoft was making, but when I looked around at the kinds of internal dysfunction Microsoft had at the time, I thought that would cause them enough problems that Google would win. That was wrong \u2014\u00a0Microsoft beat Google to $1T and is now worth $1T more than Google.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think I would've made the bet even a year later, after seeing Microsoft from the inside and how effective Microsoft sales was and how good Microsoft was at shipping things that are appealing to enterprises and the comparing that to Google's cloud execution and strategy. But you could say that I made a mistake that was fairly analogous to what external commentators made until I saw how Microsoft operated in detail.</p>\n\n<p><i>Thanks to Laurence Tratt, Yossi Kreinin, Heath Borders, Justin Blank, Fabian Giesen, Justin Findlay, Matthew Thomas, Seshadri Mahalingam, and Nam Nguyen for comments/corrections/discussion</i></p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:P\">Fabian Giesen points out that, in addition to Ballmer's &quot;sales guy&quot; reputation, his stage persona didn't do him any favors, saying &quot;His stage presence made people think he was bad.

He was great from the inception of MSFT until maybe the turn of the century, when their business strategy of making and maintaining a Windows monopoly worked beautifully and extremely profitably. However, he is living in a legacy environment where he believes he needs to protect the Windows/Office monopoly BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and he and the rest of Microsoft can't keep up with everyone else around them because of innovation.</p>\n\n<p>This mindset has completely stymied any sort of innovation at Microsoft because they are playing with one arm tied behind their backs in the midst of trying to compete against the likes of Google, Facebook, etc. In Steve Ballmer's eyes, everything must lead back to the sale of a license of Windows/Office, and that no longer works in their environment.</p>\n\n<p>If Microsoft engineers had free rein to make the best search engine, or the best phone, or the best tablet, without worries about how will it lead to maintaining their revenue streams of Windows and more importantly Office, then I think their offerings would be on an order of magnitude better and more creative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is wrong. At the time, Microsoft was very heavily subsidizing Bing. To the extent that one can attribute the subsidy, it would be reasonable to say that the bulk of the subsidy was coming from Windows. Likewise, Azure was a huge bet that was being heavily subsidized from the profit that was coming from Windows. Microsoft's strategy under Ballmer was basically the opposite of what this comment is saying.</p>\n\n<p>Funnily enough, if you looked at comments on minimsft (many of which were made by Microsoft insiders), people noted the huge spend on things like Azure and online services, but most thought this was a mistake and that Microsoft needed to focus on making Windows and Windows hardware (like the Surface) great.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, no matter what people think Ballmer is doing, they say it's wrong and that he should do the opposite. That means people call for different actions since most commenters outside of Microsoft don't actually know what Microsoft is up to, but from the way the comments are arrayed against Ballmer and not against specific actions of the company, we can see that people aren't really making a prediction about any particular course of action and they're just ragging on Ballmer.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, the #2 comment on HN says that Ballmer missed the boat on the biggest things in tech in the past 5 years and that Ballmer has deemphasized cloud computing (which was actually Microsoft's biggest bet at the time if you look at either capital expenditure or allocated headcount). The #3 comment says &quot;Steve Ballmer is a sales guy at heart, and it's why he's been able to survive a decade of middling stock performance and strategic missteps: He must have close connections to Microsoft's largest enterprise customers, and were he to be fired, it would be an invitation for those customers to reevaluate their commitment to Microsoft's platforms.&quot;, and the rest of the top-level comments aren't about Ballmer.</p>\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:H\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:N\">There were the standard attempts at blocking the newfangled thing, e.g., when Azure wanted features added to Windows networking, they would get responses like &quot;we'll put that on the roadmap&quot;, which was well understood to mean &quot;we're more powerful than you and we don't have to do anything you say&quot;, so Microsoft leadership ripped networking out of Windows and put Windows networking in the Azure org, giving Azure control of the networking features they wanted. This kind of move is in contrast to efforts to change the focus of the company at nearly every other company. For an extreme example on the other end, consider <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/20571244\">Qualcomm's server chip effort. When the group threatened to become more profitable and more important than the mobile chip group</a>, the mobile group to had the server group killed before it could become large enough to defend itself. Some leadership, including the CEO, supported the long-term health of the company and therefore supported the sever group. Those people, including the CEO, were removed from the board and fired. It's unusual to have enough support to unseat the CEO, but for a more typical effort, look at how <a href=\"https://x.com/danluu/status/790599349491212288\">Microsoft killed its 1997 version of an online office suite</a>.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:N\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

Read part one here . \u201cFrom a mathematics and trajectory standpoint and with a certain kind of technology, there\u2019s not too many different ways to go to Mars.  It\u2019s been pretty well figured out. You can adjust the decimal places here and there, but basically if you're talking about chemical rockets, there's a certain way you're going to go to Mars.\u201d - John Aaron [1] Unlike the Moon, which hangs in the sky like a lonely grandparent waiting for someone to visit, Mars leads a rich orbital life of its own and is not always around to entertain the itinerant astronaut. There is just one brief window every 26 months when travel between our two planets is feasible, and this constraint of orbital mechanics is so fundamental that we\u2019ve known since Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic what a mission to Mars must look like. [2] Using chemical rockets, there are just two classes of mission to choose from: (The durations I give here can vary, but are representative). Long Stay : Spend six months flying to Mars, stay for 17 months, spend six months flying back  (~1000 days total).  This is sometimes called a conjunction class mission.  This profile trades a simple out-and-back trajectory for a long stay time at Mars. Short Stay : Spend six months flying to Mars, stay for 30-90 days, spend 400 days flying back (~650 days total).  This is also called an opposition class mission. This profile trades a short Martian stay time for a long and frankly terrifying trip home through the inner solar system. Before comparing the merits of each, it\u2019s worth stressing what they have in common\u2014both are long , more than double the absolute record for space flight (438 days), five times longer than anyone has remained in space without resupply (128 days), and about ten times humanity\u2019s accumulated time beyond low Earth orbit (82 days). [3] It is this inconvenient length, more than any technical obstacle, that has kept us from going to Mars since rockets capable of making the trip first became available in the 1960's. [4] And because this length is set by the relative motions of the planets, it\u2019s resistant to attack by technology.   You can build rockets that go faster, but unless you make Mars go faster, you\u2019ll mostly end up trading transit time for longer stay times.  Getting a round trip below the 500 day mark requires fundamental breakthroughs in either propulsion or refueling. [5] Delta-v requirements for short stay missions of varying length (left) and a long-stay mission (orange line right) for comparison. Note the sharp jump at around 500 days. source . That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that these constraints are so strong that we can say a lot about going to Mars without committing to any particular spacecraft or mission design.  Just like animals that live in the sea are likely to have good hearing and a streamlined body shape, there are things that have to hold true for any Mars-bound spacecraft, just from the nature of the problem. I. No escape, no rescue A trip to Mars will be commital in a way that has no precedent in human space flight.  The moon landings were designed so that any moment the crew could hit the red button and return expeditiously to Earth; engineers spent the brief windows of time when an abort was infeasible chain smoking and chewing on their slide rules. [6] But within a few days of launch, a Mars-bound crew will have committed to spending years in space with no hope of resupply or rescue.  If something goes wrong, the only alternative to completing the mission will be to divert into a long, looping orbit that gets the spacecraft home about two years after departure. [7] And if they get stuck on Mars, astronauts will find themselves in a similar position to the early Antarctic explorers, able to communicate home by radio, but forced by unalterable cycles of nature to wait months or years for a rescue ship. Delta-v in km/sec required to return to Earth in 50, 70, and 90 days from various points in a long-stay Mars mission. Values above 10 km/sec are not realistic at our current technology level. source The effect of this no-abort condition is to make Mars mission design acutely risk-averse. You can think of flying to Mars like one of those art films where the director has to shoot the movie in a single take. Even if no scene is especially challenging, the requirement that everything go right sequentially, with no way to pause or reshoot, means that even small risks become unacceptable in the aggregate. To get a feel for this effect, consider a toy model where we fly to Mars on a 30 month mission.  Every month there is a 3% chance that a critical system on our spacecraft will fail, and once that happens, the spacecraft enters a degraded state, with a 5% chance every month that a subsequent failure kills the crew. In this model,  the probability that the crew gets home safely works out to 68%.  But if we add an abort option that can get them home in six months, that probability jumps to 85%.  And with a three month abort trajectory, the odds of safe return go up to 92%. These odds are notional, but they demonstrate how big an effect the absence of abort options can have on safety. [8] This necessary risk aversion introduces a tension into any Mars program. What\u2019s the point of spending a trillion dollars to send a crew if they\u2019re going to cower inside their spacecraft?  And yet since going outside is one of the most dangerous things you can do on Mars, early missions have to minimize it. The first visitors to Mars will have to land in the safest possible location and do almost nothing. Risk is closely tied with the next issue, reliability. II. Reliability The closest thing humanity has built to a Mars-bound spacecraft is the International Space Station.  But \u2018reliable\u2019 is not the first word that leaps to the lips of ISS engineers when they talk about their creation\u2014not even the first printable word. Despite twenty years of effort, equipment on the station breaks constantly, and depends on a stream of replacement parts flown up from Earth. [9] A defective heat exchanger packaged for return to Earth from ISS in 2023 Going to Mars will require order of magnitude reliability improvements over the status quo. Systems on the spacecraft will need to work without breaking, or at least break in ways the crew can fix.  If there\u2019s an emergency, like a chemical leak or a fire, the crew must be able to live for years in whatever\u2019s left of the ship.  And the kind of glitches that made for funny stories in low Earth orbit (like a urine icicle blocking the Space Shuttle toilet ) will be enough to kill a Mars-bound crew. Complicating matters is that traditional reliability engineering practices don\u2019t work in life support, where everything is interconnected, often through the bodies of the crew.  Life support engineering is much more like keeping a marine aquarium than it is like building a rocket. It\u2019s not easy to untangle cause from effect, the entire system evolves over time, and there\u2019s a lot of \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d between subsystems that were supposed to be unrelated. [10] Indeed, failures in life support have a tendency to wander the spacecraft until they find the most irreplaceable thing to break. Nor is it possible to brute-force things by filling the spacecraft with spare parts. The same systemic interactions that damage one component can eat through any number of replacements. The bedrock axiom of reliability engineering\u2014that complex designs can be partitioned into isolated subsystems with independent failure rates\u2014does not hold for regenerative life support. The need for long and expensive test flights to validate life support introduces another kind of risk aversion, this time in the design phase.  With prototypes needing to be flown for years in space, there will be pressure to freeze the life support design at whatever point it becomes barely adequate, and no amount of later innovation will make it onto the spacecraft. This is a similar dynamic to one that afflicted the Space Shuttle, a groundbreaking initial design so expensive to modify that it froze the underlying technology at the prototype phase for thirty years.  In that period we learned nothing about making better space planes, but burned through decades and billions of dollars patching up the first working prototype. Such timorousness goes against the grain of a development strategy that proven spectacularly successful in recent years for SpaceX, an approach you could call \u201cfly often and try everything\u201d.  With hardware to spare, SpaceX is not afraid to make wholesale changes between tests of its Starship rocket, relying on rapid iterations to advance the state of the art at an exhilarating pace. But this Yosemite Sam approach to testing won\u2019t work for Mars. It only takes a few hours for engineers to collect the data they need after a Starship launch, while test runs of Mars-bound systems will last for years.  The inevitable outcome is a development program that looks an awful lot like NASA, with long periods of fussing and analysis punctuated by infrequent, hideously expensive test flights. III. Autonomy Autonomy is a concept alien to NASA, which has been micromanaging astronauts from the ground since the first Mercury astronaut had to beg controllers for  permission to pee (the request went all the way up the reporting chain to Wernher Von Braun). To this day, missions follow a test pilot paradigm where the crew works from detailed checklists prepared for them months or years in advance.  On the space station, this takes the form of a graphical schedule creeping past a red vertical line on a laptop screen, with astronauts expected to keep pace with the moving colored boxes.  Most routine work on the space station (like pumping water or managing waste heat) is relegated to specialized teams on the ground and is not even visible to the crew. Alan Shepard aboard Freedom 7, explaining that he really has to go pretty bad. But as a Mars-bound spacecraft gets further from Earth, the round-trip communications delay with ground control will build to a maximum of 43 minutes, culminating in a week or more of communications blackout when the Sun is directly between the two planets.  This physical constraint means that  the crew has to have full control over every system on the spacecraft, without help from the ground. Autonomy sounds like a good thing! Who wants government bean-counters deciding how astronauts spend their space time? But the ground-driven paradigm has its advantages, most notably in limiting workload. The ISS is run by a staff of hundreds who together send some 50,000 commands per day to the station. The seven astronauts on board are only called in as a last resort, and even so the demands on their time are so great that the station has struggled to perform its scientific mission. [11] One benefit of NASA\u2019s backseat driving has always been that in an emergency, the crew has access to unlimited real-time expert help on Earth. The starkest illustration of this came on Apollo 13, when an oxygen tank in the service module ruptured 56 hours into the flight.  It took the crew and mission controllers nearly an hour to get their bearings, at which point there was only a short window of time left to power down the spacecraft in a way that would preserve their ability to return to Earth. A transcript of that first hour shows how difficult it was for crew and ground to figure out what was happening, and prioritize their response. It casts no aspersions on the crew of Apollo 13 to say they could not have survived a Mars-like communications delay. And while this mission is the most famous example of ground controllers backstopping an Apollo crew, there were at least five more occasions in the Apollo program when timely help from the ground averted serious trouble: Apollo 12 was hit twice by lightning after launch, scrambling the electrical system and lighting up the command module with warning lights. Flight controller John Aaron recognized the baffling error pattern and passed into NASA legend by telling the crew to flip an obscure switch that restored sanity to their displays. On Apollo 14, the descent radar on the lunar module failed to lock on properly, returning spurious range data. Without a timely call from ground control (who told the pilot to reset a breaker), the problem would likely have led to an aborted landing. On Apollo 15, the crew struggled to contain a water leak that threatened to become serious. After fifteen minutes, engineers on the ground were able to trace the problem to a pre-launch incident with a chlorination valve and relay up a procedure that solved the problem. Also on Apollo 15, a sliver of loose metal floating in a switch caused an intermittent abort signal to be sent to the lunar module engine.  Suppressing the signal so the lunar module could descend safely required reprogramming the onboard computer in a procedure guaranteed to raise the hairs on the head of every modern software developer. On Apollo 16, a pair of servo motors on the service module failed in lunar orbit. Mission rules called for an abort, but after some interactive debugging with the command module pilot, ground controllers found a workaround they judged safe enough to continue with the landing. While these incidents stand out, Apollo transcripts reveal numberless other examples of crew and ground working closely to get on top of problems. The loss of this real-time help is a real risk magnifier for astronauts going to Mars. IV. Analysis Another way in which the ISS depends on Earth is for laboratory analysis of air and water samples, which are collected on a regular schedule and sent down with each returning capsule. The tests that can be performed on the station itself are rudimentary, alerting crew to the presence of microbes or contaminants, but without the detailed information necessary to trace a root cause. For Mars, this analytic capability will have to move into the spacecraft. In essence, this means building a kind of Space Theranos, an automated black box that can perform biochemical assays in space without requiring repair or calibration. Such an instrument doesn\u2019t exist anywhere, but a Mars mission requires two flavors of it\u2014one that works in zero G, and another for Martian gravity. [12] This black box belongs to a category of hardware that pops up a lot in Mars plans: technologies that would be multibillion dollar industries if they  existed on Earth, but are assumed to be easy enough to invent when the time comes to put them on a Mars-bound spacecraft. [13] Some Mars boosters even cite these technologies as examples of the benefits going to Mars will bring to humanity.  But this gets things exactly backwards\u2014problems that are hard on Earth don\u2019t get easier by firing them into space, and the fact that nonexistent technologies are on the critical path to Mars is not an argument for going there. V. Automation The requirement that the crew be able to handle the ship when some members are incapacitated and there is no communication with Earth means that an ISS-size workload has to be automated to the point where it can be run by two or three astronauts. Astronaut Alexander Gerst (right) interacting with CIMON, NASA's $6 million AI chatbot Automation means software, and lots of it.  To automate the systems on a Mars-bound spacecraft will be a monumental task, like trying to extend the autopilot on an airliner to make it run the airport concession stands, baggage claim, and airline pension plan.  The likely outcome is an ISS-like hotchpotch of software tested to different levels of rigor, running across hundreds of processors. But this hardware will be exposed to a far harsher radiation environment than systems on the ISS, making software design and integration a particular challenge. A special case of the automation problem comes up on long-stay missions, when  the orbiting spacecraft has to keep itself free of mold, fungus, and space raccoons for the year and a half that the crew are on the Martian surface. Anyone who owns a vacation home knows that this problem\u2014called \u201cquiescence\u201d in the Mars literature\u2014is already hard to solve on Earth. Unless carefully managed, the interplay between automation, complexity and reliability can enter a pathological spiral.   Adding software to a system makes it more complex. To stay reliable, complex systems have to degrade gracefully, so that the whole continues to function even if an individual component fails. But these degraded modes, as well as unexpected interactions between them, introduce their own complexity, which then has to be managed with software, and so on. The upshot is that automation introduces its own, separate reason for running full-length mock missions before actually going to Mars. There will be too many bugs in a system this complex to leave them all for the first Mars-bound crew to discover. Implications The extreme requirements for autonomy, reliability, and automation I\u2019ve outlined are old news to designers of deep-space probes. The solar system is full of hardware beeping serenely away decades after launch, most spectacularly the forty-six-year-old Voyager spacecraft. But  no one has ever tried attaching a box of large primates to a deep space probe with the goal of keeping them alive, happy, and not tweeting about how NASA sent them into the vast empty spaces to die.  A Mars-bound spacecraft will be the most complicated human artifact ever built, about a hundred times bigger than any previous space probe, and inside it will be a tightly-coupled system of software, hardware, bacteria, fungi, astronauts, and (for half the mission) whatever stuff the crew tracks with them back onto the spacecraft. Designing such a machine means taking something at the ragged edge of human ability (building interplanetary probes) and combining it with something that we can\u2019t even do yet on Earth (keep a group of six or eight humans alive for years with regenerative life support). [14] My argument is not that it is impossible to do this, but that it is impossible to do it quickly.  Preparing for Mars will be an iterative, open-ended undertaking in which every round of testing eats up years of time and most of our space budget, like Artemis and the ISS before it.  The first decade of a Mars program will be indistinguishable from the last forty years of space flight\u2014a series of repetitive, long-duration missions to orbit. The only thing NASA will need to change is the program name. Nor is this a problem that can be delegated to billionaire hobbyists. Life support is going to be a grind no matter whose logo is on the rocket.  The sky could be thick with Starships and we\u2019d still be stuck doing all-up trials of hardware and software on these multi-year missions to nowhere. The only way to explore Mars in our lifetime is to ditch the requirement that people accompany the machinery. Choosing a profile But since we\u2019re determined to go to Mars, and have two profiles to choose from, which one is better? Everyone agrees that only the long-stay profile makes sense for exploration. There\u2019s no point in spending 95% of the trip in transit just to get a rushed couple of weeks at the destination. But on early missions, where the goal is just to get the crew home alive, the choice is tricky. Long Stay The virtue of the long stay profile is simplicity. You fly your rocket to Mars, wait 17 months for the planets to align, and then fly the same trajectory home.  Each leg of this transfer journey lasts about as long as an ISS deployment, and it\u2019s possible to tweak the transfer time by burning more fuel (although the crew then has to stay longer on Mars to compensate). At every point in the mission, the ship remains between 1 AU and 1.5 AU from the Sun. This simplifies thermal and solar panel design and greatly reduces the risk to the crew from solar storms. But the problem of what to do with all that time on Mars is vexing.  500 days is a long time for a first stay anywhere, even someplace with nightlife and an atmosphere.   And as we\u2019ll see, an orbital mission is probably out of the question.  The requirement that the crew go live on Mars on their first visit adds enormously to the level of risk. Short Stay The appeal of the short stay profile is right in the name. Instead of staying on Mars so long they have to file taxes, the first arrivals can plant the flag, grab whatever rock is nearest the ladder, and get the hell out of there.  Or they can choose to skip the landing and make the first trip strictly orbital, following a tradition in aerospace engineering of attempting the impossible sequentially instead of all at once. But the problem with the short stay profile is that trip home. The return trajectory cuts well inside the orbit of Venus, complicating the design of the spacecraft and adding spectacular ways for the crew to die during the weeks near perihelion. For most of that journey, the ship is on the wrong side of the Sun, hampering communications with Earth while leaving the crew with no warning of solar storms. And that crew has to spend two consecutive years in deep space, maximizing their exposure to radiation and microgravity, the biggest known risks to astronaut health. The short stay profile also requires more propellant, in some years a prohibitive amount. If your strategy for mitigating risk on Mars is to launch crews during every synodic period, so that there are always potential rescuers en route to Mars, then this is a problem.  \n\ufffc A diagram comparing the delta-v requirements for short stay and long stay missions across future launch dates. Since propellant requirements go up exponentially with delta v, a mission in 2041 requires five times as much propellant as one in 2033. source \u201c Orbit or Land? Once you\u2019ve picked a profile, the other decision to make is whether to land the spacecraft. Obviously you have to land a crew at some point; if you don\u2019t, the other space programs will make fun of you, and there will be hurtful zingers at your Congressional hearing. But since surviving a trip to Mars requires tackling a sequence of unrelated problems (arrival, entry, landing, surface operations, ascent, rendezvous), there is a case for cutting the problem in half by making the first mission orbital. This was the approach taken by the Apollo program, which looped the first crew around the Moon before a working lunar lander existed. Not having to carry a lander on the first mission means more room for spare parts and consumables, which improves the margin of safety for the crew.  It also buys time for engineers to work on the hard problems of entry, landing, quiescence, and ascent without holding back the entire program. But there are powerful arguments against an orbital mission. Since so much of the risk in going to Mars is a simple function of time, why roll the dice more than necessary? And given the expense and physical toll on crew,  how do you justify not attempting a landing?  Imagine driving to Disneyland, turning the car around in the parking lot, and announcing to your family that you\u2019re now ready for the real trip next year.  There will be angry kicking from the backseat, and mutiny. NASA has waffled for years over which option to choose.  In the 2009 design reference architecture, they favored sending a crew of four on the long stay trajectory.  Their more recent plans envision a shoestring mission on a short-stay profile with four crew members, two of whom attempt a landing. Elon Musk, for his part, has proposed solving the problem in stages, sending volunteers to settle Mars first, then figuring out how to get them home later. [15] What makes the choice genuinely hard is that we lack answers to two key questions: 1. How does the human body respond to partial gravity? Decades in space have given us a good idea of what prolonged periods in free-fall do to astronauts, and how they recover after returning to Earth.   But we have no idea what happens in partial gravity, either on the Moon (0.16 g) or on Mars (0.38 g). In particular, we don\u2019t know whether Martian gravity is strong enough to arrest or slow the degenerative processes that we observe in free fall. [16] The answer to this question will drive a key decision: whether or not to spin the spacecraft. As we\u2019ll see, spinning a spacecraft to create artificial gravity is an enormous hassle, but whether it\u2019s avoidable depends on the unstudied effects of long stays in partial gravity. [17] 2. What is the risk to the crew from the heavy-ion component of galactic cosmic radiation? Radiation in space comes in many varieties, most of which are well-understood from experience with their analogues on Earth. Low-dose heavy-ion radiation, however, is different.  It doesn\u2019t exist outside of particle accelerators on Earth and is hard to study in low orbit, where both the magnetosphere and the bulk of our planet shield astronauts from most of the flux they\u2019d experience in free space. Heavy ion radiation has biological effects that are not captured by the standard model of radiation damage to tissue. In particular, there is a class of phenomena called non-targeted effects (NTEs) that are known to damage cells far from the radiation track. This is a weird effect, like if found yourself hospitalized because your neighbor got hit by a car.  It\u2019s believed that NTEs disrupt epigenetic signaling mechanisms in cells, but the phenomenon is poorly understood. Uncertainty about the effects of low-dose heavy ion radiation widens our best guess at radiation risk by at least a factor of two. [18] At the low end of the range, these effects are just a curiosity, and Mars missions can be planned using traditional models of radiation exposure. At the high end of the range, long-duration orbital missions may not be survivable, and astronauts on the Martian surface will either have to live in a cave or cover their shelter with meters of soil. Prediction of tumor prevalence after 1 year of galactic cosmic radiation exposure. The solid line at bottom shows the standard radiation model (TE). The dotted lines show the influence of non-targeted effects (NTE) under different assumptions. Note the nearly threefold uncertainty in predicted tumor prevalence in the unshielded case. source This uncertainty about biological effects makes radiation the greatest uncharacterized known risk facing a Mars-bound crew, and it affects every aspect of mission design. It\u2019s helpful to combine the three main risk factors in going to Mars into one big chart:\n\n\ufffc Technical Risk Orbit Land Short Stay Spacecraft trajectory complicates spacecraft design, communications are a challenge. Requires working lander and ascent stage, less margin than orbital mission. Long Stay Lowest complexity, large mass budget for spares and consumables. Highest complexity, all-up mission must work on the first try. Radiation Risk Orbit Land Short Stay 600 days in deep space, return trip requires close solar approach (0.7 AU).  Risk from solar particle events may require flying near solar minimum, incurring higher GCR dose. Long Stay Risk of death or incapacitation from heavy ion component of GCR may exceed 50% Lowest radiation exposure, but adequately shielding the habitat on Mars increases complexity and contamination risk Deconditioning Risk Orbit Land Short Stay 1.5 times beyond human endurance record; crew at risk for bone fractures and eye damage. Long Stay 2.5 times beyond human endurance record. Physiological effects of partial gravity unknown. The gray areas in these grids represent knowledge gaps that have to be filled before we decide how to go to Mars. How long this preliminary medical research would take is anyone\u2019s guess, but it has to be some multiple of the total mission time.  Studying partial gravity in particular is tricky\u2014you can do it on the Moon (42% of martian gravity) and hope the results extend to Mars, or you can build rotating structures in space and do more precise tests there. Studying radiation effects means flying animals outside the magnetosphere for a few years and then watching them for tumors, which (unless the radiation news is really bad) is also going to take some time. In software engineering we have a useful concept called \u201cyak shaving\u201d. To get started on a project you must first prepare your tools, which often involves reconfiguring your programming environment, which may mean updating software, which requires finding a long-disused password, and pretty soon you find yourself under the office chair with a hex wrench. (The TV show Malcolm in the Middle has a beautiful illustration of yak shaving in the context of home repair.) The same phenomenon afflicts us in trying to go to Mars. It would be one thing if, given enough rockets and money, explorers could climb on a spaceship and go. But there is always this chain of necessary prerequisites. We paint Destination: Mars! on the side of our spaceship and then find ourselves in low Earth orbit a decade later, centrifuging mice. It\u2019s dispiriting. It\u2019s tempting to say \u201cyou can just build things\u201d and dismiss all this research and testing as timid and unnecessary. But this would mean ignoring the biggest risk factor for Mars, which I\u2019ll include here for the sake of completeness. Unknown Risks Orbit Land Short Stay Unknown Unknown Long Stay Unknown Unknown A trip to Mars is so difficult that we don\u2019t have the luxury of ignoring known risks\u2014we need all the room we can spare in our risk budget for the things we don\u2019t know to worry about yet. My goal in all this is not to kill a cherished dream, but to try to push people to a more realistic view of what it means to commit to a Mars landing, and in particular to think about going to Mars in terms of opportunity costs. In recent years, there\u2019s been a remarkable division in space exploration.  On one side of the divide are missions like Curiosity, James Webb, Gaia, or Euclid that are making new discoveries by the day. These projects have clearly defined goals and a formidable record of discovery. On the other side, there is the International Space Station and the now twenty-year old effort to return Americans to the moon. These projects have no purpose other than perpetuating a human presence in space, and they eat through half the country\u2019s space budget with nothing to show for it.  Forget even Mars\u2014we are further from landing on the Moon today than we were in 1965. In going to Mars, we have a choice about which side of this ledger to be on. We can go aggressively explore the planet with robots, benefiting from an ongoing revolution in automation and software to launch ever more capable missions to the places most likely to harbor life. Or we can stay on the treadmill we\u2019ve been on for forty years,  slowly building up the capacity to land human beings on the safest possible piece of Martian real estate, where they will leave behind a plaque and a flag.  But we can\u2019t do both. Next time: Eyes and Bones Footnotes [1] Quote taken from a 2000 oral history with Aaron. [2] For an early example, see the 1928 Scientific American article, \u201c Can we go to Mars? \u201d, While understandably hand-wavy about the means of propulsion, it describes a conjunction-class orbital mission not substantially different from NASA\u2019s 2009 Design Reference Architecture. [3] Valerii Polyakov set the 437 day record on a space flight that landed in 1995. The International Space Station went without resupply from Nov 25, 2002 to April 2, 2003. Nine Apollo missions went beyond low Earth orbit, the longest of these (Apollo 17) was gone 12.4 days. [4] The Saturn V was capable of launching about 20 tons on a Mars flyby trajectory. NASA undertook preliminary planning for such a mission (requiring four Saturn V launches) in 1967. [5] In 1987 a team chaired by Sally Ride proposed a \u2018split/sprint\u2019 mission architecture that is probably the best way to get to Mars. In this architecture, slow-moving tankers pre-position cryogenic propellant depots in Mars orbit, and then in the next synodic period a human mission (the \u201csprint\u201d part of the mission) lands briefly on Mars, refuels from the orbiting depots, and get home within 400 days.  Such a mission requires about 15 heavy launches and two nonexistent technologies: long-term storage of liquid hydrogen in space, and the ability to pump liquid hydrogen between spacecraft in space.  (Interestingly, both of these technologies are part of Blue Origin's plan to build a moon lander). The other way to get to Mars fast is with nuclear thermal rockets. A nuclear thermal rocket is just a nuclear reactor that shoots hot hydrogen out one end. Nuclear thermal rocket designs are about twice as efficient as chemical rockets, making it feasible to fly missions with higher delta V requirements. [6] For a comprehensive discussion of Apollo abort modes, see 1972 Apollo Experience Report - Abort Planning . [7] You can read about possible Mars abort modes in Earth to mars Abort Analysis for Human Mars Missions . What kind of a failure scenario would even benefit from a two-year abort option is an interesting philosophical question. [8] I wrote a little python script if you want to play with these scenarios yourself. [9] Life support equipment on ISS is packaged into components called \u2018Orbital Replacement Units\u2019. In some cases, this means that an assembly weighing hundreds of kilograms has to be flown up because a tiny sensor within it failed. Here's a partial list of ORUs replaced in calendar year 2023 ( source ): Heat exchanger in Node 3 Common cabin air assembly water separator Node 3 water separator Common cabin air assembly water separator liquid check valve 21 charcoal filters stationwide HEPA filters in Node 3 Blower in carbon dioxide removal assembly (twice, first replacement failed) Sample Distribution Assembly in Node 3 Mass Spectrometer assembly Multifiltration bed Pump in oxygen generation assembly [10] An early urine reprocessor on the space station failed after it got clogged up by calcium crystals from the astronauts' dissolving bones, an effect of weightlessness that wasn't properly accounted for in the design. [11] The 50,000 command figure is from The ISS: Operating an Outpost in the New Frontier , a detailed primer on space station operations. ISS utilization has gone up in recent years, but still remains below 80 hours/week\u2014two full-time equivalents. The seven-member crew spends most of their waking time on mandatory exercise, housekeeping, and station repair. [12] Existing instruments in space are usually set up to identify chemicals on a target list of 10-20 substances, a much easier task than identifying arbitrary compounds. For the state of the art on the latter, see Progress on the Organic and Inorganic Modules of the Spacecraft Water Impurity Monitor, a Next Generation Complete Water Analysis System for Crewed Vehicles (ICES-2023-110). [13] Other examples of magic Mars technology include leakless seals for spacesuits, waterless washing machines, biofilm-proof coatings, nutritionally complete meals that can be stored for years at room temperature, and autonomous solar-powered factories for turning CO2 into hundreds of tons of methane. [14] The endurance record for closed-system life support belongs to Biosphere 2, which kept a crew alive for 17 months before oxygen fell to dangerous levels because of unanticipated interactions with building materials. [15] Plans involving Starship and Mars depend on being able to produce hundreds of tons of propellant on the Martian surface so the rockets can launch again. In the absence of any details from Musk or SpaceX, the closest thing we have to a detailed plan is this analysis in Nature . [16] For all we know, the set of problems collectively called \"deconditioning\" could get worse in partial gravity. This goes against our intuitions, but there have been bigger surprises in space. [17] Another decision that hinges on the effects of partial gravity is whether or not to include heavy exercise equipment on the Mars surface habitat, where space and mass are at a premium.",

The good news is that these constraints are so strong that we can say a lot about going to Mars without committing to any particular spacecraft or mission design.  Just like animals that live in the sea are likely to have good hearing and a streamlined body shape, there are things that have to hold true for any Mars-bound spacecraft, just from the nature of the problem.\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n<h2>I. No escape, no rescue</h2>\n\n<p>A trip to Mars will be commital in a way that has no precedent in human space flight.  The moon landings were designed so that any moment the crew could hit the red button and return expeditiously to Earth; engineers spent the brief windows of time when an abort was infeasible chain smoking and chewing on their slide rules. <a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#apollo_abort\" name=\"fn_apollo_abort\"><sup>[6]</sup></a>\n\n<p>But within a few days of launch, a Mars-bound crew will have committed to spending years in space with no hope of resupply or rescue.  If something goes wrong, the only alternative to completing the mission will be to divert into a long, looping orbit that gets the spacecraft home about two years after departure.<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#mars_abort\" name=\"fn_mars_abort\"><sup>[7]</sup></a>   And if they get stuck on Mars, astronauts will find themselves in a similar position to the early Antarctic explorers, able to communicate home by radio, but forced by unalterable cycles of nature to wait months or years for a rescue ship. \n\n<p><img src=\"https://idlewords.com/images/mars_abort_types.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\" />\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Delta-v in km/sec required to return to Earth in 50, 70, and 90 days from various points in a long-stay Mars mission.

You can think of flying to Mars like one of those art films where the director has to shoot the movie in a single take. Even if no scene is especially challenging, the requirement that everything go right sequentially, with no way to pause or reshoot, means that even small risks become unacceptable in the aggregate. \n\n<p>To get a feel for this effect, consider a toy model where we fly to Mars on a 30 month mission.  Every month there is a 3% chance that a critical system on our spacecraft will fail, and once that happens, the spacecraft enters a degraded state, with a 5% chance every month that a subsequent failure kills the crew. \n\n<p>In this model,  the probability that the crew gets home safely works out to 68%.  But if we add an abort option that can get them home in six months, that probability jumps to 85%.  And with a three month abort trajectory, the odds of safe return go up to 92%. \n\n<p>These odds are notional, but they demonstrate how big an effect the absence of abort options can have on safety.<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#abort_code\" name=\"fn_abort_code\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> \n\n<p>This necessary risk aversion introduces a tension into any Mars program. What\u2019s the point of spending a trillion dollars to send a crew if they\u2019re going to cower inside their spacecraft?  And yet since going outside is one of the most dangerous things you can do on Mars, early missions have to minimize it. The first visitors to Mars will have to land in the safest possible location and do almost nothing. \n\n\n<p>Risk is closely tied with the next issue, reliability.\n\n\n\n<h2>II. Reliability</h2> \n\n<p>The closest thing humanity has built to a Mars-bound spacecraft is the International Space Station.  But \u2018reliable\u2019 is not the first word that leaps to the lips of ISS engineers when they talk about their creation\u2014not even the first printable word. Despite twenty years of effort, equipment on the station breaks constantly, and depends on a stream of replacement parts flown up from Earth.<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#iss_failures\" name=\"fn_iss_failures\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://idlewords.com/images/heat_exchanger.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px;\" />\n\n<p class=\"caption\">A defective heat exchanger packaged for return to Earth from ISS in 2023</p>\n\n<p>Going to Mars will require order of magnitude reliability improvements over the status quo. Systems on the spacecraft will need to work without breaking, or at least break in ways the crew can fix.  If there\u2019s an emergency, like a chemical leak or a fire, the crew must be able to live for years in whatever\u2019s left of the ship.  And the kind of glitches that made for funny stories in low Earth orbit (like a <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/urine_icicle.htm\">urine icicle blocking the Space Shuttle toilet</a>) will be enough to kill a Mars-bound crew.\n\n<p>Complicating matters is that traditional reliability engineering practices don\u2019t work in life support, where everything is interconnected, often through the bodies of the crew.  Life support engineering is much more like keeping a marine aquarium than it is like building a rocket. It\u2019s not easy to untangle cause from effect, the entire system evolves over time, and there\u2019s a lot of \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d between subsystems that were supposed to be unrelated.<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#urine_calcium\" name=\"fn_urine_calcium\"><sup>[10]</sup></a>  Indeed, failures in life support have a tendency to wander the spacecraft until they find the most irreplaceable thing to break.\n\n<p>Nor is it possible to brute-force things by filling the spacecraft with spare parts. The same systemic interactions that damage one component can eat through any number of replacements. The bedrock axiom of reliability engineering\u2014that complex designs can be partitioned into isolated subsystems with independent failure rates\u2014does not hold for regenerative life support.\n\n<p>The need for long and expensive test flights to validate life support introduces another kind of risk aversion, this time in the design phase.  With prototypes needing to be flown for years in space, there will be pressure to freeze the life support design at whatever point it becomes barely adequate, and no amount of later innovation will make it onto the spacecraft.  \n\n<p>This is a similar dynamic to one that afflicted the Space Shuttle, a groundbreaking initial design so expensive to modify that it froze the underlying technology at the prototype phase for thirty years.  In that period we learned nothing about making better space planes, but burned through decades and billions of dollars patching up the first working prototype.\n \n<p>Such timorousness goes against the grain of a development strategy that proven spectacularly successful in recent years for SpaceX, an approach you could call \u201cfly often and try everything\u201d.  With hardware to spare, SpaceX is not afraid to make wholesale changes between tests of its Starship rocket, relying on rapid iterations to advance the state of the art at an exhilarating pace.\n\n<p>But this Yosemite Sam approach to testing won\u2019t work for Mars. It only takes a few hours for engineers to collect the data they need after a Starship launch, while test runs of Mars-bound systems will last for years.  The inevitable outcome is a development program that looks an awful lot like NASA, with long periods of fussing and analysis punctuated by infrequent, hideously expensive test flights. \n\n<h2>III. Autonomy</h2>\n\n<p>Autonomy is a concept alien to NASA, which has been micromanaging astronauts from the ground since the first Mercury astronaut had to <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/shepard_pee.htm\">beg controllers for  permission to pee</a> (the request went all the way up the reporting chain to Wernher Von Braun).  \n\n<p>To this day, missions follow a test pilot paradigm where the crew works from detailed checklists prepared for them months or years in advance.  On the space station, this takes the form of a graphical schedule creeping past a red vertical line on a laptop screen, with astronauts expected to keep pace with the moving colored boxes.  Most routine work on the space station (like pumping water or managing waste heat) is relegated to specialized teams on the ground and is not even visible to the crew. \n\n<p><img src=\"https://idlewords.com/images/shepard_in_space.jpg\" width=\"600\" />\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Alan Shepard aboard Freedom 7, explaining that he really has to go pretty bad.</p> \n\n<p>But as a Mars-bound spacecraft gets further from Earth, the round-trip communications delay with ground control will build to a maximum of 43 minutes, culminating in a week or more of communications blackout when the Sun is directly between the two planets.  This physical constraint means that  the crew has to have full control over every system on the spacecraft, without help from the ground.\n\n<p>Autonomy sounds like a good thing! Who wants government bean-counters deciding how astronauts spend their space time? But the ground-driven paradigm has its advantages, most notably in limiting workload. The ISS is run by a staff of hundreds who together send some 50,000 commands per day to the station. The seven astronauts on board are only called in as a last resort, and even so the demands on their time are so great that the station has struggled to perform its scientific mission.<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#iss_workload\" name=\"fn_iss_workload\"><sup>[11]</sup></a>\n\n<p>One benefit of NASA\u2019s backseat driving has always been that in an emergency, the crew has access to unlimited real-time expert help on Earth. The starkest illustration of this came on Apollo 13, when an oxygen tank in the service module ruptured 56 hours into the flight.  It took the crew and mission controllers nearly an hour to get their bearings, at which point there was only a short window of time left to power down the spacecraft in a way that would preserve their ability to return to Earth.  \n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/apollo_13_annotated.htm\">transcript of that first hour</a> shows how difficult it was for crew and ground to figure out what was happening, and prioritize their response. It casts no aspersions on the crew of Apollo 13 to say they could not have survived a Mars-like communications delay.  \n\n<p>And while this mission is the most famous example of ground controllers backstopping an Apollo crew, there were at least five more occasions in the Apollo program when timely help from the ground averted serious trouble:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apollo 12 was hit twice by lightning after launch, scrambling the electrical system and lighting up the command module with warning lights. Flight controller John Aaron recognized the baffling error pattern and passed into NASA legend by telling the crew to flip an obscure switch that restored sanity to their displays.</li> \n\n<li>On Apollo 14, the descent radar on the lunar module failed to lock on properly, returning spurious range data. Without a timely call from ground control (who told the pilot to reset a breaker), the problem would likely have led to an aborted landing. </li>\n\n<li>On Apollo 15, the crew struggled to contain a water leak that threatened to become serious. After fifteen minutes, engineers on the ground were able to trace the problem to a pre-launch incident with a chlorination valve and relay up a procedure that solved the problem.</li>\n\n<li>Also on Apollo 15, a sliver of loose metal floating in a switch caused an intermittent abort signal to be sent to the lunar module engine.  Suppressing the signal so the lunar module could descend safely required reprogramming the onboard computer in a procedure guaranteed to raise the hairs on the head of every modern software developer.</li>\n\n<li>On Apollo 16, a pair of servo motors on the service module failed in lunar orbit. Mission rules called for an abort, but after some interactive debugging with the command module pilot, ground controllers found a workaround they judged safe enough to continue with the landing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While these incidents stand out, Apollo transcripts reveal numberless other examples of crew and ground working closely to get on top of problems. The loss of this real-time help is a real risk magnifier for astronauts going to Mars. \n\n<h2>IV. Analysis</h2>\n\n<p>Another way in which the ISS depends on Earth is for laboratory analysis of air and water samples, which are collected on a regular schedule and sent down with each returning capsule. The tests that can be performed on the station itself are rudimentary, alerting crew to the presence of microbes or contaminants, but without the detailed information necessary to trace a root cause.\n\n<p>For Mars, this analytic capability will have to move into the spacecraft. In essence, this means building a kind of Space Theranos, an automated black box that can perform biochemical assays in space without requiring repair or calibration. Such an instrument doesn\u2019t exist anywhere, but a Mars mission requires two flavors of it\u2014one that works in zero G, and another for Martian gravity.<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#theranos\" name=\"fn_theranos\"><sup>[12]</sup></a> \n\n<p>This black box belongs to a category of hardware that pops up a lot in Mars plans: technologies that would be multibillion dollar industries if they  existed on Earth, but are assumed to be easy enough to invent when the time comes to put them on a Mars-bound spacecraft.  <a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#magic_tech\" name=\"fn_magic_tech\"><sup>[13]</sup></a>\n\n<p>Some Mars boosters even cite these technologies as examples of the benefits going to Mars will bring to humanity.  But this gets things exactly backwards\u2014problems that are hard on Earth don\u2019t get easier by firing them into space, and the fact that nonexistent technologies are on the critical path to Mars is not an argument for going there.\n\n<h2>V. Automation </h2>\n\n<p>The requirement that the crew be able to handle the ship when some members are incapacitated and there is no communication with Earth means that an ISS-size workload has to be automated to the point where it can be run by two or three astronauts. \n\n<p><img src=\"https://idlewords.com/images/cimon_gerst.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px;\" />\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Astronaut Alexander Gerst (right) interacting with CIMON, NASA's $6 million AI chatbot</p>\n\n<p>Automation means software, and lots of it.  To automate the systems on a Mars-bound spacecraft will be a monumental task, like trying to extend the autopilot on an airliner to make it run the airport concession stands, baggage claim, and airline pension plan.  The likely outcome is an ISS-like hotchpotch of software tested to different levels of rigor, running across hundreds of processors. But this hardware will be exposed to a far harsher radiation environment than systems on the ISS, making software design and integration a particular challenge.\n\n<p>A special case of the automation problem comes up on long-stay missions, when  the orbiting spacecraft has to keep itself free of mold, fungus, and space raccoons for the year and a half that the crew are on the Martian surface. Anyone who owns a vacation home knows that this problem\u2014called \u201cquiescence\u201d in the Mars literature\u2014is already hard to solve on Earth. \n\n<p>Unless carefully managed, the interplay between automation, complexity and reliability can enter a pathological spiral.   Adding software to a system makes it more complex. To stay reliable, complex systems have to degrade gracefully, so that the whole continues to function even if an individual component fails. But these degraded modes, as well as unexpected interactions between them, introduce their own complexity, which then has to be managed with software, and so on. \n\n<p>The upshot is that automation introduces its own, separate reason for running full-length mock missions before actually going to Mars. There will be too many bugs in a system this complex to leave them all for the first Mars-bound crew to discover.\n\n<h2>Implications </h2>\n\n<p>The extreme requirements for autonomy, reliability, and automation I\u2019ve outlined are old news to designers of deep-space probes. The solar system is full of hardware beeping serenely away decades after launch, most spectacularly the forty-six-year-old Voyager spacecraft. \n\n<p>But  no one has ever tried attaching a box of large primates to a deep space probe with the goal of keeping them alive, happy, and not tweeting about how NASA sent them into the vast empty spaces to die.  A Mars-bound spacecraft will be the most complicated human artifact ever built, about a hundred times bigger than any previous space probe, and inside it will be a tightly-coupled system of software, hardware, bacteria, fungi, astronauts, and (for half the mission) whatever stuff the crew tracks with them back onto the spacecraft.\n\n<p>Designing such a machine means taking something at the ragged edge of human ability (building interplanetary probes) and combining it with something that we can\u2019t even do yet on Earth (keep a group of six or eight humans alive for years with regenerative life support).<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#biosphere2\" name=\"fn_biosphere2\"><sup>[14]</sup></a>  \n\n<p>My argument is not that it is impossible to do this, but that it is impossible to do it quickly.  Preparing for Mars will be an iterative, open-ended undertaking in which every round of testing eats up years of time and most of our space budget, like Artemis and the ISS before it.  The first decade of a Mars program will be indistinguishable from the last forty years of space flight\u2014a series of repetitive, long-duration missions to orbit. The only thing NASA will need to change is the program name. \n\n<p>Nor is this a problem that can be delegated to billionaire hobbyists. Life support is going to be a grind no matter whose logo is on the rocket.  The sky could be thick with Starships and we\u2019d still be stuck doing all-up trials of hardware and software on these multi-year missions to nowhere.  \n\n<p>The only way to explore Mars in our lifetime is to ditch the requirement that people accompany the machinery.\n\n<h2>Choosing a profile</h2> \n\n<p>But since we\u2019re determined to go to Mars, and have two profiles to choose from, which one is better? \n\n<p>Everyone agrees that only the long-stay profile makes sense for exploration. There\u2019s no point in spending 95% of the trip in transit just to get a rushed couple of weeks at the destination. \n\n<p>But on early missions, where the goal is just to get the crew home alive, the choice is tricky.\n\n<p><img src=\"https://idlewords.com/images/long_stay.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\" />\n\n\n<h2>Long Stay</h2>\n\n<p>The virtue of the long stay profile is simplicity. You fly your rocket to Mars, wait 17 months for the planets to align, and then fly the same trajectory home.  Each leg of this transfer journey lasts about as long as an ISS deployment, and it\u2019s possible to tweak the transfer time by burning more fuel (although the crew then has to stay longer on Mars to compensate). \n\n<p>At every point in the mission, the ship remains between 1 AU and 1.5 AU from the Sun. This simplifies thermal and solar panel design and greatly reduces the risk to the crew from solar storms.  \n\n<p>But the problem of what to do with all that time on Mars is vexing.  500 days is a long time for a first stay anywhere, even someplace with nightlife and an atmosphere.   And as we\u2019ll see, an orbital mission is probably out of the question.  The requirement that the crew go live on Mars on their first visit adds enormously to the level of risk. \n\n<p><img src=\"https://idlewords.com/images/short_stay.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\" />\n\n<h2>Short Stay</h2>\n\n<p>The appeal of the short stay profile is right in the name. Instead of staying on Mars so long they have to file taxes, the first arrivals can plant the flag, grab whatever rock is nearest the ladder, and get the hell out of there.  Or they can choose to skip the landing and make the first trip strictly orbital, following a tradition in aerospace engineering of attempting the impossible sequentially instead of all at once.\n\n<p>But the problem with the short stay profile is that trip home. The return trajectory cuts well inside the orbit of Venus, complicating the design of the spacecraft and adding spectacular ways for the crew to die during the weeks near perihelion. For most of that journey, the ship is on the wrong side of the Sun, hampering communications with Earth while leaving the crew with no warning of solar storms.\n\n<p>And that crew has to spend two consecutive years in deep space, maximizing their exposure to radiation and microgravity, the biggest known risks to astronaut health. \n\n<p>The short stay profile also requires more propellant, in some years a prohibitive amount. If your strategy for mitigating risk on Mars is to launch crews during every synodic period, so that there are always potential rescuers en route to Mars, then this is a problem.  \n\ufffc\n<p><img src=\"https://idlewords.com/images/delta_v_graph.png\" width=\"600\" />\n\n<p class=\"caption\">A diagram comparing the delta-v requirements for short stay and long stay missions across future launch dates. Since propellant requirements go up exponentially with delta v, a mission in 2041 requires five times as much propellant as one in 2033. <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20130010385/downloads/20130010385.pdf\">source</a>\u201c\n</p>\n\n<h2>Orbit or Land?</h2> \n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve picked a profile, the other decision to make is whether to land the spacecraft. \n\n<p>Obviously you have to land a crew at some point; if you don\u2019t, the other space programs will make fun of you, and there will be hurtful zingers at your Congressional hearing. \n\n<p>But since surviving a trip to Mars requires tackling a sequence of unrelated problems (arrival, entry, landing, surface operations, ascent, rendezvous), there is a case for cutting the problem in half by making the first mission orbital. This was the approach taken by the Apollo program, which looped the first crew around the Moon before a working lunar lander existed.\n\n<p>Not having to carry a lander on the first mission means more room for spare parts and consumables, which improves the margin of safety for the crew.  It also buys time for engineers to work on the hard problems of entry, landing, quiescence, and ascent without holding back the entire program. \n\n<p>But there are powerful arguments against an orbital mission. Since so much of the risk in going to Mars is a simple function of time, why roll the dice more than necessary? And given the expense and physical toll on crew,  how do you justify not attempting a landing?  Imagine driving to Disneyland, turning the car around in the parking lot, and announcing to your family that you\u2019re now ready for the real trip next year.  There will be angry kicking from the backseat, and mutiny.  \n \n<p>NASA has waffled for years over which option to choose.  In the 2009 design reference architecture, they favored sending a crew of four on the long stay trajectory.  Their more recent plans envision a shoestring mission on a short-stay profile with four crew members, two of whom attempt a landing. \n\n<p>Elon Musk, for his part, has proposed solving the problem in stages, sending volunteers to settle Mars first, then figuring out how to get them home later.<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#spacex_plan\" name=\"fn_spacex_plan\"><sup>[15]</sup></a>   \n\n<p>What makes the choice genuinely hard is that we lack answers to two key questions:\n\n<p><b>1. How does the human body respond to partial gravity?</b>\n\n<p>Decades in space have given us a good idea of what prolonged periods in free-fall do to astronauts, and how they recover after returning to Earth.   But we have no idea what happens in partial gravity, either on the Moon (0.16 g) or on Mars (0.38 g). In particular, we don\u2019t know whether Martian gravity is strong enough to arrest or slow the degenerative processes that we observe in free fall.<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#deconditioning\" name=\"fn_deconditioning\"><sup>[16]</sup></a>  \n\n<p>The answer to this question will drive a key decision: whether or not to spin the spacecraft. As we\u2019ll see, spinning a spacecraft to create artificial gravity is an enormous hassle, but whether it\u2019s avoidable depends on the unstudied effects of long stays in partial gravity.<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#partial_g\" name=\"fn_partial_g\"><sup>[17]</sup></a> \n\n<p><b>2. What is the risk to the crew from the heavy-ion component of galactic cosmic radiation?</b>\n\n<p>Radiation in space comes in many varieties, most of which are well-understood from experience with their analogues on Earth.  \n\n<p>Low-dose heavy-ion radiation, however, is different.  It doesn\u2019t exist outside of particle accelerators on Earth and is hard to study in low orbit, where both the magnetosphere and the bulk of our planet shield astronauts from most of the flux they\u2019d experience in free space.  \n\n<p>Heavy ion radiation has biological effects that are not captured by the standard model of radiation damage to tissue. In particular, there is a class of phenomena called non-targeted effects (NTEs) that are known to damage cells far from the radiation track. This is a weird effect, like if found yourself hospitalized because your neighbor got hit by a car.  It\u2019s believed that NTEs disrupt epigenetic signaling mechanisms in cells, but the phenomenon is poorly understood.\n\n<p>Uncertainty about the effects of low-dose heavy ion radiation widens our best guess at radiation risk by at least a factor of two.<a class=\"fnote\" href=\"#radiation_uncertainty\"><sup>[18]</sup></a> At the low end of the range, these effects are just a curiosity, and Mars missions can be planned using traditional models of radiation exposure. At the high end of the range, long-duration orbital missions may not be survivable, and astronauts on the Martian surface will either have to live in a cave or cover their shelter with meters of soil.\n\n<p><img src=\"https://idlewords.com/images/nte_uncertainty.png\" width=\"600\" />\n\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Prediction of tumor prevalence after 1 year of galactic cosmic radiation exposure. The solid line at bottom shows the standard radiation model (TE). The dotted lines show the influence of non-targeted effects (NTE) under different assumptions. Note the nearly threefold uncertainty in predicted tumor prevalence in the unshielded case. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28500351/\">source</a>\n\n<p>This uncertainty about biological effects makes radiation the greatest uncharacterized known risk facing a Mars-bound crew, and it affects every aspect of mission design. \n\n<p>It\u2019s helpful to combine the three main risk factors in going to Mars into one big chart:\n\n\ufffc\n<table class=\"risk\" style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"500\">\n<caption>Technical Risk</caption>\n\n<tr><th></th><th width=\"210\">Orbit</th><th>Land</th></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;\" width=\"80\">Short Stay</td>\n<td class=\"mid\">Spacecraft trajectory complicates spacecraft design, communications are a challenge.</td>\n<td class=\"high\">Requires working lander and ascent stage, less margin than orbital mission.\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;\">Long Stay</td>\n<td class=\"low\">Lowest complexity, large mass budget for spares and consumables. </td>\n<td class=\"vhigh\">Highest complexity, all-up mission must work on the first try.</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<table class=\"risk\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<caption>Radiation Risk</caption>\n<tr><th></th><th width=\"210\">Orbit</th><th>Land</th></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;\" width=\"80\">Short Stay</td>\n<td class=\"vhigh\" colspan=\"2\">600 days in deep space, return trip requires close solar approach (0.7 AU).

Studying partial gravity in particular is tricky\u2014you can do it on the Moon (42% of martian gravity) and hope the results extend to Mars, or you can build rotating structures in space and do more precise tests there.\n\n<p>Studying radiation effects means flying animals outside the magnetosphere for a few years and then watching them for tumors, which (unless the radiation news is really bad) is also going to take some time.\n\n<p>In software engineering we have a useful concept called \u201cyak shaving\u201d. To get started on a project you must first prepare your tools, which often involves reconfiguring your programming environment, which may mean updating software, which requires finding a long-disused password, and pretty soon you find yourself under the office chair with a hex wrench. (The TV show Malcolm in the Middle has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0\">a beautiful illustration</a> of yak shaving in the context of home repair.) \n\n<p>The same phenomenon afflicts us in trying to go to Mars. It would be one thing if, given enough rockets and money, explorers could climb on a spaceship and go. But there is always this chain of necessary prerequisites. We paint <i>Destination: Mars!</i> on the side of our spaceship and then find ourselves in low Earth orbit a decade later, centrifuging mice. It\u2019s dispiriting.\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s tempting to say \u201cyou can just build things\u201d and dismiss all this research and testing as timid and unnecessary. But this would mean ignoring the biggest risk factor for Mars, which I\u2019ll include here for the sake of completeness.\n\n<table class=\"risk\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<caption>Unknown Risks</caption>\n<tr><th></th><th width=\"210\">Orbit</th><th>Land</th></tr>\n\n\n<tr><td style=\"font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;\">Short Stay</td>\n<td class=\"unknown\">Unknown\n</td>\n<td class=\"unknown\">Unknown\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;\">Long Stay</td>\n<td class=\"unknown\">Unknown\n</td>\n<td class=\"unknown\">Unknown \n\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>A trip to Mars is so difficult that we don\u2019t have the luxury of ignoring known risks\u2014we need all the room we can spare in our risk budget for the things we don\u2019t know to worry about yet.\n\n<p>My goal in all this is not to kill a cherished dream, but to try to push people to a more realistic view of what it means to commit to a Mars landing, and in particular to think about going to Mars in terms of opportunity costs.\n\n<p>In recent years, there\u2019s been a remarkable division in space exploration.  On one side of the divide are missions like Curiosity, James Webb, Gaia, or Euclid that are making new discoveries by the day. These projects have clearly defined goals and a formidable record of discovery. \n\n<p>On the other side, there is the International Space Station and the now twenty-year old effort to return Americans to the moon. These projects have no purpose other than perpetuating a human presence in space, and they eat through half the country\u2019s space budget with nothing to show for it.  Forget even Mars\u2014we are further from landing on the Moon today than we were in 1965.\n\n<p>In going to Mars, we have a choice about which side of this ledger to be on. We can go aggressively explore the planet with robots, benefiting from an ongoing revolution in automation and software to launch ever more capable missions to the places most likely to harbor life.  \n\n<p>Or we can stay on the treadmill we\u2019ve been on for forty years,  slowly building up the capacity to land human beings on the safest possible piece of Martian real estate, where they will leave behind a plaque and a flag.  But we can\u2019t do both.\n\n<p>Next time: Eyes and Bones\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\n\n<p><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn_aaron\" name=\"aaron\">[1]</a> \n Quote taken from a 2000 <a href=\"https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/AaronJW/AaronJW_1-21-00.htm\">oral history</a> with Aaron. \n\n<p><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn_early_mars\" name=\"early_mars\">[2]</a> For an early example, see the 1928 Scientific American article, \u201c<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/can_we_go_to_mars.htm\">Can we go to Mars?</a>\u201d, While understandably hand-wavy about the means of propulsion, it describes a conjunction-class orbital mission not substantially different from NASA\u2019s 2009 Design Reference Architecture.\n\n<p><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn_durations\" name=\"durations\">[3]</a> Valerii Polyakov set the 437 day record on a space flight that landed in 1995. The International Space Station went without resupply from Nov 25, 2002 to April 2, 2003. Nine Apollo missions went beyond low Earth orbit, the longest of these (Apollo 17) was gone 12.4 days.\n\n<p><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn_first_rockets\" name=\"first_rockets\">[4]</a> The Saturn V was capable of launching about 20 tons on a Mars flyby trajectory. NASA <a href=\"http://www.astronautix.com/j/jagmarsflyby1966.html\">undertook preliminary planning</a> for such a mission (requiring four Saturn V launches) in 1967.  \n\n<p><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn_breakthroughs\" name=\"breakthroughs\">[5]</a> In 1987 a team chaired by Sally Ride proposed <a href=\"https://archive.is/gmZoN\">a \u2018split/sprint\u2019 mission architecture</a> that is probably the best way to get to Mars. In this architecture, slow-moving tankers pre-position cryogenic propellant depots in Mars orbit, and then in the next synodic period a human mission (the \u201csprint\u201d part of the mission) lands briefly on Mars, refuels from the orbiting depots, and get home within 400 days.  Such a mission requires about 15 heavy launches and two nonexistent technologies: long-term storage of liquid hydrogen in space, and the ability to pump liquid hydrogen between spacecraft in space.  (Interestingly, both of these technologies are part of Blue Origin's plan to build a moon lander). \n\n<p>The other way to get to Mars fast is with nuclear thermal rockets. A nuclear thermal rocket is just a nuclear reactor that shoots hot hydrogen out one end. Nuclear thermal rocket designs are about twice as efficient as chemical rockets, making it feasible to fly missions with higher delta V requirements.\n\n\n<p><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn_apollo_abort\" name=\"apollo_abort\">[6]</a> For a comprehensive discussion of Apollo abort modes, see <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19720017278/downloads/19720017278.pdf\">1972 Apollo Experience Report - Abort Planning</a>.\n\n<p><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn_mars_abort\" name=\"mars_abort\">[7]</a> You can read about possible Mars abort modes in <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332351285_EARTH_TO_MARS_ABORT_ANALYSIS_FOR_HUMAN_MARS_MISSIONS\">Earth to mars Abort Analysis for Human Mars Missions</a>.

They are generally meant to establish narrow and usually simple conceptions of statistical or methodological malfeasance. I think they are important, and that means I do not mind them being boring. I do not react in the slightest when someone tells me \u2018I tried to read it, but it all seemed a bit abstract and I don\u2019t care\u2019. You are not required to care. I am not your mum \u2014 you will feel no inexplicable pull to love me, no matter what I said on your wedding day. I often tell people not to read my work. It will do nothing for either of us. On the other hand, there are other papers about scientific nonsense that you really should read. Generally, they\u2019re not in the forensic metascientific tradition (can I say we have one of those now?), and they take similar observations about how we find inconsistencies and problems within the scientific literature. Then they do what I don\u2019t like to do (unless I\u2019m paid), which is \u2018spend a great deal of time applying them to something important\u2019. This is about one of those papers . 10,000 papers about nothing This paper by Matt Spick and pals is a scientometric analysis of the recent explosion of poor quality papers which draw on information from publicly accessible databases. How much is an explosion? Somewhere between 7000 and 11000 papers which all use free data resources and automated tools to gin up extra papers on topics that sound superficially plausible but are probably a waste of everyone\u2019s time. This is probably a new and growing paper mill product \u2014 rather than fabricating research from scratch , it seems out friends in the bullshit-for-money business have an increasing commercial focus on drawing spurious conclusions from real data . Now, \u2018spurious\u2019 is a load-bearing adjective in that sentence. How are we to know if they are spurious without reading them all? The answer isn\u2019t very satisfying to me right now, and it\u2019s \u2018we\u2019ve read enough of them to notice a strong patternicity in their problems\u2019. I would prefer something more empirical, like: ingesting all of them and finding some textual features that connect them same, but evaluating their reference and author network for a similar signal analyzing a much higher percentage of them for relevance and accuracy You might have noticed that all of these things are hard and annoying. In research integrity, this is when the work often stops\u2014 because very few people are paid to do it.  You need engineers, lawyers, and money. But at least this is a tractable problem! There are many ways to analyze ten thousand papers. But coming over the top rope like Macho Man Randy Savage, there is one more obvious factor: you can make any big data set say anything . Analytical flexibility is a bit like a prescription opiate \u2014 people understand it, but they do not understand it, because they have never tried it. Happily, you don\u2019t have to pawn your jacket to try analytical flexibility. Try it sometime. It\u2019s upsetting how easy it is. Start with the data and work outwards. Kitchen sink the bastard. Invent new cut-offs. Pick the wrong model. Throw it down the stairs, shake it off, and try it again. Imagine someone paid you when you were finished. It\u2019s so very, very possible. So what are we going to do about it? And who is \u2018we\u2019? How to stop the next 10,000 papers about nothing There are two suggestions given above: (1) some kind of access controls around these databases (2) pre-registering analysis These are the logical answers, but they\u2019re both challenging for their own reasons. (1) is fraught, because NHANES, BioBank, FAERS, etc. are open resources designed to be fully accessible to anyone for any reason (or in some cases, any justifiable reason if you\u2019re a researcher etc.), and we generally regard that as a net good, regardless of what people do with them. The regulation that exists around these databases would need to change, and then we would also need to institute those access controls, which is work. We have switched from 10,000 papers to 10,000 evaluations of data requests probably by small teams of people who now bear the burden of oversight . Watch that last sentence carefully, it\u2019s about to have a friend. (2) is probably the most obvious answer \u2014 make sure any analysis from a API-accessible database is first registered before any kind of access or analysis takes place, in the manner of a registered report . LINK A RR is peer reviewed twice , once before any work is done to evaluate the proposed analysis for meaningfulness, quality, etc. and once after the work is done to ensure that the proposed analysis was followed exactly. We have switched from 10,000 papers to 10,000 registered reports, which is 20,000 individual peer reviews, probably by small teams of people who now bear the burden of oversight . Yep, it\u2019s that again. Or let\u2019s say we toned this down, and made the criteria for publication \u2018any pre-registration\u2019 instead of a Registered Report. That is, you make and publish a public analysis plan. I don\u2019t suggest pre-reg as a solution to a lot of problems, because it\u2019s evolved into something where some people do it well, and most people do it not well enough for it to matter. Analytical flexibility can persist through even a fairly well-constrained pre-description of an analysis. And, of course, a lot of people don\u2019t follow their pre-registration plan anyway, because reviewers don\u2019t read them. So, for this to be a solution, we have switched from 10,000 papers to 10,000 pre-registration documents which need to be read and incorporated into review. You see the pattern at this point. Every time you move a burden of oversight around, someone has to do it. When we propose any modification to a publication scheme, we should think very carefully about who receives that hot potato. Especially when some form of oversight is moved from \u2018lots of different journals and peer review pools\u2019 to \u2018a small group of people with specific expertise who don\u2019t currently bear the burden of it\u2019. Don\u2019t get me wrong, neither of these are BAD ideas. They\u2019re just complicated, and they\u2019re insufficiently radical for me, a grump who spends half the night drinking Cynar 70, listening to old Iniquity albums, and writing screeds like this. But at least I have some alternative proposals. I have three, actually. One is obvious, and boring, and already being implemented. The others are more expensive and annoying, but they do have some advantages: they\u2019re like to be a little more future-proof, and they don\u2019t have scaling problems. Here\u2019s the easy one. Make sure editors know to nuke these products on sight. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s perfectly legitimate to produce new NHANES papers, but if they are included in the context of other work. In the meantime, train all your editors. \u201cNaked NHANES paper? BOOM\u201d Very short loop. And related: Require that any analysis which is mining a public data resource with an accessible API is accompanied by other empirical observations Self-explanatory. We have enough reviews and re-analysis in the world. Using public data entirely for yet another also-ran paper is a river run dry. Some castle in the sky built out of a dataset you can call in a few lines of code should be the start of an empirical process, not the end of one. [IRRITATING UPDATE: I had this in draft from last week, and I hope you can believe me given the amount of goddamn text that has been written above, but events move faster than I can write. Turns out many publishing groups have done exactly this (without me ever having the opportunity to look clever about it, I\u2019ll just be over here trying to convince myself now). From the article: This is obviously a good thing and I am not surprised, because it is an obvious solution and it is free. Anyway, good decision. If I\u2019d know, I wouldn\u2019t have started this. But, now the hard bit.] Improve the technical infrastructure behind these resources so getting an analysis from a free data resource is no more complicated than getting money out of an ATM Leaving a big pile of partially structured mostly labeled data in public is, obviously, a great thing. With a bit more structure , you could have something really interesting \u2014 the ability to put a more structured analysis query into the data platforms, and retrieve an answer that answered a question straight from the source. This would involve a significant amount of back-end work but would reduce the idea of a nonsense paper to a single figure that took 60 seconds to retrieve from the source. Instantly unpublishable on its own, forever. But this comes up against a persistent bias we see over every technical field: standards, assurances, reliability metrics, weights-and-measures stuff and its maintenance over time , is very boring and no-one wants to talk about it. The same neophilia that goes into creating scientific work, where we rush forward towards the New and Shiny, goes into the attitude we have towards tools we build. This isn\u2019t a great failing, it\u2019s human nature. Ask anyone who\u2019s made a resource public \u2014 the public show up, and they can be unreasonably demanding and annoying. If something like this is built, it needs to be maintained . And that\u2019s generally where we screw up, and foresight abandons us. Building persistent resources is hard. What public scientific resources do you wish existed that are reasonably achievable? I think I have catalogues at this point, but I\u2019d like to know other people\u2019s. Leave a comment if it\u2019s something that really lights a fire under your etceteras.",

We got nine datasets, and the responses from the other 12 varied between silence and borderline hostility \u2014 in two cases, which shared no co-authors, identically-worded borderline hostility. However, one of the most surprising responses was not a response at all; our e-mail to the lead and corresponding author bounced. Undeliverable. Address not found. Not so unusual, you might think; after all, people move to new institutions, and their faculty e-mail addresses often evaporate shortly after. But in this case, it was the author's Gmail address that had stopped working. Spooky Do I have your attention? Then let's begin... The article This is the article that attracted our attention: Eskine, K. J., Kacinik, N. A., & Prinz, J. J. (2011). A bad taste in the mouth: Gustatory disgust influences moral judgment. Psychological Science , 22 (3), 295\u2013299. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611398497 On 2025-02-13 I was able to download the PDF file from here (link corrected 2025-08-07). By that point it had acquired 675 citations on Google Scholar and 267 on Web of Science, which seems like quite a lot. Briefly, the article describes a study that investigated whether giving people a small amount of something pleasant or unpleasant to drink also made them more or less harsh in their judgment of moral transgressions that they read about in a series of vignettes (e.g., second cousins having sex, or someone eating their already-dead dog). There were three conditions, depending on which beverage the participants consumed: Bitter, Sweet, or Water (with the latter condition sometimes being referred to as \"control\" in the article). For added fun, and because this was back before the tsunami hit social psychology and it was absolutely standard for any article to have a gratuitous pop at (U.S.) conservatives, there was a test to see whether conservatives were more susceptible to the effects than liberals. I'll let you guess the results, but yeah, you're right. People who were drinking the bitter beverage became more, well, bitter in their judgments of the various transgressions, and the conservatives even more so. Or as the authors put it, \"Taken together, these results suggest that physical disgust helps instantiate moral disgust, and that these effects are more salient in individuals with politically conservative views than in individuals with politically liberal views.\" We flagged up this article because it has several GRIM inconsistencies in Table 1. The article reports (p. 296) that \"An overall moral-judgment score was obtained for each of the ... participants (bitter condition: n = 15; sweet condition: n = 18; control condition: n = 21)\". But the highlighted numbers are not consistent with those sample sizes. For example, for \"Bitter taste\"/\"Sweet drink\", 1.76 * 18 = 31.68, so the nearest possible integer\u2014corresponding to the sum of the participants' ratings\u2014is 32. But 32 / 18 = 1.7777 which should be reported as 1.78. And so on. The combination of seven GRIM problems out of 12 means, plus the effect sizes, made us want to look at the dataset. But as already mentioned, the lead author had deleted his Gmail and apparently gone off the grid. I contacted one of the co-authors of the article but she did not know where Kendall Eskine or the data might be found, and his most recent employer (Loyola University) told me that he had quit without leaving a forwarding address. However, a few months later, James and I were discussing this particular article with a colleague, who \u2014 as it turned out \u2014 had been looking at Eskine's work for some time, and had managed to persuade him to share some datasets, including the one for this article. It was in SPSS format, but it was easy enough for me to convert it to CSV and then analyse it in R. I was able to reproduce all of the results perfectly, apart from the two \"contrasts\" mentioned in the last paragraph of the Results section. In that case the means and SDs are all fine, but if I do a simple t test the t value is off slightly and the DFs are 1 more than what is reported, and I don't see how to get those numbers with ANOVA contrasts either. If anyone can help with this I'd be most grateful. The GRIM issue turns out to be a fairly innocuous mix-up in the reporting of the sample sizes, with the Sweet condition actually having 21 participants and the Water (control) condition having 18, rather than the other way round as reported in the article. Going back to the first number in the Sweet column: 1.76 * 21 = 36.96; the nearest integer is 37; 37 / 21 = 1.7619 which rounds to 1.76; and so on. So, the dataset matches the results and there are no GRIM problems once you fix a typo. Can we go now? (Of course not. Spoiler: this is a blog post, and it has a point to make.) Looking at the dataset, it seems that participants were asked two items about each of the six vignettes, rather than just one. The naming of the variables is a little haphazard at points, but we can see that for every vignette (\"Incest\", \"Eatingdog\", etc) there are two variables, one measuring how (im)moral the participant considered the behaviour to be, and the other apparently measuring how \"appalling\" they found it. However, there is absolutely mention of the second set of measurements anywhere in the article (try it: you won't find the string \"appal\" anywhere in the PDF). It is tempting to imagine that the authors omitted \u2020 to report the results (or even the existence) of the \"appalling\" measure because these were not statistically significant. For example, the main effect of beverage that underpins the results, which for the \"moral\" items was F (2,51)=7.368, p =.002, \u03b7 p \u00b2=.224, only gives F (2,51)=2.511, p =.091, \u03b7 p \u00b2=.090 for the \"appalling\" items, and the other results are similarly unimpressive. The manuscript was submitted is 2010, and back then you weren't going to get into Psychological Science with p =.091. Another noteworthy thing is that the effect sizes are huge. By consuming just two teaspoons of a bitter, sweet, or neutral-tasting beverage, participants' responses came to differ by over one standard deviation. Again, this was all considered entirely plausible in 2010. Furthermore, the sample sizes are small, and for the conservative\u2013liberal contrasts they are tiny, with just 6 conservatives and 7 liberals in the Bitter condition. Now, there is rarely any mystery about where effects like these are coming from in the data. It's either a very large difference in means, or very small standard deviations (leading to small standard errors and hence a larger t ratio)\u2014unless you have a huge sample size, in which case that on its own will give you a small SE. Very small SDs are often a sign of problems, especially if they are associated with means in the middle of the range of possible values, as this suggests that almost everyone was answering in the same \"non-extreme\" way, which doesn't often happen. Looking at the numbers here, however, the SDs appear reasonable, given the authors' claim of a large effect. Put another way, if there really was a true large effect\u2014which is always possible \u2021 \u2014these are something like the SDs that we would expect to see, including the fact that they are smaller for the larger means as the latter approach the limits of the 0\u2013100 rating scale. The effect is thus being driven principally by the difference in the means across the two groups. So what else can we look at? Well, let's think about what the authors were measuring. They asked participants about two attitudes (\"Is it (im)moral?\" and \"Is it appalling?\") to six transgressions. While they didn't claim to be setting out to make a six-item \"Transgression Judgement Scale\", and they did not average the response scores across the six vignettes, we might reasonably expect that people who found any one of them to be immoral/appalling might also have a similar opinion about the others. We can measure the extent to which the authors created an internally consistent measure of people's attitudes to these transgressions by examining the Cronbach's alpha values of each measure in each condition. Here are the alphas for the two attitudes and the three conditions: As you can see, for the Bitter condition, the reliability of the measure is considerably less robust, even though the manipulation is meant to be making people more attuned to moral issues, or more readily appalled, than those sampling the more usual beverages. Let's see what happens when we compute the alphas after breaking the sample down further by political orientation: Did you even know that Cronbach's alpha can be negative? Well, it can, and it's a useful test of a scale that has reverse-scored items \u2014 if you forget to do the reversing, you can end up with a negative alpha. But here, those bitter ol' conservatives are answering the same questions as everyone else. They've just been driven so gosh-darn mad by this appalling immorality that they have no idea what they're doing any more. Or... perhaps something else happened to the data, especially in the bitter condition, and especially for conservatives. <miss_piggy_flutters_eyelashes.gif> Either way, these results tell us very little about what the experiment was supposed to measure. If anyone has an e-mail address for the lead author that still works, perhaps they could send him a pointer to this post and see if he has an explanation for all this. Supporting information I have made the R code and dataset for this post, as well as my annotated copy of the article PDF file, available here . Footnotes \u2020 Unless, of course, the reviewers or editors told the authors to \"simplify\" the story. Simmons et al.'s classic \" False-Positive Psychology \" article did not land on the editor-in-chief's desk at Psychological Science for another four months after Eskine et al.'s article was published. \u2021 I try, not always successfully, to avoid pointing and laughing at studies purely for having large effect sizes. If we dismiss the possibility of large effects a priori, while also dismissing very small effects as being probably due to noise or unmeasured confounding (and in any case probably not of practical interest), we risk declaring that science is only about \"Goldilocks\"-sized effects. I don't know what the effect size of penicillin on staphylococcus was back in the late 1920s, but I suspect that it might cause eyebrows to be raised if Alexander Fleming were to write it up for publication today. That said, I remain skeptical of all effect sizes in social psychology above about d =0.4 that were not written about by Plato or Shakespeare.",

A., &amp; Prinz, J. J. (2011). A bad taste in the mouth: Gustatory disgust influences moral judgment. <i>Psychological Science</i>, <i>22</i>(3), 295\u2013299. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611398497</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\n \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On 2025-02-13 I was able to download the PDF file from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797611398497?casa_token=7x0vHmX4AVQAAAAA:RTHJk5IuWTJ0E87Rp207vLW-Gfp7H0hpizu20eE72fB1Ty1WCq3_-e3gzKWdLbaVFiNCRnwNrw\">here</a>&nbsp;(link corrected 2025-08-07). By that point it had acquired 675 citations on Google Scholar and 267 on Web of Science, which seems like quite a lot.</p><p>Briefly, the article describes a study that investigated whether giving people a small amount of something pleasant or unpleasant to drink also made them more or less harsh in their judgment of moral transgressions that they read about in a series of vignettes (e.g., second cousins having sex, or someone eating their already-dead dog). There were three conditions, depending on which beverage the participants consumed: Bitter, Sweet, or Water (with the latter condition sometimes being referred to as \"control\" in the article). For added fun, and because this was back before the tsunami hit social psychology and it was absolutely standard for any article to have a gratuitous pop at (U.S.) conservatives, there was a test to see whether conservatives were more susceptible to the effects than liberals.</p><p>I'll let you guess the results, but yeah, you're right. People who were drinking the bitter beverage became more, well, bitter in their judgments of the various transgressions, and the conservatives even more so. Or as the authors put it, \"Taken together, these results suggest that physical disgust helps instantiate moral disgust, and that these effects are more salient in individuals with politically conservative views than in individuals with politically liberal views.\"</p><p>We flagged up this article because it has several GRIM inconsistencies in Table 1.</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibIbSyigYZlNshcdPZ7A29atgq9qWXCYOkwVhp03OahneHVYtsc-GhBirHG-jmI_zhnyfRnCDLy5sPnqEeDzjJH3_5sUpcYcQ9Av5N7I-kcswa1BSqPF5R4ftTkVrUYyzSIZ6H4AYNpMMTX9-l-0jxbeN9QETXMK2TYtoGTnrQaEzxRulHLpY5-mliwOcs/s775/Untitled.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibIbSyigYZlNshcdPZ7A29atgq9qWXCYOkwVhp03OahneHVYtsc-GhBirHG-jmI_zhnyfRnCDLy5sPnqEeDzjJH3_5sUpcYcQ9Av5N7I-kcswa1BSqPF5R4ftTkVrUYyzSIZ6H4AYNpMMTX9-l-0jxbeN9QETXMK2TYtoGTnrQaEzxRulHLpY5-mliwOcs/w640-h244/Untitled.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><div style=\"line-height: 24px;\"><br /></div><div style=\"line-height: 24px;\">The article reports (p. 296) that \"An overall moral-judgment score was obtained for each of the ... participants (bitter condition: n = 15; sweet condition: n = 18; control condition: n = 21)\". But the highlighted numbers are not consistent with those sample sizes. For example, for \"Bitter taste\"/\"Sweet drink\", 1.76 * 18 = 31.68, so the nearest possible integer\u2014corresponding to the sum of the participants' ratings\u2014is 32. But 32 / 18 = 1.7777 which should be reported as 1.78. And so on.</div><div style=\"line-height: 24px;\"><br /></div><div style=\"line-height: 24px;\">The combination of seven GRIM problems out of 12 means, plus the effect sizes, made us want to look at the dataset. But as already mentioned, the lead author had deleted his Gmail and apparently gone off the grid. I contacted one of the co-authors of the article but she did not know where Kendall Eskine or the data might be found, and his most recent employer (Loyola University) told me that he had quit without leaving a forwarding address.</div><div style=\"line-height: 24px;\"><br /></div><div style=\"line-height: 24px;\">However, a few months later, James and I were discussing this particular article with a colleague, who \u2014 as it turned out \u2014 had been looking at Eskine's work for some time, and had managed to persuade him to share some datasets, including the one for this article. It was in SPSS format, but it was easy enough for me to convert it to CSV and then analyse it in R.</div><div style=\"line-height: 24px;\"><br /></div><div style=\"line-height: 24px;\">I was able to reproduce all of the results perfectly, apart from the two \"contrasts\" mentioned in the last paragraph of the Results section. In that case the means and SDs are all fine, but if I do a simple <i>t</i> test the <i>t</i> value is off slightly and the DFs are 1 more than what is reported, and I don't see how to get those numbers with ANOVA contrasts either. If anyone can help with this I'd be most grateful.</div><p>The GRIM issue turns out to be a fairly innocuous mix-up in the reporting of the sample sizes, with the Sweet condition actually having 21 participants and the Water (control) condition having 18, rather than the other way round as reported in the article. Going back to the first number in the Sweet column: 1.76 * 21 = 36.96; the nearest integer is 37; 37 / 21 = 1.7619 which rounds to 1.76; and so on.</p><p>So, the dataset matches the results and there are no GRIM problems once you fix a typo. Can we go now? (Of course not. Spoiler: this is a blog post, and it has a point to make.)</p><p>Looking at the dataset, it seems that participants were asked two items about each of the six vignettes, rather than just one.</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgY-TVD9EFpv2fSUTNwlt4GVHkuJju3uBKrAHOiuLWFDY8hnf8ufsjaiKPylAUFx2UX_n976o9bCzS_2n-uJe2gXL5_pCeGgdKFctMryt6OeCV1MSPuFuUBf8doaZN6iILPmuO9kCL3YpQvw1wqHalREwdTWT81Ea6PWvQBZu6j65LTkGWF354qp_nxj2Zt/s449/Untitled.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgY-TVD9EFpv2fSUTNwlt4GVHkuJju3uBKrAHOiuLWFDY8hnf8ufsjaiKPylAUFx2UX_n976o9bCzS_2n-uJe2gXL5_pCeGgdKFctMryt6OeCV1MSPuFuUBf8doaZN6iILPmuO9kCL3YpQvw1wqHalREwdTWT81Ea6PWvQBZu6j65LTkGWF354qp_nxj2Zt/w640-h281/Untitled.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><p>The naming of the variables is a little haphazard at points, but we can see that for every vignette (\"Incest\", \"Eatingdog\", etc) there are two variables, one measuring how (im)moral the participant considered the behaviour to be, and the other apparently measuring how \"appalling\" they found it. However, there is absolutely mention of the second set of measurements anywhere in the article (try it: you won't find the string \"appal\" anywhere in the PDF).</p><p>It is tempting to imagine that the authors omitted<sup>\u2020</sup>&nbsp;to report the results (or even the existence) of the \"appalling\" measure because these were not statistically significant. For example, the main effect of beverage that underpins the results, which for the \"moral\" items was&nbsp;<i>F</i>(2,51)=7.368, <i>p</i>=.002, \u03b7<i><sub>p</sub></i>\u00b2=.224, only gives <i>F</i>(2,51)=2.511, <i>p</i>=.091, \u03b7<i><sub>p</sub></i>\u00b2=.090 for the \"appalling\" items, and the other results are similarly unimpressive. The manuscript was submitted is 2010, and back then you weren't going to get into <i>Psychological Science</i> with <i>p</i>=.091.</p><p>Another noteworthy thing is that the effect sizes are huge. By consuming just two teaspoons of a bitter, sweet, or neutral-tasting beverage, participants' responses came to differ by over one standard deviation. Again, this was all considered entirely plausible in 2010. Furthermore, the sample sizes are small, and for the conservative\u2013liberal contrasts they are tiny, with just 6 conservatives and 7 liberals in the Bitter condition.</p><p>Now, there is rarely any mystery about where effects like these are coming from in the data. It's either a very large difference in means, or very small standard deviations (leading to small standard errors and hence a larger&nbsp;<i>t</i>&nbsp;ratio)\u2014unless you have a huge sample size, in which case that on its own will give you a small SE. Very small SDs are often a sign of problems, especially if they are associated with means in the middle of the range of possible values, as this suggests that almost everyone was answering in the same \"non-extreme\" way, which doesn't often happen. Looking at the numbers here, however, the SDs appear reasonable, given the authors' claim of a large effect.

While they didn't claim to be setting out to make a six-item \"Transgression Judgement Scale\", and they did not average the response scores across the six vignettes, we might reasonably expect that people who found any one of them to be immoral/appalling might also have a similar opinion about the others.

It\u2019s hard to not rub our worry stones over whatever it is that keeps us up at night. Even though food is one of those everyday, multiple times a day things, it probably isn\u2019t what many people worry about. But too many people do. Canal Alliance , the non-profit that runs the food pantry I volunteer for, didn\u2019t have any drops in food allotments while the US government was shut down. This undoubtedly was because the SF Marin Food Bank continued to hum along supported by private donations. (You can donate here .) While many of our clients, mostly Guatemalan and Mexican, also rely on SNAP dollars to feed their families, I knew they were getting at least two 25-30 pound bags of nutritious food each week. Young bok choy lovers at the Canal Alliance. Despite this sometimes bounty, food insecurity lingers. Here\u2019s an opinion piece about the scars left by the uncertainty of hunger in The Guardian by Priya Fielding-Singh, author of the excellent book called How The Other Half Eats . This Tuesday was a federal holiday in the US and our food pantry was closed. This happens once or twice a year and it always leaves me with a knot of my own worry. What did our clients do? Were they able to make ends meat? There are all kinds of ways we can worry over food. My own stem from having Type-1 diabetes. I never go anywhere without a stash of food in my bag should my blood sugar drops. While it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been caught without food, the knowledge of how bad it *could* is embedded in my skin. Maybe food is simple enough that it\u2019s preferable to worrying about it over what\u2019s more complex like our jobs, relationships, family. With Thanksgiving just around the corner some may be wondering where they\u2019ll eat, or what they\u2019ll eat. Its one of my favorite holidays yet it\u2019s fraught with decisions and interactions. Once again this year my own family will put together our new tradition, which we started last year. It\u2019s called \u2018hotel room picnic\u2019. We all add to a random potluck of items \u2014 things that can be easily bought from a market or made in the room. Then we spread it out on whatever random tables we have, eat and play games. We\u2019re fortunate to have the means to stay at a hotel and shop for food. And like any meal, it\u2019s more fun and plentiful when we work together. What there won\u2019t be at our Thanksgiving is pumpkin pie. No one likes it enough to buy it. I\u2019m not even tempted by Costco\u2019s version, which is reported to be made from scratch. The filling is bought a year early and put in cold storage to improve the texture \u2014 the pumpkin fiber absorbs the water content making it thicker. In 2024, Costco sold around 9 million pies. Three million were sold in the three days before Thanksgiving. None of them to me. Whatever your pie of choice is, please consider donating to your local food pantry. Leave a comment I\u2019m just here for the tidbits: Israel-based Remilk launched its dairy milk analog made using precision fermentation (PF) techniques. You can find it at cafes in Israel starting this December, with retail stores coming in January. I\u2019ve got my cousin ready to track it down and try it for us. I\u2019ve tasted other PF versions several times. One I liked because it was creamy and thick. Another I did not like because it smelled liked dairy milk, which was the last thing I wanted. What we drink in our coffee, put in our cereal or drink with a chocolate chip cookie is so personal. In Israel, 92% of households surveyed consume animal-based milk; 61% also consume milk alternatives. In the US, 94% consume dairy milk; and around 42% purchase plant-based milk alternatives. In my fridge, survey of two people, there\u2019s a carton of half and half and one, for me, of hazelnut milk. The Every Company, which I wrote about in a chapter of my book \u201c Technically Food ,\u201d raised $55-million in a Series D to help it scale its precision fermentation derived egg proteins to more food service bakeries. Ingredients are the fastest way to adoption and I look forward to seeing it on more shelves. Have you heard? Tariffs are hitting dried pasta . The price hit could be as high as 107%. This includes a 15% baseline on European Union goods plus a crazy-seeming 92% levy over Italian pasta \u2014 made from durum wheat \u2014 makers that are undercutting American pasta \u2014 made from traditional wheat \u2014 brands. (Or so we\u2019re told.) Some Italian brands are actually made here including Buitoni and Barilla. I\u2019m a very rare pasta buyer, but the last box I bought was De Cecco, which is made in Italy. I cooked this one-pan ditalini and peas pasta recipe from Smitten Kitchen. It was fabulous. I look forward to getting a better understanding of the minutia of hitting dried goods with tariffs versus making healthcare affordable. Anyone? Food in 2026 will be swangy and swavory, two made-up words that are fun to say.

Vow, a cultured meat producer in Australia, is selling its first retail products including foie gras, croquettes, and smoked cultured quail spread. We\u2019re talking mostly butter fat here in addition to 40% cultured cells but I bet its yummy on toast. I doubt they\u2019re shipping to the US, but give it a try here . Don\u2019t know what to buy for that weird food lover in your family? Oishii, a high-end indoor fruit grower in New Jersey, is making jam out of its perfect strawberries. Actually, the jam is probably made from all the too-small or wonky imperfect berries. I don\u2019t eat much jam but this one is calling me.

Here&#8217;s an opinion piece about the scars left by the uncertainty of hunger in <em>The Guardian</em> by Priya Fielding-Singh, author of the excellent book called <em><a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-the-other-half-eats-priya-fielding-singh-phd/1138785984;jsessionid=F6C3A22A13521CBF700DE8F496679DC3.prodny_store01-atgap08?ean=9780316427272\">How The Other Half Eats</a></em>. This Tuesday was a federal holiday in the US and our food pantry was closed. This happens once or twice a year and it always leaves me with a knot of my own worry. What did our clients do? Were they able to make ends meat?</p><p>There are all kinds of ways we can worry over food. My own stem from having Type-1 diabetes. I never go anywhere without a stash of food in my bag should my blood sugar drops. While it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been caught without food, the knowledge of how bad it <strong>*could*</strong> is embedded in my skin.</p><p>Maybe food is simple enough that it&#8217;s preferable to worrying about it over what&#8217;s more complex like our jobs, relationships, family. With Thanksgiving just around the corner some may be wondering where they&#8217;ll eat, or what they&#8217;ll eat. Its one of my favorite holidays yet it&#8217;s fraught with decisions and interactions.</p><p>Once again this year my own family will put together our new tradition, which we started last year. It&#8217;s called &#8216;hotel room picnic&#8217;. We all add to a random potluck of items &#8212; things that can be easily bought from a market or made in the room. Then we spread it out on whatever random tables we have, eat and play games. We&#8217;re fortunate to have the means to stay at a hotel and shop for food. And like any meal, it&#8217;s more fun and plentiful when we work together. </p><p>What there won&#8217;t be at our Thanksgiving is pumpkin pie. No one likes it enough to buy it. I&#8217;m not even tempted by Costco&#8217;s version, which is reported to be made from scratch. The filling is bought a year early and put in cold storage to improve the texture &#8212; the pumpkin fiber absorbs the water content making it thicker. In 2024, Costco sold around 9 million pies. Three million were sold in the three days before Thanksgiving. None of them to me.</p><p>Whatever your pie of choice is, please consider donating to your local food pantry.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://technicallyfood.substack.com/p/flavor-tourism/comments\"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><h4>I&#8217;m just here for the tidbits:</h4><ol><li><p>Israel-based Remilk launched its <a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/new-milk-signals-new-phase-for-recombinant-dairy-says-remilk-it-doesnt-look-like-another-alternative-product\">dairy milk analog</a> made using precision fermentation (PF) techniques.

(Image: DALL-E) Large language models should not be used to weed out retracted literature, a study of 21 chatbots concludes. Not only were the chatbots unreliable at correctly identifying retracted papers, they spit out different results when given the same prompts. The \u201cvery simple study,\u201d as lead author Konradin Metze called it, used LLM chatbots like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and others to see whether they would successfully identify retracted articles in a list of references. Metze and colleagues compiled a list of 132 publications. The list comprised the 50 most cited, retracted papers by Joachim Boldt, a prolific German researcher who also sits at the top of the Retraction Watch Leaderboard . Another 50 were Boldt\u2019s most cited non-retracted papers. The rest were works by other researchers with the last name \u201cBoldt\u201d and first initial of \u201cJ.\u201d The study authors prompted each chatbot to indicate which of the listed references had been retracted. On average, the 21 chatbots correctly identified fewer than half of the retracted papers , the authors reported October 10 in the Journal of Clinical Anesthesia . The LLMs also produced a large proportion of false positives, incorrectly classifying almost 18 percent of Boldt\u2019s intact papers, and about 4.5 percent of other authors\u2019 valid work as retracted. After a three-month gap, the researchers queried seven of the 21 original chatbots with a different, shorter, prompt, as well as repeating the original prompt. \u201cWe know that the wording of the prompt may influence the answer,\u201d said Metze, a researcher at the State University of Campinas, in Brazil. \u201cIf you ask a question to a chatbot, and you repeat the same prompt tomorrow, you may get different answers. This is not scientific, and it\u2019s a great, great problem.\u201d Comparing responses from April and July, the researchers did find differences, as expected. Whereas the chatbots in the first round classified papers as retracted or not retracted, in the second round they created a new, hybrid reply, flagging a particular paper as possibly retracted, saying, for example, a paper was \u201cworth double-checking,\u201d \u201cis likely one of the retracted ones\u201d or \u201chigh-risk papers to verify.\u201d In practical terms, this hedging is useless, Metze said. The results of Metze and colleagues\u2019 experiment are hardly surprising, said Serge Horbach , assistant professor in the sociology of science at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who has written about generative AI in research . \u201cI read the article as a warning: People, please don\u2019t use LLMs this way.\u201d But the paper replicates\u00a0just what a conscientious\u00a0author might do \u2014 enter a list of references for an LLM to check as a shortcut to the time-consuming process of checking them individually, said Mike Thelwall of the University of Sheffield, in England. In August, Thelwall and colleagues asked ChatGPT to evaluate 217 articles that had been retracted, had expressions of concern, or had been flagged on PubPeer or another platform. They submitted each article to ChatGPT 30 times. None of the 6,510 reports generated mentioned the retractions or concerns, they reported in Learned Publishing . ChatGPT \u201creported some retracted facts as true, and classified some retracted papers as high quality,\u201d Thelwall said. \u201cSo it does not seem to be designed to be aware of, or careful about, retracted information at the time that we tested it.\u201d LLMs are also using material from retracted scientific papers to answer questions on their chatbot interfaces, according to a study in the Journal of Advanced Research in May 2025. \u201cPeople are increasingly using ChatGPT or similar to summarize topics, and this shows that they risk being misled by the inclusion of retracted information,\u201d Thelwall added. Generative AI does have roles to play in the editorial process, Horbach said. But weeding out retracted papers is not yet among them, he said \u2014and \u201cit\u2019s not going to lead to any better science.\u201d Like Retraction Watch?

Not only were the chatbots unreliable at correctly identifying retracted papers, they spit out different results when given the same prompts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201cvery simple study,\u201d as lead author <a href=\"https://portal.dados.unicamp.br/perfil?docente=206822&amp;sigla_unidade=FCM&amp;nome_unidade=FACULDADE%252520DE%252520CIENCIAS%252520MEDICAS&amp;lang=en\">Konradin Metze</a> called it, used LLM chatbots like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and others to see whether they would successfully identify retracted articles in a list of references.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Metze and colleagues compiled a list of 132 publications. The list comprised the 50 most cited, retracted papers by Joachim Boldt, a prolific German researcher who also sits at the top of the <a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/\">Retraction Watch Leaderboard</a>. Another 50 were Boldt\u2019s most cited non-retracted papers. The rest were works by other researchers with the last name \u201cBoldt\u201d and first initial of \u201cJ.\u201d The study authors prompted each chatbot to indicate which of the listed references had been retracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-133350\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>On average, the 21 chatbots correctly identified fewer than half <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952818025002934\">of the retracted papers</a>, the authors reported October 10 in the <em>Journal of Clinical Anesthesia</em>. The LLMs also produced a large proportion of false positives, incorrectly classifying almost 18 percent of Boldt\u2019s intact papers, and about 4.5 percent of other authors\u2019 valid work as retracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a three-month gap, the researchers queried seven of the 21 original chatbots with a different, shorter, prompt, as well as repeating the original prompt. \u201cWe know that the wording of the prompt may influence the answer,\u201d said Metze, a researcher at the State University of Campinas, in Brazil. \u201cIf you ask a question to a chatbot, and you repeat the same prompt tomorrow, you may get different answers. This is not scientific, and it\u2019s a great, great problem.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing responses from April and July, the researchers did find differences, as expected. Whereas the chatbots in the first round classified papers as retracted or not retracted, in the second round they created a new, hybrid reply, flagging a particular paper as possibly retracted, saying, for example, a paper was \u201cworth double-checking,\u201d \u201cis likely one of the retracted ones\u201d or \u201chigh-risk papers to verify.\u201d In practical terms, this hedging is useless, Metze said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results of Metze and colleagues\u2019 experiment are hardly surprising, said <a href=\"https://www.ru.nl/en/people/horbach-s\">Serge Horbach</a>, assistant professor in the sociology of science at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who has <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X2500003X?via%253Dihub\">written about</a> <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00337/125096/Open-Science-at-the-generative-AI-turn-An\">generative AI in research</a>. \u201cI read the article as a warning: People, please don\u2019t use LLMs this way.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the paper replicates&nbsp;just what a conscientious&nbsp;author might do \u2014 enter a list of references for an LLM to check as a shortcut to the time-consuming process of checking them individually, said Mike Thelwall of the University of Sheffield, in England.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August, Thelwall and colleagues <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/leap.2018\">asked ChatGPT to evaluate 217 articles that had been retracted, had expressions of concern, or had been flagged on PubPeer or another platform. </a>&nbsp;They submitted each article to ChatGPT 30 times. None of the 6,510 reports generated mentioned the retractions or concerns, they reported in <em>Learned Publishing</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT \u201creported some retracted facts as true, and classified some retracted papers as high quality,\u201d Thelwall said. \u201cSo it does not seem to be designed to be aware of, or careful about, retracted information at the time that we tested it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LLMs are also using <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123225001808\">material from retracted scientific papers</a> to answer questions on their chatbot interfaces, according to a study in the <em>Journal of Advanced Research</em> in May 2025. \u201cPeople are increasingly using ChatGPT or similar to summarize topics, and this shows that they risk being misled by the inclusion of retracted information,\u201d Thelwall added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generative AI does have roles to play in the editorial process, Horbach said. But weeding out retracted papers is not yet among them, he said \u2014and \u201cit\u2019s not going to lead to any better science.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Like Retraction Watch?

In 1987, the pugnacious singer-songwriter Billy Joel was touring the Soviet Union, as one of the first outside musicians permitted to perform there since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961. The tour was being recorded and filmed, in an effort not only to preserve these historic shows for posterity, but to recoup the tour\u2019s exorbitant costs. Joel was not accustomed to Soviet audiences; they didn\u2019t react to his hits with the same enthusiasm his American fans did. He would later tell a New York Times reporter that the unresponsive crowd at his July 27 Moscow show was akin to \u201can oil painting.\u201d \u201cI've been on the road for 11 months,\u201d he went on, by way of explaining what was about to happen. \u201cIt's difficult. I'm running ragged.\u201d Joel\u2019s camera crew \u2014 the one he had hired to document the tour \u2014 roamed the stage, grabbing closeups of the musicians, and generally getting in the way. They had brightly illuminated the first few rows of fans, and to Joel\u2019s mind, this inhibited the show\u2019s energy, and exposed the artificiality of his performance. At one point, during his song \u201cIt\u2019s Just a Fantasy,\u201d Joel began to lose his temper. There is a video of this moment on YouTube. Between sung lines, Joel shouts at the crew: \u201cStop it! Leave me alone!\u201d Finally, exasperated, he screams, \u201cLet me do my show, for chrissake!\u201d and he tips over his electric piano, which crashes noisily to the floor. The YouTube video cuts some seconds ahead; now Joel\u2019s downstage, a microphone stand in his hands. He raises it above his head and smashes it repeatedly into a stage monitor, while the band plays on behind him. When a cameraman gets too close, Joel goes after him. The cameraman turns and runs, but it\u2019s too late: Joel kicks him in the ass. \u201cIt was a real prima donna act,\u201d Joel later admitted to the Times reporter. \u201cBut I have to protect my show.\u201d * In the fall of 1983, my grandfather volunteered to drive us all down to Annapolis to watch the Lafayette College football team play against Navy. It would be a longish trip \u2013 three hours, at a minimum, if the traffic was light \u2013 and there were six of us. So my grandfather acquired a van. My grandparents Mary and Robert Stein, dancing at my parents\u2019 wedding in 1968 He was a doctor, a Jew, and a prominent citizen, in his day, of Easton, Pennsylvania, the small city on the Delaware River where I was born. If Easton ever had a heyday, it was long past by 1984; it\u2019s one of those towns near enough to New York and Philadelphia to get mired in their effluvia (drugs, poverty, race and class tension), but not close enough to appeal to commuters, or at least the kind of commuters who can stand spending most of their time at home. My grandfather (Robert Stein was his name) was the resident physician at Lafayette, presiding over its student health center and serving as a perpetual sideline presence, stethoscope hung around his neck, at scholastic sporting events. The sight of him running out onto the field when a player got hurt is one of the signature dramatic motifs of my childhood, and one probable reason that my congenital disdain for organized sports remained latent for so long. Pop Pop was gruff, brooding, mercurial, yet capable of great kindness and generosity. He was also, insofar as this was possible in Easton, a player. He liked to be at the center of things. (His conquest of my grandmother, his rather younger secretary, must certainly have been one of the great social triumphs of his life. I have a photo of them dancing at my parents\u2019 wedding; in it, my grandmother, prematurely silver-haired at 41, is undeniably, devastatingly hot, and my grandfather gazes at her with an expression of giddy, almost unhinged and triumphant love. It was the second and last marriage for both of them.) He also liked to spend money. Objects of mysterious origin routinely appeared in my grandparents\u2019 home, fancy things: obscure and delectable chocolates, the two-inch-thick steaks we ate on Sunday afternoons, bottles of liquor backlit by the deluxe wet bar cleverly built into a hallway of their apartment. Doc Stein collected art, too: I\u2019ve got the Dali now, and Mom\u2019s got the Picasso, and none of us are quite sure what to do about the Frederic Remington bronze cowboy that may or may not have been stolen from a museum in Newark. My grandfather tended to keep mum about where he got stuff, in part, I think, in order to cultivate an air of mysteriousness and power (he wouldn\u2019t, for instance, let me bring home copies of Omni magazine from the apartment to read, making it clear that he and he alone was their keeper, and that I enjoyed them exclusively at his pleasure), and in part because a lot of it came from local mobsters. He was their doctor; he didn\u2019t charge them, and was remunerated in goods and favors. (Thus the Remington, and the fact that, in those days, I never once saw him pay for a meal in an Italian restaurant.) Indeed, this is how my grandfather preferred to do business: he was a handshake deal kind of guy. So he didn\u2019t rent a van the day we went to Maryland: he sourced one. From a friend who owed him a favor. The van was awesome. I would love to have it now. It was brown, brown, brown, like a mashup of nineteen-seventies kitchen appliances, and plushly accoutered inside, with leather-upholstered seats and carpeting that I remember as thick pile but was probably not. The point is this, though: my leadfooted grandfather rode the brakes all the way to Maryland, wearing them down to the metal, and we ended up pulling into a suburban mechanic\u2019s garage somewhere outside Baltimore, wreathed in a cloud of acrid smoke. Nobody owed my grandfather any favors here; he and my father had to prod and cajole the mechanic into finding the parts he needed and prioritizing our repair over that of his regular customers. Even so, we were stuck for a long time, and that van, its back doors open to the balmy fall air, became the crucible of my future adult self. I got angry back there, with my books and tapes and boredom, far from my witty Dungeons and Dragons friends and brutally terrible rock band. I hated football, I realized; I hated road trips, I hated everyone. Familial pressure to attend college (an inevitability I passionately advocated for, yet still somehow managed to resent) was stirring; there would be, post-brake-replacement, many unsubtle hints that perhaps I would enjoy attending the Naval Academy. During those unseasonably warm suburban Maryland hours, my petty resentments would catch fire and begin to change form. Those moments were remaking me into, god forbid, a sort of almost near-man. I have no recollection of what I was reading that day, but I sure remember the soundtrack. I had one cassette in my Walkman, a Maxell XLII-S90, which I had impregnated with two LP\u2019s not long before (while sitting perfectly still at the dining room table, obnoxiously policing my family so that their heavy footsteps wouldn\u2019t rumble or stutter the vinyl): Billy Joel\u2019s Turnstiles and Billy Joel\u2019s Streetlife Serenade. * Even within the confines of this exercise, wherein I cast my mind back to an era when, free from the contextualizing influence of rock history that now prevents me from unironically enjoying the music of Billy Joel [2025 note: I\u2019m over it, I can just enjoy him now], I cannot say that I ever regarded Streetlife Serenade as a good album. The follow-up to his waltz-in-limericks hit (or, non-hit, as Joel told actor Alec Baldwin in 2012 [1] ) Piano Man, its maudlin, repetetive title-track opener seems to express envy for performers without a hit album or record label (\u201cStreetlife serenaders / Have no obligations / Hold no grand illusions\u201d), and who aren\u2019t forced by circumstance to get along with others. If this kind of dyspeptic number is precisely the kind of thing you\u2019d expect to find on the third album by an unpopular recording artist, you might not expect it to be followed by so much more of the same. But the whole record\u2019s grumpy: \u201cLos Angelenos\u201d stands up, and then knocks pissily down, a series of stock figures from Joel\u2019s temporary California home (the rich and the vain; the faded and the stoned). \u201cThe Great Suburban Showdown\u201d tells the story of his flight back east, which he also doesn\u2019t sound too happy about: \u201cDrive into town / When this big bird touches down / I'm only comin' home to say goodbye / Then I'm gone with the wind.\u201d In \u201cRoberta,\u201d he longs for a prostitute (\u201cRoberta, how I've adored you / I'd ask you over but I can't afford you,\u201d a rhyme of which you can sense the young Joel feeling inordinately proud) and in \u201cThe Entertainer\u201d he vilifies his label for a radio edit that took \u201cPiano Man,\u201d a five-minute song that\u2019s two minutes too long, and \u201ccut it down to 3:05.\u201d In Joel\u2019s defense, Streetlife Serenade was recorded under pressure from the label; the artist admits it\u2019s no good. \u201cI did not have enough time to write new material,\u201d he told Baldwin. \u201cI had nothin\u2019. I was empty.\u201d He agrees with me that the two best tracks on it are instrumentals. But perhaps Streetlife Serenade is the ur-flop that ignited my lifelong obsession with bad work by people I otherwise admire. The satisfaction one derives from an indisputably successful book or album or film is sweet, to be sure, but sometimes it strikes me as rote, unimaginative. In the case of Joel\u2019s ill-fated third album, anger and jealousy are the engines of failure. To see Joel so hopping mad, and so openly uninspired, was fascinating to my 14-year-old self. As a young songwriter, I would happily scratch out a couple of awful songs exclusively for the empty satisfaction of watching the notebook pages fill up, and the A\u2019s I was earning in English class were less the result of genuine effort than of self-satisfied, condescending cleverness. My teachers were, of course, onto me and my fundamental laziness, but they gave me the grades anyway \u2013 not, perhaps, unhatefully \u2013 and with those grades I was pathetically content, even proud. The spectacle of Billy Joel sucking was a kind of anti-inspiration, justification for my own dazzling mediocrity. (I\u2019d like to think that, these days, my persistent affection for others\u2019 failures springs from someplace less callow, more collegial. But probably not.) Side 2 of my Maryland van tape, however, was a different story. 1976\u2019s Turnstiles contained some actual terrific songs, including \u201cSay Goodbye to Hollywood\u201d (not a hit then, not yet; it would come to greater fame in a live, or pseudo-live, rendition five years later on Songs in the Attic) and my personal favorite, the awkwardly titled \u201cMiami 2017 (I\u2019ve Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway).\u201d The song opens with a fade-in of emergency sirens and pretty piano arpeggios, then tells the story New York City\u2019s eventual destruction and abandonment; the swelling chords give way to a Springsteenian (or at least Rick-Springfeldian) guitar rave-up narrated by haunting vocals rendered otherworldly by a bit of slapback delay. Throw in a couple of breakdowns with kick and crash on the ones, and a trilling piano coda, and boy howdy, you had my attention. I still love it. Joel called it a science-fiction song, but its melding of the fantastical and terrifying with the mundane (it\u2019s not like the world is ending, everybody just moved to Florida) feels more like a kind of speculative, real-estate-fueled dirty realism. [2] The rest of Turnstiles is pretty good, too. \u201cNew York State of Mind\u201d is perhaps the closest thing to a nightclub standard Joel has written (don\u2019t you dare say \u201cBaby Grand\u201d), and \u201cJames\u201d is a nice proto-\u201cJust-the-Way-You-Are\u201d ballad, in the same way that \u201cPrelude / Angry Young Man\u201d takes a few first steps, with its soundtracky dynamic shifts and key changes, toward the bona fide future hit \u201cScenes from an Italian Restaurant.\u201d But can we take a closer look at those last two tracks? Because herein lie some of the strongest signs that Joel\u2019s Streetlife Serende fury has not abated, and might never. If Serenade\u2019s anger largely took the form of vague, embittered longing, this record aims a trembling finger at specific characters, a category I think of as People Who Are Annoying Billy. \u201cJames\u201d complains of a figure from the past, an ambitious rule-follower of the singer\u2019s acquaintance: \u201cI went on the road,\u201d he sings; \u201cyou pursued an education.\u201d Fair enough. From there, though, Joel proceeds to concern-troll the living shit out of this fellow, accusing him of being shallow, cowardly, and \u201cwell-behaved,\u201d before asking him, \u201cWhen will you write your masterpiece?\u201d [3] It\u2019s hard not to read this question as projection. Turnstiles would soon become Joel\u2019s fourth non-hit record, and he had to wonder if Mr. Integrity himself would ever get around to it. Joel still has plenty of vemon left for his \u201cAngry Young Man,\u201d who is no less callow than poor James, this time because of an excess of integrity: \u201cHe refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl / And he\u2019s always at home with his back to the wall.\u201d He\u2019s proud, the Angry Young Man, too proud to do much other than sit around \u201cwith his maps and his medals laid out on the floor.\u201d [4] Is there hope for him? Nope. \u201cHe\u2019ll go to the grave as an angry old man.\u201d At 14, I loved this iteration of Joel. I perceived myself as beset by poseurs, bullies, and dum-dums, and was preparing for my years of rebellion, which lay just ahead. What kind of rebellion, you ask? Oh, sometimes, on the bus between my house and the high school, I would untuck my shirt, and then, six hours later, on the ride home, tuck it back in again. Once, I made out in a movie theater with a girl who smoked cigarettes. I routinely hung out with kids whose parents were divorced, and one time, somebody I was with shoplifted from a convenience store. (I bravely denounced the act.) I was banned from a Perkins restaurant for loud talking. All right, so my rebellion remained imaginary. Maybe it shouldn\u2019t have. Maybe I should have joined my date for cigarettes, untucked my shirt before I left the house. 1984 was the year of Van Halen \u2013 a de-fanged, relatively demure Van Halen, at that \u2013 but their unbridled sexuality and scarved-and-spandexed stage acrobatics weren\u2019t to my taste. [5] No, it was terror of my own desires that compelled me to prefer the virtuosic, nearly decade-old snit-rock of Turnstiles , even though, if I\u2019d been honest with myself, I would have had to admit that I was James and James was I: conventionally ambitious, deeply concerned about what other people thought of me, hungry for the approval of my superiors. My anger, such as it was, I now read as having been in response not to the people who expected great things of me, but from my own complicity in their expectations. They just wanted the best! And I was the coward who accepted their notion of what that was. * In the early eighties, where I grew up anyway, there were two kinds of musicians. There was the kind who, when they wanted to learn to play a song, would listen carefully to it over and over, wearing out the record if necessary, or, if they didn\u2019t have any money to buy the record, waiting until it came on the radio (nightly \u201ctop ten at ten\u201d radio broadcasts made this easier than it sounds), and banging away at it until they figured it out by ear. The name for this kind of musician was \u201cactual musician,\u201d or, simply, \u201cmusician.\u201d I was the other kind, the kind who, when they wanted to learn a new song, went to the music store ( not the record store, mind you) and bought the sheet music. The band I was in at the time was packed with this kind of musician, that is, \u201cnon-musician.\u201d We practiced at Dennis\u2019s house, and I played Dennis\u2019s mom\u2019s electric piano. We mostly performed our own rudimentary tunes, but one of the covers we did was Huey Lewis and the News\u2019 \u201cThe Power of Love,\u201d a very easy track with no changes in key or tempo. And yet I had the sheet music for it. [6] I also had the sheet music for \u201cChariots of Fire,\u201d the \u201cHill Street Blues\u201d theme, and of course plenty of Billy Joel. Age 14, with my rock and roll sheet music My grandparents had arranged for me to take piano lessons, some years before. I had shown an affinity for music, and had been chosen as the Grandchild With Promise, who would be brought up to appreciate the finer things in life. (Indeed, it would be my grandparents who introduced me to New York City, sushi, Philip Roth, jazz, chocolate-covered espresso beans, and fine art.) [7] So my parents bought a piano, which my future indifference to would curdle into guilt every time I walked past the thing, and I began lessons with the stern, patient woman my grandparents had chosen. Mrs. Goldfarb was an amazing player, at least to my inexperienced ear. All I wanted to do at lessons was listen to her play, although to do so, then return to my own halting efforts, was almost unbearable. The piano wasn\u2019t even Mrs. Goldfarb\u2019s main instrument \u2013 she was an even more gifted cellist. Eventually, I would go to hear her play the cello in an orchestra, an experience that demonstrated conclusively to me how hopeless my classical-music aspirations really were, and how undeserving of her attention my playing was. It was a relief, really. I liked classical music, but what I\u2019d cleaved to was pop, and I started rejecting the sonatas Mrs. Goldfarb assigned and began to bring Billy Joel sheet music to lessons, in an effort, I suppose, to convert the poor woman. Watching her tear gamely through \u201cPressure\u201d ( The Nylon Curtain, 1982) felt like a victory at the time but was akin to the last wild weekend of a dying romance: the rush was intense, but once we\u2019d passed the \u201cPressure\u201d horizon, the relationship was dead. I quit lessons soon after. * Joel finally had his smash hit in 1977 with The Stranger. It\u2019s the earliest Joel album I can listen through in its entirety today and pretty much fully enjoy, so long as I am permitted the emotional outlet of eyerolls and deep sighs. Its MO is that of neighborhood tales in the style of Springsteen (more on the Boss-Bard binary later), and the anger has been toned down, unless you count the crypto-sexism of \u201cJust the Way You Are\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s Always a Woman,\u201d passive-aggressive ballads that the record-buying public loved, and still does, in much the same spirit, I guess, that they mistake \u201cEvery Breath You Take,\u201d The Police\u2019s 1983 smash hit about creepy stalking, for a paean to romantic devotion. They also loved \u201cMovin\u2019 Out\u201d and \u201cItalian Restaurant\u201d and \u201cOnly the Good Die Young\u201d (a song my mother, a former Catholic schoolgirl of the very sort the song invites to volunteer for deflowering, detests). But my favorite song on The Stranger is a deep cut, the wistful \u201cVienna,\u201d a kind of anti-\u201cJames\u201d that cheerfuly cautions a headstrong youngster not to sip too eagerly from life\u2019s intoxicating cup. [8] \u201cYou\u2019re so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need,\u201d he sings. \u201cDream on, but don\u2019t imagine they\u2019ll all come true / When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?\u201d This sentiment, that life is long and ample pleasures lay ahead for those willing to wait, seems so unjoelisch that you wonder if he\u2019s been tranquilized or replaced. It\u2019s also a rare appearance of an unguarded Joel that shows no hint of anger or bitterness. Indeed, it\u2019s straight-up sweet, like a Paul McCartney song. Actually, come to think of it, it\u2019s like \u201cHey, Jude.\u201d Which brings me to the elephant in the room, for any aspiring Joelologue: his mid-to-late-career penchant for, even obsession with, imitation. Up through, say, 52ndStreet, we get pretty pure draughts of the man. Sure, he\u2019s a bit more derivative than your average hit machine, but everybody raids the Beatles\u2019 catalog for the occasional minor four or descending chromatic turnaround, and that fact that Joel turns everything into a hammily filligreed jazz number is just part of his avuncular charm. But starting with Glass Houses (his best record, I think), and reaching a horrifying perigee on 1989\u2019s awful Storm Front, we can trace the weird spectacle of Joel trying to out-everybody everybody by at first slyly referencing, then openly acknowledging, then mercilessly copping, specific musicians\u2019 styles. Side one of Glass Houses is a terrific quartet of uptempo rock songs (with a catchy little rhumba, \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Me Why,\u201d wedged into the middle) that begins with the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cStreet Fi \u2014\u201d oh wait, no, that\u2019s \u201cYou May Be Right.\u201d We\u2019ll give that one to Joel; with the seventies drawing to a close and the actual Stones coked up beyond recognition, it was natural to want to inhabit the Stones of 1968, and Joel accomplished it with a fair amount of panache. In the official, live-in-the-studio video for the song, he\u2019s wearing aviator sunglasses and a sport jacket that seems to have been tailored from the remains of the sectional sofa from his grandmother\u2019s half-a-double in Oyster Bay. Joel is sneakered and skinny-tied, and is repping a lot of embarrassingly goofy moves. (He helpfully illustrates the line \u201cEven rode my motorcycle in the rain\u201d by doing a little handlebar dance.) It\u2019s hard not to like him, honestly; he\u2019s trying so hard as, behind him, guitarists David Brown and Russell Javors jointly assume the form of Keith Richards. [9] Side two opens with two Elvis Costello tunes. It\u2019s hard not to hear it, once you\u2019ve noticed. I didn\u2019t, in my adolescence, because I\u2019d never heard of Elvis Costello. (It would take John Frinzi, my first real musician friend and fellow summer janitor at my old elementary school, to turn me on to This Year\u2019s Model, along with H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and The Replacements; he also eventually sold me my first synthesizer.) \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Be Alone Anymore\u201d is a calypsofied \u201cAlison\u201d; \u201cSleeping with the Television On\u201d is \u201cWelcome to the Working Week\u201d with the chorus vocals displaced by half a measure. The Nylon Curtain opens with a fakeout: its only hit, \u201cAllentown,\u201d presented in the mode of Springsteen, with blue-jean-clad working-class rhetoric and manufacturing sound effects, just in case you didn\u2019t get it. [10] But the next eight tunes are pure psychedelic bombast. Joel has said that The Nylon Curtain is his greatest work; I can see him shouting through cupped hands behind the studio glass: \u201cPhil, baby! I think dis is it! I think dis is my Peppah!\u201d But despite one surprisingly good song (\u201cLaura\u201d), it mostly sounds like Joel is covering the post-breakup Fab Four songbook. His masterpiece is, in fact, the shitty Beatles reunion album Mark David Chapman thought he had prevented. Then, of course, comes An Innocent Man; Joel acknowledges that the entire album is a self-conscious homage to the his nineteen-fifties influences. By the time he gets to Storm Front, he\u2019s raiding the R.E.M. catalog: \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\u201d is a kissing \u2013 no, make that a common-law-married \u2013 cousin to \u201cIt\u2019s the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine).\u201d Keep in mind that this man is one of the best-selling solo artists of all time. He has sold more records than Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, and Prince. He does not have to imitate Elvis Costello and R.E.M. (\u201cAt least you\u2019re rippin\u2019 off the greats,\u201d Alec Baldwin quips, 47 minutes into the podcast interview.) Indeed, he has sold, to this day, more records than Springsteen. * I am convinced that if there were no Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel would still be writing and recording studio albums. Contemporaries, geographically proximate, near-twins in class and stature, the two men should really not have been able to maintain parellel careers in the arena of piano-, guitar-, and saxophone-based rock music. Somehow, though, for twenty years, they managed. Or, Joel did, in any event. Springsteen merely lived his life as though Billy Joel didn\u2019t exist. But I believe that Springsteen was Joel\u2019s Kryptonite. [11] There were always some similarities in the music, of course, especially in the early days, when Sprinsteen\u2019s records had more piano on them. But ultimately, the Boss (and how Joel must have longed to be so nicknamed by his adoring fans) chose the guitar, and Joel stayed behind the piano. [12] That is, he usually stayed behind the piano. I can think of one notable exception. It\u2019s the moment that marks, I contend, the beginning of the end of Joel\u2019s recording career, a moment when he made the error of openly acknowledging his rivalry with Springsteen. It is embarrassing to watch, and you can watch it right now. It\u2019s the video for \u201cA Matter of Trust.\u201d The video opens with a descending crane shot of an ordinary summer\u2019s day in New York: pedestrians strolling down a faux East Village sidewalk, unaware that one of pop\u2019s brightest stars is mere feet away. Cut to an interior: a spacious practice room that is obviously a soundstage, with French windows offering views of the street. Joel is giving orders. \u201cFirst two chords are open fifths,\u201d he tells the piano player. \u201cSecond two chords are open fifths.\u201d (The piano player does not, for some reason, reply, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying it\u2019s all open fifths. Why not just say it\u2019s all open fifths?\u201d) Wait, did I just say piano player? That can\u2019t be! Billy is the piano player! Not this time, friend. Billy\u2019s on guitar: a suspiciously pristine Gibson Les Paul Goldtop. \u201cOkay, girls!\u201d he calls out to the band, none of whom are women. \u201cMatter a Trust!\u201d He makes a Spinal Tap joke to no one in particular, then counts in [13] and starts the song. Cut to the street. Muffled by the closed French doors, the music barely registers on the jaded pedestrians. This won\u2019t do. Inside, Billy stops playing. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot in here!\u201d he says. \u201cCould you guys open the windows?\u201d Windows open, the song begins again. Reaction shots: heads turn, shoulders twitch. Now, what have we here? we\u2019re meant to believe these people are thinking. That voice...that sound. This is no mere noise; it\u2019s the unmistakeable sonic footprint of one of America\u2019s most beloved rock stars. It\u2019s the great Billy Joel! Heads poke out of doorways, men in undershirts peer down from fire escapes. Cops bark orders into walkie-talkies. A lady in a housecoat leans out a tenement window and shouts, \u201cShut up!\u201d Back inside, a beautiful woman and an adorable child have suddenly entered the practice space! Could that be supermodel Christie Brinkley, Joel\u2019s then-wife who apparently had nothing better to do, and their two-year-old daughter Alexa? Yes, it could! For context, this video was produced just a few years after Springsteen\u2019s most iconic filmed appearance, the video for his hit \u201cDancing in the Dark.\u201d Lip-synced in front of what appears to be a real concert audience, a Springsteen uncharacteristically unburdened by his own signature instrument, the guitar, pulls an \u201canonymous fan\u201d up from the crowd. It\u2019s actually the actress Courtney Cox, sporting a fetchingly short haircut and a sleeveless Springsteen tour tee shirt, and she chastely jitterbugs onstage with Springsteen as Clarence Clemons pretends to serenade them with the song\u2019s famous saxophone outro. The video is pretty goofy, but it\u2019s still exciting to watch, mostly due to Springsteen\u2019s seemingly effortless sexiness and self-confidence, Cox\u2019s fresh-faced beauty, and a general air of straightforward American romance and fun. At one point Springsteen hazards a knowing glance at the camera, as if to say, Yeah, this stuff\u2019s pretty stupid, but we\u2019re all havin\u2019 a good time! There\u2019s nothing complicated about the video: the camera stays on Springsteen the whole time, reveling in his moves, his rolled-up sleeves, his tight jeans. There is one subject, one plotline. Compare and contrast with the \u201cMatter of Trust\u201d video, which, as the title implies, has no trust whatsoever in the charisma of its star. It cannot resist turning Joel\u2019s practice session into a spontaneously transcendent Genuine New York City Street Event, featuring every imaginable stock urban character, and the results are confusing and embarrassing. Continuity errors abound: the SM57 microphone Joel is singing into is positioned at a different angle in every shot, and usually points somewhere between up Joel\u2019s nose and directly at the ceiling; [14] in the crane shots, the crowd is kept far back from the windows, but the interior shots have them pouring through. Joel\u2019s sweat looks like Vaseline, and his Les Paul, we can see in one closeup, is actually autographed by Les Paul. Setting aside the plausbility of anyone playing a rock show, let alone practicing, with a Les Paul that Les Paul has signed, let me say that there is nothing in the world more inherently, appallingly perverse and fake than an autographed electric guitar. Any famous musician who signs one is effectively consigning it to death inside a wall-mounted plexiglas vitrine. And try to imagine Springsteen playing a guitar another musician has autographed. I mean, please. That said, it\u2019s possible to imagine these two videos inhabiting the same contiguous universe, wherein Springsteen puts the guitar down for a moment to film the \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d video, and Joel, sensing an opportunity, snatches it and runs away. But it\u2019s the evidently pointless presence of Brinkley and daughter that really brings Joel\u2019s Springstenvy into focus. It\u2019s not enough that Joel is saying, through this video, Hey, I can play guitar too! Hey, people are cheering for me, too!! He\u2019s also saying, Hey look! I can attract a hot woman too! I actually married one! In fact, I fucked her! The baby is the proof! This wasn\u2019t the last Billy Joel record or video, of course. But it\u2019s the beginning of the end. The hellhound\u2019s on his trail. His marriage and recording career both have about six years left to go. * But who am I to talk? As I write, my own marriage is now in its latter stages of unraveling, and I feel, as I always do, [15] that the death blow to my career is just around the corner. Look, we\u2019re all going to die and be forgotten. I know that. It\u2019s not like I expect, or even want, my work to last forever. But I don\u2019t wish to live out my productive years in a state of terror of the inevitable. Billy Joel didn\u2019t just want to live, he wanted to win, and to stay on top. More importantly, he wanted to be legit, and to enjoy his legitimacy like a seasoned pro. And man, that shit is stressful. The literary figure Joel most resembles is Stephen King, a man once so dissatisfied by his own massive success that he generated a pseudonym to prove to himself he could become famous all over again. It worked, of course. King\u2019s lifelong and embarrassingly obvious longing for approval from the muck-a-mucks at universities, manifest in his tiresome mockery, in his work, of professors, intellectuals, and other cultural authorities, is akin to Joel\u2019s habit of augmenting his songs with snippets of classical piano, as though to remind his listeners he\u2019s no dummy, unlike certain people he could name. [16] Like Joel, King tried to quit writing; but unlike Joel\u2019s retirement, King\u2019s didn\u2019t take. Joel did release one more studio record after his ostensible 1993 swan song, River of Dreams; it\u2019s a collection of neoclassical pieces performed by a legitimately trained pianist, and is called, wincingly, Fantasies and Delusions. I moved back to the northeast in 1997, after a four-year exile to Montana, where I had studied writing and written my first book, where I met my now-soon-to-be-ex-wife, and where we produced our first child. Before settling in upstate New York, where today we live in separate households, we spent a couple of months in my home town. I\u2019d seen my grandfather during my years away, of course, but not in the context of his day-to-day life as a minor local celebrity, a condition that had seemed to me inviolable. But like I said, nothing lasts forever. We went out to eat, and people didn\u2019t know who he was. One day I was giving him a ride in the dented and rusted Toyota my wife and I had hauled east behind our rental truck, and something gave way; the car bucked and juddered and ground to a halt on some side street in downtown Easton. Pop Pop\u2019s disappointment in me was palpable: driving good cars and maintaining them was a family value I\u2019d failed to inherit. Indeed, I\u2019d long felt a little hurt about never being the one my grandfather asked to drive him around on his gray-market errands, this job typically falling to my more automotively responsible father and brother. I wasn\u2019t sure why I\u2019d been recruited this time around, but I had clearly blown it. I apologized profusely, said I\u2019d call Triple A. Pop Pop stopped me. Don\u2019t, he said. He had a guy. His guy would come. The implication was that the guy would fix the car gratis. He gave me a name and number, and I found a pay phone and called Pop\u2019s guy. \u201cI\u2019m with Doc Stein,\u201d I said. \u201cMy car broke down.\u201d The guy didn\u2019t know who I meant, not at first. But eventually I made him understand, and my father came to pick us up. The car was fixed, eventually, but the work was shoddy and the repair cost $900. My grandfather lived out most of his declining years in Florida, contentedly listening to Danielle Steel audiobooks. Once, I flew there from Ithaca, mistakenly believing that his death was imminent. My grandmother and I sat by his bedside, waiting. At one point, he gestured to me with a trembling finger. Come closer, he seemed to be saying. I took his hand, leaned over the bed. He tilted his face up to my ear, the plastic oxygen tubes creaking and stretching. What would he say? I wondered. What dark truths might he reveal? A family lineage mystery? A secret crime? The true origins of the Remington cowboy? Through cracked lips, he whispered, \u201cBring me...some lemonnnn...icccccce.\u201d * \u201cSome people think it\u2019s because I\u2019m lazy or I\u2019m just being contrary,\u201d Joel told The New Yorker \u2019s Nick Paumgartner in 2014 , on the subject of his apparent retirement from recording. \u201cBut, no, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 I\u2019ve had my say.\u201d He went on, though, contradicting himself: \u201cYou can\u2019t create something that\u2019s an independent entity, made out of whole cloth. They know who you\u2019re in a relationship with, what your past is. They tend to draw their own conclusions. Your image becomes more powerful than the things you create.\u201d The \u201cthey\u201d Joel refers to is his audience: his fans and, of course, his detractors. (I\u2019m mildly ashamed to be both: sometimes a fan, sometimes a detractor, always ashamed.) The \u201cyou\u201d he refers to is, of course, himself. It isn\u2019t surprising that Joel employs the universalizing second person here; he wants to think of his decision to stop recording as inevitable, the kind of thing that just happens when anyone finds themselves in his situation. But the fact is, many artists \u2013 the ones who keep working \u2013 don\u2019t see themselves this way. It\u2019s not necessary to see oneself this way. You can create something out of whole cloth, primarily for yourself, without regard for how it will be received. And it\u2019s possible to think about your audience without making assumptions about what they think about you. But Joel\u2019s not that kind of artist. \u201cLong ago,\u201d Paumgartner writes, \u201cJoel grew tired of having to look out at the fat cats in the two front rows...guys who\u2019d bought the best seats and then sat there projecting a look of impatience and boredom.\u201d So nowadays, those seats aren\u2019t sold to the public, and before each show, the crew hand-picks pretty girls from \u201cthe cheap seats\u201d to occupy them. Joel\u2019s songs were extensions of his inner adolescent, his bullied and wounded self. His most honest music \u2013 not the pastiches, not the bombast, the good stuff \u2013 drew upon his insecurities and, unfortunately, his anger. It isn\u2019t surprising that so many of his most passionate fans are people who never grew up, people who remind Joel of the self he wants to leave behind. It must have gotten harder and harder to be honest, the more successful he became: all the cheers did was remind him of who he wished he no longer was. Nowadays Joel plays it safe: his primary language is shtick. He\u2019s got a canned speech for every number, he\u2019s got his jokes and his funny voices. He\u2019s got his motorcycles and his boat and his dog, and people bring him lemon ice whenever he wants it. * A meme of recent years invited us to identify our \u201cspirit animal.\u201d My understanding of the term is as a pseudo-shamanistic appropriation, a kind of casual embrace of the familiar spirits of European folklore: supernatural entities in animal form that guide us in our metaphysical pursuits. I guess we\u2019re supposed to feel, whenever we\u2019re doing our thing, whether it\u2019s writing a novel or making a record or roofing or plumbing or whatever, some ineffable bear power or bee power or elk power that is meant to motivate and define us. It feels like an empty exercise to me, but OK, fine. Just let me ask you this. Does it have to be an animal? I mean, can it be another human? Can it be Billy Joel? Because I think my spirit animal is him. Or, to frame it as a different pass\u00e9 cultural phenomenon, it\u2019s like I\u2019m wearing a bracelet that reads What Would Billy Do? I don\u2019t usually behave like Billy, at least I don\u2019t think I do, but sometimes my every action feels like a reaction to him. Responding to professional rejection with nervous laughter and awkward standup patter. Finding solace in the creation and dissemination of insecure novelty art. Fucking up my marriage. I don\u2019t want to do those things, and I don\u2019t want to be the person who has done them. But I guess there\u2019s a limit to how much we can subvert or sublimate our essential nature. Billy Joel is the poster child for this disappointing epiphany: he\u2019s never not Billy Joel to the hilt. At times, I envy him his big, irritating, sloppy personality, his unabashed embrace of his own worst qualities. And honestly, would you want him to be any different? I wouldn\u2019t have wanted my grandfather to be any different, either, although he and I share a few flaws: hedonistic urges, fiscal profligacy, marital disharmony. He wasn\u2019t actually my grandfather, by the way. My biological grandfather was a physical and psychological abuser whom my grandmother wisely divorced in her early thirties \u2014 not an easy thing for a woman to do at that time, or at any time, I guess. But Pop Pop is the grandfather who was actually there for me, and I will admit inheritance of his foibles without shame, even as, every day, I endeavor to tamp down the impatience and anger that is my genetic heritage. I need to believe that a good person can sometimes do stupid things or produce shitty work. I have, after all, to protect my show. And yes, I proudly claim Billy Joel as an influence, too. Maybe the most important one, who knows. He\u2019s with me every time I try to amuse my children\u2019s friends with a dumb joke, every time I lose my cool, every time I recycle my own ideas or somebody else\u2019s, or otherwise make an ass of myself, and I guess even when I manage to do something pretty good. My first act, upon moving into the divorced-dad condo that is now my home, was to buy a used LP of Glass Houses and give it a spin. Billy Joel is the clown prince of my middle age. He is driving, for better or worse, the brown borrowed van to Baltimore that is my adult life, and riding the brakes all the way. NOTES [1] How on earth did this extraordinary cultural artifact, a WNYC-produced podcast interview between Joel his fellow Long Islander, escape my attention for the first three years of its existence? The two men engage in almost unbearably chummy mugging and riffing, telling jokes, doing funny voices, and belting out \u201cIn A Gadda-Da-Vida,\u201d and Baldwin can\u2019t resist subtly undermining the great troubaour, needling him about his height and, at one point, correcting his word choice and usage. Anyway, Joel disabuses listeners of the idea the \u201cPiano Man\u201d was, in fact, a hot unit: \u201cPeople perceive that to be a hit. It was not a hit [...] It was a turntable hit. It didn\u2019t sell through.\u201d [2] It now seems inevitable that President Donald Trump should take office in the song\u2019s titular year. Damn you, Billy Joel. [3] At a concert at Hobart and William Smith college in 1996, a fan asked Joel if the song was inspired by a real person. The character, Joel replied, is a composite. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda preachy, judgemental,\u201d he admits, then adds, channeling This Is Spinal Tap, that the music is written \u201cin the style of Bach.\u201d [4] Maps, Billy? The kind you need while crossing America on...a rock and roll tour? And these medals: do they gleam? Are they twelve inches round? Level with us, Billy...are they gold records? [5] A few years ago, my then-adolescent daughter tried to start her first rock band. The guitarist, an eleven-year-old, came over, lifted a gleaming Les Paul out of its case, and tore into a quite convincing rendition of \u201cHot for Teacher.\u201d The band didn\u2019t work out. Oh, my child, fruit of my loins, I am so sorry. [6] While writing this, I became convinced I was making it up. Could there have been a market, in 1986, for such a thing? I looked on the internet, though, and there it was: a simple white booklet bearing the band\u2019s name in drop-shadowed red sans-serif, a rakishly angled live shot of Lewis singing in an era-appropriate blousy geometric print shirt, and the iconic logo of the film Back to the Future, which featured the song. [7] My grandparents also inadvertently introduced me to MTV, which had become available on their side of the river in Pennsylvania years before it arrived on mine in New Jersey. I\u2019m sure my grandfather longed for me to associate his home primarily with Pablo Picasso and the Modern Jazz Quartet, but Omni and MTV are the things that stuck. [8] \u201cYou're so ambitious for a juvenile,\u201d the singer observes, as though his interlocutor were an underaged criminal offender or a rare species of eagle. Give Joel the choice between a rhyme and a coherent English sentence and he\u2019ll pick the rhyme every time. [9] Although, Stones snark aside, I think Joel is pretty coked up at this juncture, too. There\u2019s another video, \u201cAll for Leyna,\u201d that appears to be drawn from this same filming session, but the studio recording is dubbed over it \u2014 Joel is just acting too ridiculous in it to have managed a competent performance of the song. It opens with him slowly rising, like a bug-eyed prairie dog, from underneath his enormous electric piano and synthesizer, and is punctuated throughout by wacky hand motions and Cosbyesque fourth-wall penetration. These antics ought to be anathema to the song\u2019s histrionics, yet it all feels of a piece somehow. [10] The Nylon Curtain is merely the worst offender in a recording career refulgent with pointed foley work: in this case, industrial clanking and heavy workingman\u2019s breathing on \u201cAllentown,\u201d crickets and thudding synthesized helicopter rotors on \u201cGoodnight, Saigon\u201d (making it sound more like a hospital parking lot in New Jersey, frankly, than a war zone in southeast Asia), and Swedish travel announcements in \u201cScandinavian Skies,\u201d because, I guess, the title alone isn\u2019t adequately persuasive? None of this, however, can top, for sheer redundancy, the shattering glass sound at the beginning of Glass Houses, cleverly placed to clarify the message conveyed by both the front and back cover images, and by the title, so that it is impossible to miss the ludicrous clich\u00e9 that is the album\u2019s guiding metaphor. [11] My friend and bandmate Adam O\u2019Fallon Price, via email: \u201cSpringsteen so successfully and adroitly molded his persona, and with BJ it always sounds so forced and difficult. There's such a weight of insecurity with him, this palpable fear of being exposed as this little Bridge and Tunnel chump. [...] I guess I prefer Springsteen's music, but I definitely prefer BJ as a literary character. He's like the Hamlet of successful rock musicians.\u201d [12] At the keyboard, no one can tell how tall you are. [13] This is starting to feel like nitpicking now, but it\u2019s worth pointing out that Joel actually sings the count-in. It\u2019s hard to explain to non-musicians how cringeworthy this is. Even including a spoken count-in on a studio recording is in questionable taste (full disclosure: yes, of course I\u2019ve done it), but to assign notes to the count-in, and full-throatedly sing them, is a uniquely Joelian bit of rock-insider foregrounding. [14] In an ominous prefiguring of Joel\u2019s impending onstage freakout in Moscow, he actually, near the video\u2019s end, knocks the mic stand to the floor. Of course it\u2019s magically standing again a few seconds later, when Joel turns away from it to attempt his own, highly awkward, direct communion with the camera. [15] As, I suppose, everyone does. [16] \u201cMe as Tchaikovsky!\u201d he says to Baldwin in the WYNC interview, banging out the opening synth line to \u201cPressure\u201d on the piano. Later he plays \u201cThis Night\u201d and remarks, \u201cYou\u2019ll recognize the chorus... which is the Pathetique, by Beethoven!\u201d On the liner notes of An Innocent Man, Joel gives \u201cL. V. Beethoven\u201d co-writing credit for the song.",

The tour was being recorded and filmed, in an effort not only to preserve these historic shows for posterity, but to recoup the tour\u2019s exorbitant costs. Joel was not accustomed to Soviet audiences; they didn\u2019t react to his hits with the same enthusiasm his American fans did. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/28/arts/billy-joel-has-a-tantrum.html\" target=\"_blank\">He would later tell a <em>New York Times</em> reporter</a> that the unresponsive crowd at his July 27 Moscow show was akin to \u201can oil painting.\u201d \u201cI've been on the road for 11 months,\u201d he went on, by way of explaining what was about to happen. \u201cIt's difficult.

At one point, during his song \u201cIt\u2019s Just a Fantasy,\u201d Joel began to lose his temper.</p><p class=\"\">There is a video of this moment on YouTube. Between sung lines, Joel shouts at the crew: \u201cStop it! Leave me alone!\u201d Finally, exasperated, he screams, \u201cLet me do my show, for chrissake!\u201d and he tips over his electric piano, which crashes noisily to the floor. The YouTube video cuts some seconds ahead; now Joel\u2019s downstage, a microphone stand in his hands. He raises it above his head and smashes it repeatedly into a stage monitor, while the band plays on behind him. When a cameraman gets too close, Joel goes after him. The cameraman turns and runs, but it\u2019s too late: Joel kicks him in the ass.</p><p class=\"\">\u201cIt was a real prima donna act,\u201d Joel later admitted to the <em>Times</em> reporter. \u201cBut I have to protect my show.\u201d</p><p class=\"\">*</p><p class=\"\">In the fall of 1983, my grandfather volunteered to drive us all down to Annapolis to watch the Lafayette College football team play against Navy.

If Easton ever had a heyday, it was long past by 1984; it\u2019s one of those towns near enough to New York and Philadelphia to get mired in their effluvia (drugs, poverty, race and class tension), but not close enough to appeal to commuters, or at least the kind of commuters who can stand spending most of their time at home. My grandfather (Robert Stein was his name) was the resident physician at Lafayette, presiding over its student health center and serving as a perpetual sideline presence, stethoscope hung around his neck, at scholastic sporting events. The sight of him running out onto the field when a player got hurt is one of the signature dramatic motifs of my childhood, and one probable reason that my congenital disdain for organized sports remained latent for so long.</p><p class=\"\">Pop Pop was gruff, brooding, mercurial, yet capable of great kindness and generosity. He was also, insofar as this was possible in Easton, a player. He liked to be at the center of things. (His conquest of my grandmother, his rather younger secretary, must certainly have been one of the great social triumphs of his life. I have a photo of them dancing at my parents\u2019 wedding; in it, my grandmother, prematurely silver-haired at 41, is undeniably, devastatingly hot, and my grandfather gazes at her with an expression of giddy, almost unhinged and triumphant love. It was the second and last marriage for both of them.) He also liked to spend money. Objects of mysterious origin routinely appeared in my grandparents\u2019 home, fancy things: obscure and delectable chocolates, the two-inch-thick steaks we ate on Sunday afternoons, bottles of liquor backlit by the deluxe wet bar cleverly built into a hallway of their apartment. Doc Stein collected art, too: I\u2019ve got the Dali now, and Mom\u2019s got the Picasso, and none of us are quite sure what to do about the Frederic Remington bronze cowboy that may or may not have been stolen from a museum in Newark.</p><p class=\"\">My grandfather tended to keep mum about where he got stuff, in part, I think, in order to cultivate an air of mysteriousness and power (he wouldn\u2019t, for instance, let me bring home copies of <em>Omni</em> magazine from the apartment to read, making it clear that he and he alone was their keeper, and that I enjoyed them exclusively at his pleasure), and in part because a lot of it came from local mobsters. He was their doctor; he didn\u2019t charge them, and was remunerated in goods and favors. (Thus the Remington, and the fact that, in those days, I never once saw him pay for a meal in an Italian restaurant.) Indeed, this is how my grandfather preferred to do business: he was a handshake deal kind of guy. So he didn\u2019t rent a van the day we went to Maryland: he sourced one. From a friend who owed him a favor.</p><p class=\"\">The van was awesome. I would love to have it now. It was brown, brown, brown, like a mashup of nineteen-seventies kitchen appliances, and plushly accoutered inside, with leather-upholstered seats and carpeting that I remember as thick pile but was probably not. The point is this, though: my leadfooted grandfather rode the brakes all the way to Maryland, wearing them down to the metal, and we ended up pulling into a suburban mechanic\u2019s garage somewhere outside Baltimore, wreathed in a cloud of acrid smoke. Nobody owed my grandfather any favors here; he and my father had to prod and cajole the mechanic into finding the parts he needed and prioritizing our repair over that of his regular customers.</p><p class=\"\">Even so, we were stuck for a long time, and that van, its back doors open to the balmy fall air, became the crucible of my future adult self. I got angry back there, with my books and tapes and boredom, far from my witty Dungeons and Dragons friends and brutally terrible rock band. I hated football, I realized; I hated road trips, I hated everyone. Familial pressure to attend college (an inevitability I passionately advocated for, yet still somehow managed to resent) was stirring; there would be, post-brake-replacement, many unsubtle hints that perhaps I would enjoy attending the Naval Academy. During those unseasonably warm suburban Maryland hours, my petty resentments would catch fire and begin to change form. Those moments were remaking me into, god forbid, a sort of almost near-man.</p><p class=\"\">I have no recollection of what I was reading that day, but I sure remember the soundtrack. I had one cassette in my Walkman, a Maxell XLII-S90, which I had impregnated with two LP\u2019s not long before (while sitting perfectly still at the dining room table, obnoxiously policing my family so that their heavy footsteps wouldn\u2019t rumble or stutter the vinyl): Billy Joel\u2019s <em>Turnstiles</em> and Billy Joel\u2019s <em>Streetlife Serenade.</em></p><p class=\"\">*</p><p class=\"\">Even within the confines of this exercise, wherein I cast my mind back to an era when, free from the contextualizing influence of rock history that now prevents me from unironically enjoying the music of Billy Joel [2025 note: I\u2019m over it, I can just enjoy him now], I cannot say that I ever regarded <em>Streetlife Serenade</em> as a good album. The follow-up to his waltz-in-limericks hit (or, non-hit, as Joel <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/heresthething/episodes/225651-billy-joel\" target=\"_blank\">told actor Alec Baldwin</a> in 2012<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[1]</a>) <em>Piano Man, </em>its maudlin, repetetive title-track opener seems to express envy for performers without a hit album or record label (\u201cStreetlife serenaders / Have no obligations / Hold no grand illusions\u201d), and who aren\u2019t forced by circumstance to get along with others. If this kind of dyspeptic number is precisely the kind of thing you\u2019d expect to find on the third album by an unpopular recording artist, you might not expect it to be followed by so much more of the same. But the whole record\u2019s grumpy: \u201cLos Angelenos\u201d stands up, and then knocks pissily down, a series of stock figures from Joel\u2019s temporary California home (the rich and the vain; the faded and the stoned). \u201cThe Great Suburban Showdown\u201d tells the story of his flight back east, which he also doesn\u2019t sound too happy about: \u201cDrive into town / When this big bird touches down / I'm only comin' home to say goodbye / Then I'm gone with the wind.\u201d In \u201cRoberta,\u201d he longs for a prostitute (\u201cRoberta, how I've adored you / I'd ask you over but I can't afford you,\u201d a rhyme of which you can sense the young Joel feeling inordinately proud) and in \u201cThe Entertainer\u201d he vilifies his label for a radio edit that took \u201cPiano Man,\u201d a five-minute song that\u2019s two minutes too long, and \u201ccut it down to 3:05.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1087\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50e08e65e4b0c2f4976972df/7c5ed320-9313-4802-a4f7-65a7c33343c4/streetlife.jpg?format=1000w\" width=\"1100\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">In Joel\u2019s defense, <em>Streetlife Serenade</em> was recorded under pressure from the label; the artist admits it\u2019s no good. \u201cI did not have enough time to write new material,\u201d he told Baldwin. \u201cI had nothin\u2019.

The satisfaction one derives from an indisputably successful book or album or film is sweet, to be sure, but sometimes it strikes me as rote, unimaginative. In the case of Joel\u2019s ill-fated third album, anger and jealousy are the engines of failure. To see Joel so hopping mad, and so openly uninspired, was fascinating to my 14-year-old self. As a young songwriter, I would happily scratch out a couple of awful songs exclusively for the empty satisfaction of watching the notebook pages fill up, and the A\u2019s I was earning in English class were less the result of genuine effort than of self-satisfied, condescending cleverness. My teachers were, of course, onto me and my fundamental laziness, but they gave me the grades anyway \u2013 not, perhaps, unhatefully \u2013 and with those grades I was pathetically content, even proud. The spectacle of Billy Joel sucking was a kind of anti-inspiration, justification for my own dazzling mediocrity.

Throw in a couple of breakdowns with kick and crash on the ones, and a trilling piano coda, and boy howdy, you had my attention.</p><p class=\"\">I still love it. Joel called it a science-fiction song, but its melding of the fantastical and terrifying with the mundane (it\u2019s not like the world is ending, everybody just moved to Florida) feels more like a kind of speculative, real-estate-fueled dirty realism.<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[2]</a></p><p class=\"\">The rest of <em>Turnstiles</em> is pretty good, too. \u201cNew York State of Mind\u201d is perhaps the closest thing to a nightclub standard Joel has written (don\u2019t you <em>dare</em> say \u201cBaby Grand\u201d), and \u201cJames\u201d is a nice proto-\u201cJust-the-Way-You-Are\u201d ballad, in the same way that \u201cPrelude / Angry Young Man\u201d takes a few first steps, with its soundtracky dynamic shifts and key changes, toward the bona fide future hit \u201cScenes from an Italian Restaurant.\u201d</p><p class=\"\">But can we take a closer look at those last two tracks? Because herein lie some of the strongest signs that Joel\u2019s <em>Streetlife Serende</em> fury has not abated, and might never. If <em>Serenade\u2019s</em> anger largely took the form of vague, embittered longing, this record aims a trembling finger at specific characters, a category I think of as People Who Are Annoying Billy. \u201cJames\u201d complains of a figure from the past, an ambitious rule-follower of the singer\u2019s acquaintance: \u201cI went on the road,\u201d he sings; \u201cyou pursued an education.\u201d Fair enough. From there, though, Joel proceeds to concern-troll the living shit out of this fellow, accusing him of being shallow, cowardly, and \u201cwell-behaved,\u201d before asking him, \u201cWhen will you write your masterpiece?\u201d<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[3]</a> It\u2019s hard not to read this question as projection. <em>Turnstiles</em> would soon become Joel\u2019s fourth non-hit record, and he had to wonder if Mr. Integrity himself would ever get around to it.</p><p class=\"\">Joel still has plenty of vemon left for his \u201cAngry Young Man,\u201d who is no less callow than poor James, this time because of an excess of integrity: \u201cHe refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl / And he\u2019s always at home with his back to the wall.\u201d He\u2019s proud, the Angry Young Man, too proud to do much other than sit around \u201cwith his maps and his medals laid out on the floor.\u201d<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[4]</a> Is there hope for him? Nope. \u201cHe\u2019ll go to the grave as an angry old man.\u201d</p><p class=\"\">At 14, I loved this iteration of Joel. I perceived myself as beset by poseurs, bullies, and dum-dums, and was preparing for my years of rebellion, which lay just ahead. What kind of rebellion, you ask? Oh, sometimes, on the bus between my house and the high school, I would untuck my shirt, and then, six hours later, on the ride home, tuck it back in again. Once, I made out in a movie theater with a girl who smoked cigarettes. I routinely hung out with kids whose parents were divorced, and one time, somebody I was with shoplifted from a convenience store. (I bravely denounced the act.) I was banned from a Perkins restaurant for loud talking.</p><p class=\"\">All right, so my rebellion remained imaginary. Maybe it shouldn\u2019t have. Maybe I should have joined my date for cigarettes, untucked my shirt <em>before</em> I left the house. 1984 was the year of Van Halen \u2013 a de-fanged, relatively demure Van Halen, at that \u2013 but their unbridled sexuality and scarved-and-spandexed stage acrobatics weren\u2019t to my taste.<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[5]</a> No, it was terror of my own desires that compelled me to prefer the virtuosic, nearly decade-old snit-rock of <em>Turnstiles</em>, even though, if I\u2019d been honest with myself, I would have had to admit that I was James and James was I: conventionally ambitious, deeply concerned about what other people thought of me, hungry for the approval of my superiors. My anger, such as it was, I now read as having been in response not to the people who expected great things of me, but from my own complicity in their expectations. They just wanted the best! And I was the coward who accepted their notion of what that was.</p><p class=\"\">*&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">In the early eighties, where I grew up anyway, there were two kinds of musicians. There was the kind who, when they wanted to learn to play a song, would listen carefully to it over and over, wearing out the record if necessary, or, if they didn\u2019t have any money to buy the record, waiting until it came on the radio (nightly \u201ctop ten at ten\u201d radio broadcasts made this easier than it sounds), and banging away at it until they figured it out by ear.

I had shown an affinity for music, and had been chosen as the Grandchild With Promise, who would be brought up to appreciate the finer things in life. (Indeed, it would be my grandparents who introduced me to New York City, sushi, Philip Roth, jazz, chocolate-covered espresso beans, and fine art.)<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[7]</a> So my parents bought a piano, which my future indifference to would curdle into guilt every time I walked past the thing, and I began lessons with the stern, patient woman my grandparents had chosen.</p><p class=\"\">Mrs. Goldfarb was an amazing player, at least to my inexperienced ear.

The piano wasn\u2019t even Mrs. Goldfarb\u2019s main instrument \u2013 she was an even more gifted cellist. Eventually, I would go to hear her play the cello in an orchestra, an experience that demonstrated conclusively to me how hopeless my classical-music aspirations really were, and how undeserving of her attention my playing was.</p><p class=\"\">It was a relief, really. I liked classical music, but what I\u2019d cleaved to was pop, and I started rejecting the sonatas Mrs. Goldfarb assigned and began to bring Billy Joel sheet music to lessons, in an effort, I suppose, to convert the poor woman. Watching her tear gamely through \u201cPressure\u201d (<em>The Nylon Curtain, </em>1982) felt like a victory at the time but was akin to the last wild weekend of a dying romance: the rush was intense, but once we\u2019d passed the \u201cPressure\u201d horizon, the relationship was dead.

Its MO is that of neighborhood tales in the style of Springsteen (more on the Boss-Bard binary later), and the anger has been toned down, unless you count the crypto-sexism of \u201cJust the Way You Are\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s Always a Woman,\u201d passive-aggressive ballads that the record-buying public loved, and still does, in much the same spirit, I guess, that they mistake \u201cEvery Breath You Take,\u201d The Police\u2019s 1983 smash hit about creepy stalking, for a paean to romantic devotion. They also loved \u201cMovin\u2019 Out\u201d and \u201cItalian Restaurant\u201d and \u201cOnly the Good Die Young\u201d (a song my mother, a former Catholic schoolgirl of the very sort the song invites to volunteer for deflowering, detests). But my favorite song on <em>The Stranger</em> is a deep cut, the wistful \u201cVienna,\u201d a kind of anti-\u201cJames\u201d that cheerfuly cautions a headstrong youngster not to sip too eagerly from life\u2019s intoxicating cup.<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[8]</a> \u201cYou\u2019re so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need,\u201d he sings. \u201cDream on, but don\u2019t imagine they\u2019ll all come true / When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?\u201d</p><p class=\"\">This sentiment, that life is long and ample pleasures lay ahead for those willing to wait, seems so <em>unjoelisch</em> that you wonder if he\u2019s been tranquilized or replaced. It\u2019s also a rare appearance of an unguarded Joel that shows no hint of anger or bitterness. Indeed, it\u2019s straight-up sweet, like a Paul McCartney song. Actually, come to think of it, it\u2019s like \u201cHey, Jude.\u201d</p><p class=\"\">Which brings me to the elephant in the room, for any aspiring Joelologue: his mid-to-late-career penchant for, even obsession with, imitation. Up through, say, <em>52ndStreet,</em> we get pretty pure draughts of the man. Sure, he\u2019s a bit more derivative than your average hit machine, but everybody raids the Beatles\u2019 catalog for the occasional minor four or descending chromatic turnaround, and that fact that Joel turns everything into a hammily filligreed jazz number is just part of his avuncular charm. But starting with <em>Glass Houses</em> (his best record, I think), and reaching a horrifying perigee on 1989\u2019s awful <em>Storm Front,</em> we can trace the weird spectacle of Joel trying to out-everybody everybody by at first slyly referencing, then openly acknowledging, then mercilessly copping, specific musicians\u2019 styles.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50e08e65e4b0c2f4976972df/d2991fcd-373d-4830-994c-cf75dc75c40e/glass.jpg?format=1000w\" width=\"1200\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Side one of <em>Glass Houses </em>is a terrific quartet of uptempo rock songs (with a catchy little rhumba, \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Me Why,\u201d wedged into the middle) that begins with the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cStreet Fi \u2014\u201d oh wait, no, that\u2019s \u201cYou May Be Right.\u201d We\u2019ll give that one to Joel; with the seventies drawing to a close and the actual Stones coked up beyond recognition, it was natural to want to inhabit the Stones of 1968, and Joel accomplished it with a fair amount of panache. In the official, live-in-the-studio video for the song, he\u2019s wearing aviator sunglasses and a sport jacket that seems to have been tailored from the remains of the sectional sofa from his grandmother\u2019s half-a-double in Oyster Bay. Joel is sneakered and skinny-tied, and is repping a lot of embarrassingly goofy moves. (He helpfully illustrates the line \u201cEven rode my motorcycle in the rain\u201d by doing a little handlebar dance.) It\u2019s hard not to like him, honestly; he\u2019s trying <em>so hard</em> as, behind him, guitarists David Brown and Russell Javors jointly assume the form of Keith Richards.<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[9]</a></p><p class=\"\">Side two opens with two Elvis Costello tunes.

(It would take John Frinzi, my first real musician friend and fellow summer janitor at my old elementary school, to turn me on to <em>This Year\u2019s Model,</em> along with H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and The Replacements; he also eventually sold me my first synthesizer.) \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Be Alone Anymore\u201d is a calypsofied \u201cAlison\u201d; \u201cSleeping with the Television On\u201d is \u201cWelcome to the Working Week\u201d with the chorus vocals displaced by half a measure.</p><p class=\"\"><em>The Nylon Curtain</em> opens with a fakeout: its only hit, \u201cAllentown,\u201d presented in the mode of Springsteen, with blue-jean-clad working-class rhetoric and manufacturing sound effects, just in case you didn\u2019t get it.<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[10]</a> But the next eight tunes are pure psychedelic bombast. Joel has said that <em>The Nylon Curtain</em> is his greatest work; I can see him shouting through cupped hands behind the studio glass: \u201cPhil, baby! I think dis is it! I think dis is my <em>Peppah!\u201d</em> But despite one surprisingly good song (\u201cLaura\u201d), it mostly sounds like Joel is covering the post-breakup Fab Four songbook. His masterpiece is, in fact, the shitty Beatles reunion album Mark David Chapman thought he had prevented.</p><p class=\"\">Then, of course, comes <em>An Innocent Man;</em> Joel acknowledges that the entire album is a self-conscious homage to the his nineteen-fifties influences. By the time he gets to <em>Storm Front,</em> he\u2019s raiding the R.E.M. catalog: \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\u201d is a kissing \u2013 no, make that a common-law-married \u2013 cousin to \u201cIt\u2019s the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine).\u201d</p><p class=\"\">Keep in mind that this man is one of the best-selling solo artists <em>of all time.</em> He has sold more records than Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, and Prince. He does not have to imitate Elvis Costello and R.E.M. (\u201cAt least you\u2019re rippin\u2019 off the greats,\u201d Alec Baldwin quips, 47 minutes into the podcast interview.) Indeed, he has sold, to this day, more records than Springsteen.</p><p class=\"\">*</p><p class=\"\">I am convinced that if there were no Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel would still be writing and recording studio albums. Contemporaries, geographically proximate, near-twins in class and stature, the two men should really not have been able to maintain parellel careers in the arena of piano-, guitar-, and saxophone-based rock music. Somehow, though, for twenty years, they managed. Or, Joel did, in any event. Springsteen merely lived his life as though Billy Joel didn\u2019t exist. But I believe that Springsteen was Joel\u2019s Kryptonite.<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[11]</a> There were always some similarities in the music, of course, especially in the early days, when Sprinsteen\u2019s records had more piano on them.

Inside, Billy stops playing. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot in here!\u201d he says. \u201cCould you guys open the windows?\u201d Windows open, the song begins again.</p><p class=\"\">Reaction shots: heads turn, shoulders twitch. <em>Now, what have we here?</em> we\u2019re meant to believe these people are thinking. <em>That voice...that sound. This is no mere noise; it\u2019s the unmistakeable sonic footprint of one of America\u2019s most beloved rock stars. It\u2019s the great Billy Joel!</em> Heads poke out of doorways, men in undershirts peer down from fire escapes. Cops bark orders into walkie-talkies. A lady in a housecoat leans out a tenement window and shouts, \u201cShut up!\u201d Back inside, a beautiful woman and an adorable child have suddenly entered the practice space! Could that be supermodel Christie Brinkley, Joel\u2019s then-wife who apparently had nothing better to do, and their two-year-old daughter Alexa? Yes, it could!</p><p class=\"\">For context, this video was produced just a few years after Springsteen\u2019s most iconic filmed appearance, the video for his hit \u201cDancing in the Dark.\u201d Lip-synced in front of what appears to be a real concert audience, a Springsteen uncharacteristically unburdened by his own signature instrument, the guitar, pulls an \u201canonymous fan\u201d up from the crowd. It\u2019s actually the actress Courtney Cox, sporting a fetchingly short haircut and a sleeveless Springsteen tour tee shirt, and she chastely jitterbugs onstage with Springsteen as Clarence Clemons pretends to serenade them with the song\u2019s famous saxophone outro.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">The video is pretty goofy, but it\u2019s still exciting to watch, mostly due to Springsteen\u2019s seemingly effortless sexiness and self-confidence, Cox\u2019s fresh-faced beauty, and a general air of straightforward American romance and fun. At one point Springsteen hazards a knowing glance at the camera, as if to say, <em>Yeah, this stuff\u2019s pretty stupid, but we\u2019re all havin\u2019 a good time!</em> There\u2019s nothing complicated about the video: the camera stays on Springsteen the whole time, reveling in his moves, his rolled-up sleeves, his tight jeans. There is one subject, one plotline.</p><p class=\"\">Compare and contrast with the \u201cMatter of Trust\u201d video, which, as the title implies, has no trust whatsoever in the charisma of its star. It cannot resist turning Joel\u2019s practice session into a spontaneously transcendent Genuine New York City Street Event, featuring every imaginable stock urban character, and the results are confusing and embarrassing. Continuity errors abound: the SM57 microphone Joel is singing into is positioned at a different angle in every shot, and usually points somewhere between up Joel\u2019s nose and directly at the ceiling;<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[14]</a> in the crane shots, the crowd is kept far back from the windows, but the interior shots have them pouring through. Joel\u2019s sweat looks like Vaseline, and his Les Paul, we can see in one closeup, <em>is actually autographed by Les Paul.</em> Setting aside the plausbility of anyone playing a rock show, let alone practicing, with a Les Paul that Les Paul has signed, let me say that there is nothing in the world more inherently, appallingly perverse and fake than an autographed electric guitar. Any famous musician who signs one is effectively consigning it to death inside a wall-mounted plexiglas vitrine. And try to imagine Springsteen playing a guitar another musician has autographed. I mean, please. That said, it\u2019s possible to imagine these two videos inhabiting the same contiguous universe, wherein Springsteen puts the guitar down for a moment to film the \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d video, and Joel, sensing an opportunity, snatches it and runs away.</p><p class=\"\">But it\u2019s the evidently pointless presence of Brinkley and daughter that really brings Joel\u2019s Springstenvy into focus. It\u2019s not enough that Joel is saying, through this video, <em>Hey, I can play guitar too! Hey, people are cheering for me, too!!</em> He\u2019s also saying, <em>Hey look! I can attract a hot woman too! I actually married one! In fact, I fucked her! The baby is the proof! </em></p><p class=\"\">This wasn\u2019t the last Billy Joel record or video, of course. But it\u2019s the beginning of the end. The hellhound\u2019s on his trail. His marriage and recording career both have about six years left to go.</p><p class=\"\">*</p><p class=\"\">But who am I to talk? As I write, my own marriage is now in its latter stages of unraveling, and I feel, as I always do,<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[15]</a> that the death blow to my career is just around the corner. Look, we\u2019re all going to die and be forgotten. I know that. It\u2019s not like I expect, or even want, my work to last forever. But I don\u2019t wish to live out my productive years in a state of terror of the inevitable. Billy Joel didn\u2019t just want to live, he wanted to win, and to stay on top. More importantly, he wanted to be legit, and to enjoy his legitimacy like a seasoned pro. And man, that shit is stressful. The literary figure Joel most resembles is Stephen King, a man once so dissatisfied by his own massive success that he generated a pseudonym to prove to himself he could become famous all over again. It worked, of course. King\u2019s lifelong and embarrassingly obvious longing for approval from the muck-a-mucks at universities, manifest in his tiresome mockery, in his work, of professors, intellectuals, and other cultural authorities, is akin to Joel\u2019s habit of augmenting his songs with snippets of classical piano, as though to remind his listeners he\u2019s no dummy, unlike certain people he could name.<a href=\"\" title=\"\">[16]</a> Like Joel, King tried to quit writing; but unlike Joel\u2019s retirement, King\u2019s didn\u2019t take. Joel did release one more studio record after his ostensible 1993 swan song, <em>River of Dreams; </em>it\u2019s a collection of neoclassical pieces performed by a legitimately trained pianist, and is called, wincingly, <em>Fantasies and Delusions.</em></p><p class=\"\">I moved back to the northeast in 1997, after a four-year exile to Montana, where I had studied writing and written my first book, where I met my now-soon-to-be-ex-wife, and where we produced our first child. Before settling in upstate New York, where today we live in separate households, we spent a couple of months in my home town.</p><p class=\"\">I\u2019d seen my grandfather during my years away, of course, but not in the context of his day-to-day life as a minor local celebrity, a condition that had seemed to me inviolable. But like I said, nothing lasts forever. We went out to eat, and people didn\u2019t know who he was. One day I was giving him a ride in the dented and rusted Toyota my wife and I had hauled east behind our rental truck, and something gave way; the car bucked and juddered and ground to a halt on some side street in downtown Easton.</p><p class=\"\">Pop Pop\u2019s disappointment in me was palpable: driving good cars and maintaining them was a family value I\u2019d failed to inherit. Indeed, I\u2019d long felt a little hurt about never being the one my grandfather asked to drive him around on his gray-market errands, this job typically falling to my more automotively responsible father and brother. I wasn\u2019t sure why I\u2019d been recruited this time around, but I had clearly blown it. I apologized profusely, said I\u2019d call Triple A.</p><p class=\"\">Pop Pop stopped me. Don\u2019t, he said. He had a guy. His guy would come. The implication was that the guy would fix the car gratis. He gave me a name and number, and I found a pay phone and called Pop\u2019s guy. \u201cI\u2019m with Doc Stein,\u201d I said. \u201cMy car broke down.\u201d The guy didn\u2019t know who I meant, not at first. But eventually I made him understand, and my father came to pick us up.</p><p class=\"\">The car was fixed, eventually, but the work was shoddy and the repair cost $900. My grandfather lived out most of his declining years in Florida, contentedly listening to Danielle Steel audiobooks. Once, I flew there from Ithaca, mistakenly believing that his death was imminent. My grandmother and I sat by his bedside, waiting. At one point, he gestured to me with a trembling finger. Come closer, he seemed to be saying. I took his hand, leaned over the bed. He tilted his face up to my ear, the plastic oxygen tubes creaking and stretching. What would he say? I wondered. What dark truths might he reveal? A family lineage mystery? A secret crime? The true origins of the Remington cowboy?</p><p class=\"\">Through cracked lips, he whispered, \u201cBring me...some lemonnnn...icccccce.\u201d</p><p class=\"\">*</p><p class=\"\">\u201cSome people think it\u2019s because I\u2019m lazy or I\u2019m just being contrary,\u201d Joel <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/billy-joel-profile-thirty-three-hit-wonder\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>The New Yorker</em>\u2019s Nick Paumgartner in 2014</a>, on the subject of his apparent retirement from recording. \u201cBut, no, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 I\u2019ve had my say.\u201d He went on, though, contradicting himself: \u201cYou can\u2019t create something that\u2019s an independent entity, made out of whole cloth. They know who you\u2019re in a relationship with, what your past is. They tend to draw their own conclusions. Your image becomes more powerful than the things you create.\u201d</p><p class=\"\">The \u201cthey\u201d Joel refers to is his audience: his fans and, of course, his detractors. (I\u2019m mildly ashamed to be both: sometimes a fan, sometimes a detractor, always ashamed.) The \u201cyou\u201d he refers to is, of course, himself. It isn\u2019t surprising that Joel employs the universalizing second person here; he wants to think of his decision to stop recording as inevitable, the kind of thing that just happens when anyone finds themselves in his situation. But the fact is, many artists \u2013 the ones who keep working \u2013 don\u2019t see themselves this way. It\u2019s not <em>necessary</em> to see oneself this way. You <em>can</em> create something out of whole cloth, primarily for yourself, without regard for how it will be received. And it\u2019s possible to think about your audience without making assumptions about what they think about you.</p><p class=\"\">But Joel\u2019s not that kind of artist. \u201cLong ago,\u201d Paumgartner writes, \u201cJoel grew tired of having to look out at the fat cats in the two front rows...guys who\u2019d bought the best seats and then sat there projecting a look of impatience and boredom.\u201d So nowadays, those seats aren\u2019t sold to the public, and before each show, the crew hand-picks pretty girls from \u201cthe cheap seats\u201d to occupy them.</p><p class=\"\">Joel\u2019s songs were extensions of his inner adolescent, his bullied and wounded self. His most honest music \u2013 not the pastiches, not the bombast, the good stuff \u2013 drew upon his insecurities and, unfortunately, his anger. It isn\u2019t surprising that so many of his most passionate fans are people who never grew up, people who remind Joel of the self he wants to leave behind. It must have gotten harder and harder to be honest, the more successful he became: all the cheers did was remind him of who he wished he no longer was. Nowadays Joel plays it safe: his primary language is shtick. He\u2019s got a canned speech for every number, he\u2019s got his jokes and his funny voices. He\u2019s got his motorcycles and his boat and his dog, and people bring him lemon ice whenever he wants it.</p><p class=\"\">*</p><p class=\"\">A meme of recent years invited us to identify our \u201cspirit animal.\u201d My understanding of the term is as a pseudo-shamanistic appropriation, a kind of casual embrace of the familiar spirits of European folklore: supernatural entities in animal form that guide us in our metaphysical pursuits. I guess we\u2019re supposed to feel, whenever we\u2019re doing our thing, whether it\u2019s writing a novel or making a record or roofing or plumbing or whatever, some ineffable bear power or bee power or elk power that is meant to motivate and define us.</p><p class=\"\">It feels like an empty exercise to me, but OK, fine. Just let me ask you this. Does it have to be an animal? I mean, can it be another human? Can it be Billy Joel? Because I think my spirit animal is him.</p><p class=\"\">Or, to frame it as a different pass\u00e9 cultural phenomenon, it\u2019s like I\u2019m wearing a bracelet that reads <em>What Would Billy Do?</em> I don\u2019t usually behave like Billy, at least I don\u2019t think I do, but sometimes my every action feels like a reaction to him. Responding to professional rejection with nervous laughter and awkward standup patter. Finding solace in the creation and dissemination of insecure novelty art. Fucking up my marriage.</p><p class=\"\">I don\u2019t want to do those things, and I don\u2019t want to be the person who has done them. But I guess there\u2019s a limit to how much we can subvert or sublimate our essential nature. Billy Joel is the poster child for this disappointing epiphany: he\u2019s never not Billy Joel to the hilt. At times, I envy him his big, irritating, sloppy personality, his unabashed embrace of his own worst qualities. And honestly, would you want him to be any different?</p><p class=\"\">I wouldn\u2019t have wanted my grandfather to be any different, either, although he and I share a few flaws: hedonistic urges, fiscal profligacy, marital disharmony. He wasn\u2019t actually my grandfather, by the way. My biological grandfather was a physical and psychological abuser whom my grandmother wisely divorced in her early thirties \u2014 not an easy thing for a woman to do at that time, or at any time, I guess. But Pop Pop is the grandfather who was actually there for me, and I will admit inheritance of his foibles without shame, even as, every day, I endeavor to tamp down the impatience and anger that is my genetic heritage. I need to believe that a good person can sometimes do stupid things or produce shitty work. I have, after all, to protect my show.</p><p class=\"\">And yes, I proudly claim Billy Joel as an influence, too. Maybe the most important one, who knows. He\u2019s with me every time I try to amuse my children\u2019s friends with a dumb joke, every time I lose my cool, every time I recycle my own ideas or somebody else\u2019s, or otherwise make an ass of myself, and I guess even when I manage to do something pretty good. My first act, upon moving into the divorced-dad condo that is now my home, was to buy a used LP of <em>Glass Houses</em> and give it a spin. Billy Joel is the clown prince of my middle age. He is driving, for better or worse, the brown borrowed van to Baltimore that is my adult life, and riding the brakes all the way.<br /><br /><br /></p><p class=\"\">NOTES</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[1]</a> How on earth did this extraordinary cultural artifact, a WNYC-produced podcast interview between Joel his fellow Long Islander, escape my attention for the first three years of its existence? The two men engage in almost unbearably chummy mugging and riffing, telling jokes, doing funny voices, and belting out \u201cIn A Gadda-Da-Vida,\u201d and Baldwin can\u2019t resist subtly undermining the great troubaour, needling him about his height and, at one point, correcting his word choice and usage. Anyway, Joel disabuses listeners of the idea the \u201cPiano Man\u201d was, in fact, a hot unit: \u201cPeople perceive that to be a hit. It was not a hit [...] It was a <em>turntable hit.</em> It didn\u2019t sell through.\u201d</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[2]</a> It now seems inevitable that President Donald Trump should take office in the song\u2019s titular year. Damn you, Billy Joel.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[3]</a> At a concert at Hobart and William Smith college in 1996, a fan asked Joel if the song was inspired by a real person. The character, Joel replied, is a composite. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda preachy, judgemental,\u201d he admits, then adds, channeling <em>This Is Spinal Tap,</em> that the music is written \u201cin the style of Bach.\u201d </p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[4]</a> Maps, Billy? The kind you need while crossing America on...a rock and roll tour? And these medals: do they gleam? Are they twelve inches round? Level with us, Billy...are they <em>gold records?</em></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[5]</a> A few years ago, my then-adolescent daughter tried to start her first rock band. The guitarist, an eleven-year-old, came over, lifted a gleaming Les Paul out of its case, and tore into a quite convincing rendition of \u201cHot for Teacher.\u201d The band didn\u2019t work out. Oh, my child, fruit of my loins, I am so sorry.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[6]</a> While writing this, I became convinced I was making it up. Could there have been a market, in 1986, for such a thing? I looked on the internet, though, and there it was: a simple white booklet bearing the band\u2019s name in drop-shadowed red sans-serif, a rakishly angled live shot of Lewis singing in an era-appropriate blousy geometric print shirt, and the iconic logo of the film <em>Back to the Future,</em> which featured the song.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[7]</a> My grandparents also inadvertently introduced me to MTV, which had become available on their side of the river in Pennsylvania years before it arrived on mine in New Jersey. I\u2019m sure my grandfather longed for me to associate his home primarily with Pablo Picasso and the Modern Jazz Quartet, but <em>Omni</em> and MTV are the things that stuck.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[8]</a> \u201cYou're so ambitious for a juvenile,\u201d the singer observes, as though his interlocutor were an underaged criminal offender or a rare species of eagle. Give Joel the choice between a rhyme and a coherent English sentence and he\u2019ll pick the rhyme every time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[9]</a> Although, Stones snark aside, I think Joel is pretty coked up at this juncture, too. There\u2019s another video, \u201cAll for Leyna,\u201d that appears to be drawn from this same filming session, but the studio recording is dubbed over it \u2014 Joel is just acting too ridiculous in it to have managed a competent performance of the song. It opens with him slowly rising, like a bug-eyed prairie dog, from underneath his enormous electric piano and synthesizer, and is punctuated throughout by wacky hand motions and Cosbyesque fourth-wall penetration. These antics ought to be anathema to the song\u2019s histrionics, yet it all feels of a piece somehow.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[10]</a> <em>The Nylon Curtain</em> is merely the worst offender in a recording career refulgent with pointed foley work: in this case, industrial clanking and heavy workingman\u2019s breathing on \u201cAllentown,\u201d crickets and thudding synthesized helicopter rotors on \u201cGoodnight, Saigon\u201d (making it sound more like a hospital parking lot in New Jersey, frankly, than a war zone in southeast Asia), and Swedish travel announcements in \u201cScandinavian Skies,\u201d because, I guess, the title alone isn\u2019t adequately persuasive? None of this, however, can top, for sheer redundancy, the shattering glass sound at the beginning of <em>Glass Houses,</em> cleverly placed to clarify the message conveyed by both the front and back cover images, and by the title, so that it is impossible to miss the ludicrous clich\u00e9 that is the album\u2019s guiding metaphor.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[11]</a> My friend and bandmate Adam O\u2019Fallon Price, via email: \u201cSpringsteen so successfully and adroitly molded his persona, and with BJ it always sounds so forced and difficult. There's such a weight of insecurity with him, this palpable fear of being exposed as this little Bridge and Tunnel chump. [...] I guess I prefer Springsteen's music, but I definitely prefer BJ as a literary character. He's like the Hamlet of successful rock musicians.\u201d</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[12]</a> At the keyboard, no one can tell how tall you are.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[13]</a> This is starting to feel like nitpicking now, but it\u2019s worth pointing out that Joel actually <em>sings</em> the count-in. It\u2019s hard to explain to non-musicians how cringeworthy this is. Even including a spoken count-in on a studio recording is in questionable taste (full disclosure: yes, of course I\u2019ve done it), but to assign notes to the count-in, and full-throatedly sing them, is a uniquely Joelian bit of rock-insider foregrounding.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[14]</a> In an ominous prefiguring of Joel\u2019s impending onstage freakout in Moscow, he actually, near the video\u2019s end, knocks the mic stand to the floor. Of course it\u2019s magically standing again a few seconds later, when Joel turns away from it to attempt his own, highly awkward, direct communion with the camera.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[15]</a> As, I suppose, everyone does.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"\" title=\"\">[16]</a> \u201cMe as Tchaikovsky!\u201d he says to Baldwin in the WYNC interview, banging out the opening synth line to \u201cPressure\u201d on the piano.

        "full_content": "As was foretold, today we read \"Ogre,\" Clifford Simak's contribution to the January 1944 issue of Astounding .\u00a0 (We've already read\u00a0the A. E. van Vogt , Frank Belknap Long , Hal Clement and P. Schuyler Miller fiction in this issue of John W. Campbell's genre-defining magazine.)\u00a0 We'll also take a look at two other Astounding pieces by Simak, \"Lobby,\" another 1944 story,\u00a0and 1949's \"Eternity Lost.\"\u00a0 I'm reading all of these stories in scans of the issues of Astounding in which they debuted. \"Ogre\" (1944) Here we have a story full of great science fiction ideas, ideas that exploit and reflect our fears of loneliness as well as of loss of individuality, our fascination with art and our vulnerability to dangerous addictions, our dreams of perfect health and concerns over who and what determines our true identities--does our blood or the place we were born determine who we are, or can we adopt piecemeal or in toto the culture of people of other races and civilizations?\u00a0 \"Ogre\" also reminds us of all those Somerset Maugham stories about Westerners out in the colonies, trying to make a buck, dealing with the inscrutable natives and running the risk of--or embracing the thrill of--going native.\u00a0 Well-written and fun at the same time it tackles these issues of identity and imperialism, with \"Ogre\" we are starting off this blog post with a hit--thumbs up! \"Ogre\" has many characters but almost all of them have personalities and strong motivations so they aren't hard to tell apart and most of them provide drama or entertainment and/or offer illustrations of the story's themes.\u00a0 \"Ogre\" is set on a planet where plants developed intelligence and animal-like mobility.\u00a0 Native to this world are plants like sheets or cloaks that can crawl around and can tap into the brain activity of any other living thing they touch.\u00a0 When humans arrived on the planet these things, called \"blankets\" throughout the story, were thrilled to develop a symbiotic relationship with Earthers, because these blankets have naturally dim wits and dull lives, but connected to a man they suddenly had deep feelings and the ability for complex thought.\u00a0 Humans embraced these relationships because the blankets have super-efficient physiologies and can absorb energy directly from the environment, heal quickly and fend of disease with ease, and when touching a human they can share these abilities with him--a man with a blanket need not eat, and can quickly recover from any kind of injury or infection, beyond having a constant companion who shares his attitudes and goals. The blankets are kind of like non-white individuals during the ages of exploration and imperialism who take on the culture of white colonists, subalterns who embrace service to their technological superiors.\u00a0 Simak in \"Ogre\" also dramatizes the opposite sort of relationship, the colonist who goes native.\u00a0 Among the many other types of sentient plants on this vegetable-dominated planet are trees that produce music of staggering beauty.\u00a0 Much money can be made by human merchants who can record this music and sell it to Earthers living around the galaxy.\u00a0 But there is a risk to this music--it is so beautiful that humans can become addicted to it and neglect their health and abandon all social norms as they become obsessed with it.\u00a0 A major component of the plot of the story is the behavior of a man who becomes obsessed in this way, and another plot strand involves one of the intelligent ambulatory plants--probably the most intelligent of them--who hatches a scheme to use the trees to become master of the human race. With all these plants who want to become like men and men who fall under the sway of plants we have , multiple examples of entities of one culture or species who desire to, or risk being forced to, take on elements of the identities of another culture or race.\u00a0 And there's more!\u00a0 We also have an iteration of a characteristic Simak character--the sympathetic robot who is probably \"better\" than humans but who yearns to be considered human.\u00a0 This robot is at the Earth trading post at the behest of the interstellar business enterprise that owns the post, charged with the mission of making sure the humans working for the corporation do not steal or otherwise misuse and waste the corporation's resources and ensuring compliance with the many company rules and government regulations that govern the company and its employees.\u00a0 This robot plays the role of a comic relief character--it even has bad grammar--but is also the hero of the story, being more honest, more brave, better at fighting, etc., than the rest of the cast.\u00a0 This character brings a lot to the story, but I will warn my 21st-century readers that this character may be modelled on and intended to remind readers of stereotypes of nagging women and African-American subalterns, and the robot does use the dreaded \"N-word,\" the word people of my ancestry use nowadays only at great risk, in the cliche \"n----- in the woodpile.\" Looking beyond the numerous humans and the various types of plants, plus the robot, this planet is also the site of a rival trading post to that of the Earthers, an outpost of evil insectoids from another space faring civilization.\u00a0 This story offers multiple examples of what some of the characters consider treason to the race, and one of them is provided by a human who joins the insect people in an operation against the interests of the Earth station. As for the plot of \"Ogre,\" I won't get too far into it except to say it is full of incident--dangerous journeys, gun fights, hand-to-hand combat, monster attacks, double crosses, schemes that offer tremendous wealth and threaten entire civilizations.\u00a0 Simak handles all this material ably--the fighting and scheming is entertaining and exciting and the comic relief and serious themes of the story work in concert with the action-adventure material instead of undermining or sidelining it. I can't think of anything bad to say about \"Ogre.\"\u00a0 A very fine piece of work.\u00a0 Highly recommended to anybody with any interest in popular fiction. After its debut in this terrific issue of Astounding , \"Ogre\" reappeared in Donald Wollheim's Adventures on Other Planets , multiple European anthologies, multiple \"Best of Astounding / Analog \" volumes, and several Simak collections. \"Lobby\" (1944) \"Ogre\" was about universal, timeless, concerns, like imperialism and identity, that are inherently interesting.\u00a0 \"Lobby\" is about particular, timely, concerns, like atomic power, that are sort of interesting, and things that I guess are sort of universal and timeless, like industrial espionage and government corruption, but are sort of boring.\u00a0 \"Lobby\"'s characters are a bore, mere cardboard cutouts.\u00a0 Its plot is resolved by a deus ex machina device--lame!\u00a0 Plus, it is one of those stories that craps on the traditions of Anglo-American liberalism, like jury trials and elected government and private enterprise, in favor of technocratic world government--gross!\u00a0 A big step down from \"Ogre.\" It is the post-World War II world.\u00a0 World government is trying to take control, but its hands are full in the ruins of Europe and Asia so the United States still has its independence.\u00a0 Cobb is a businessman based in New York and Butler is the world's greatest scientist, out in Montana.\u00a0 Butler is on the brink of bringing the world's first atomic power plant on line; Cobb is his partner, handling the business and political end.\u00a0 Atomic power has the potential to revolutionize the world economy--the arrival of cheap and abundant energy will end poverty.\u00a0 But the people who own and manage and work for and have invested in the fossil fuel and hydroelectric power industries (in this story they are lumped together as \"the power lobby\") will lose their livelihoods, or so they think, and so they oppose the development of atomic reactors, telling the world atomic power is dangerous, setting up a bogus religious sect to preach against messing with the atom, buying off senators, etc. The atomic reactor in Montana is almost ready to go online and prove that atomic power is safe and efficient, so the power lobby sabotages it; the resulting catastrophic explosion kills 100 people.\u00a0 Luckily, Butler and all his files survive.\u00a0 But isn't this the kind of PR blow that will end all public support for atomic power? Here comes the deus ex machina!\u00a0 A genius lawyer from the world government (somehow) has all the evidence necessary to prove that the power lobby blew up the reactor.\u00a0 The power lobby says that his evidence won't be enough to convince a jury, but the man from the world government says ha ha, there will be no jury--at the world court in Switzerland expert judges decide cases, not juries of gullible and emotional proles!\u00a0 The world government lawyer proceeds to blackmail the power lobby--in return for not being put on trial, the lobby's ringleaders agree to work in concert with Butler and Cobb under the direction of the world government to bring atomic power to the masses without too much economic dislocation.\u00a0 The legal eagle gloats that, once the world government has control of atomic power, individual governments like that in the U.S. will lose all power and there will be no more elections decided by easily swayed commoners and no more private business run by greedy money grubber, just scientists running the world scientifically. Disgusting!\u00a0 Thumbs down! (For the record, I think nuclear power is great, but I wouldn't abandon elected government, private property, and trial by jury to get it.) The issue of Astounding that includes \"Lobby\" also features A. E. van Vogt's \"The Changeling,\" various forms of which I have read and blogged about, and Fritz Leiber's \"Sanity,\" the version of which known as \"Crazy Wolf\" I have read and blogged about.\u00a0 \"Lobby\" resurfaced to preach its gospel of atomic power and rule by unelected eggheads in Groff Conklin's The Best of Science Fiction in 1946.\u00a0 In 2023 it reappeared in the Simak collection Buckets of Diamonds and Other Stories , the thirteenth volume of The Complete Short Fiction of Clifford D. Simak . I guess The Complete Short Fiction of Clifford D. Simak isn't presenting Simak's work in chronological order. \"Eternity Lost\" (1949) The July 1949 issue of Astounding in which we find \"Eternity Lost\" includes James H. Schmitz's \"Agent of Vega,\" a book version of which we read in 2016, when we were young.\u00a0 The cover story is nonfiction, about a nuclear reactor. \"Eternity Lost\" shares a lot with \"Lobby;\" we've got a world government and a new form of technology being suppressed by a conspiracy.\u00a0 But, thankfully, this story also has a decent plot, an effort to create a human character, and a surprise twist ending.\u00a0 We'll call it mildly recommendable. After the world government based in Geneva took over, longevity treatments were developed--when a person gets old, like around 90 or so, such a treatment can rejuvenate him, give him another approximately 100 years.\u00a0 The government decided that it wouldn't fair if people could buy this boon, and giving it to everybody wouldn't be practicable, so it was decided that only a tiny number of people should be able to get rejuvenated, people chosen by the government, ostensibly because they are providing a service to humanity.\u00a0 Simak includes dialogue from the government hearings that led to this decision, including testimony from various people attacking the rejuvenation program, as flashbacks throughout the story. The main story takes place like 500 years after those hearings.\u00a0 The man who chaired those hearings, Senator Leonard, is almost 600 years old and has had five of the rare treatments.\u00a0 But as the story begins he learns that he won't be getting another!\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 It looks like he will lose the next election, and his party isn't going to pull the strings necessary for him to get a sixth treatment.\u00a0 Already old and starting to forget things, Leonard only has a few years to live! Simak does a decent job describing Leonard's emotions and philosophical reflections upon facing death as well as speculating about how individuals and society might respond to the fact that a tiny elite minority gets to live indefinitely.\u00a0 Simak also presents a pretty good plot as Leonard scrambles to figure out a way to get a rejuvenation treatment illegally.\u00a0 Leonard learns that advancements have been made in longevity science--actual immortality has been achieved!\u00a0 But kept secret from the public and even top legislators like himself because the news might cause economic and political upheaval.\u00a0 Leonard also learns that the cabal that controls the immortality technique will release the technique to the public when a viable extrasolar space program has been developed and discovered alien planets suitable for colonization. Leonard fails to figure out how to get a treatment through unconventional channels.\u00a0 So he decides to go out with a bang, to do the George Costanza \" I am breaking up with you !\" thing.\u00a0 Before the public finds out that he has been denied a rejuvenation treatment, he announces to the world that he is refusing his next treatment to show solidarity with the common people.\u00a0 He figures this will blacken the reputation of all the other people who have been getting the treatments, the people who turned their backs on him--revenge! Leonard becomes wildly popular!\u00a0 But then comes the twist ending!\u00a0 The cabal that controls the immortality technique has secretly developed space craft that can reach hospitable alien planets and is secretly organizing recon expeditions to them.\u00a0 They sent Leonard a letter inviting him to get immortality and join just such an expedition a week ago, but because he is getting forgetful on his senescence, he forgot to look at his mail.\u00a0 Now that he has turned against the elite of which he is a part they, of course, are rescinding the offer, and Leonard will soon die, knowing he was so so close to living forever and spending that life as a vigorous and respected man, exploring the universe. There are plot holes in this story, and elements that don't make a lot of sense, and of course it advocates elite manipulation of the public, but still it isn't actually bad, the main character, pacing, and twist ending offering entertainment. \"Eternity Lost\" would reappear in Everett F. Blieler and T. E. Dikty's The Best Science Fiction Stories: 1950 and in Campbell's big (like 600 pages!) The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology and its little\u00a0 abridged paperback version (fewer than 200 pages.)\u00a0 Martin H. Greenberg included it in three different anthologies, and the story would be reproduced in the tenth volume of The Collected Short Fiction of Clifford D. Simak, The Shipshape Miracle and other stories. ********** It's a roller coaster ride!\u00a0 We've got \"Ogre,\" a five-neurotic-robots-out-of-five story, \"Lobby,\" a story that sucks and even made me angry, and then \"Eternity Lost,\" a decent twist ending story.\u00a0 \"Ogre\" and \"Eternity Lost\" have merit as entertainment and have good science fiction ideas and of course I am recommending them.\u00a0 But let's play devil's advocate--I can even make a case for reading the execrable \"Lobby\" to those of you who are students of popular literature. Science fiction is the literature of ideas, the literature that speculates on technology and its effect on society, the literature of the paradigm shift, the literature that considers alternate ways of organizing society and living your life.\u00a0 Well, that is what \"Lobby\" is all about... all about, it totally lacking any kind of literary or entertainment value.\u00a0 \"Lobby\" represents a type of science fiction, the story that offers ideas and advocates for their adoption to the exclusion of all else, and it represents a large segment of the science fiction community that sees science and technology as the key to a better future, and prioritizes science and technology over traditional American values like democracy and the market economy, that in the period of the Depression, the Second World War, and the early Cold War, advocated for atomic power, technocracy, and world government as solutions to the crises facing the world in the 1930-1960 era.\u00a0 So I guess I am sort of telling you to read \"Lobby,\" even though I am suggesting you likely won't enjoy it.

Schmitz's <a href=\"https://mporcius.blogspot.com/2016/12/agent-of-vega-by-james-h-schmitz.html\">\"Agent of Vega,\"</a> a book version of which we read in 2016, when we were young.&nbsp; The cover story is nonfiction, about a nuclear reactor.</div><div><br /></div><div>\"Eternity Lost\" shares a lot with \"Lobby;\" we've got a world government and a new form of technology being suppressed by a conspiracy.&nbsp; But, thankfully, this story also has a decent plot, an effort to create a human character, and a surprise twist ending.&nbsp; We'll call it mildly recommendable.</div><div><br /></div><div>After the world government based in Geneva took over, longevity treatments were developed--when a person gets old, like around 90 or so, such a treatment can rejuvenate him, give him another approximately 100 years.&nbsp; The government decided that it wouldn't fair if people could buy this boon, and giving it to everybody wouldn't be practicable, so it was decided that only a tiny number of people should be able to get rejuvenated, people chosen by the government, ostensibly because they are providing a service to humanity.&nbsp; Simak includes dialogue from the government hearings that led to this decision, including testimony from various people attacking the rejuvenation program, as flashbacks throughout the story.</div><div><br /></div><div>The main story takes place like 500 years after those hearings.&nbsp; The man who chaired those hearings, Senator Leonard, is almost 600 years old and has had five of the rare treatments.&nbsp; But as the story begins he learns that he won't be getting another!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; It looks like he will lose the next election, and his party isn't going to pull the strings necessary for him to get a sixth treatment.&nbsp; Already old and starting to forget things, Leonard only has a few years to live!</div><div><br /></div><div>Simak does a decent job describing Leonard's emotions and philosophical reflections upon facing death as well as speculating about how individuals and society might respond to the fact that a tiny elite minority gets to live indefinitely.&nbsp; Simak also presents a pretty good plot as Leonard scrambles to figure out a way to get a rejuvenation treatment illegally.&nbsp; Leonard learns that advancements have been made in longevity science--actual immortality has been achieved!&nbsp; But kept secret from the public and even top legislators like himself because the news might cause economic and political upheaval.&nbsp; Leonard also learns that the cabal that controls the immortality technique will release the technique to the public when a viable extrasolar space program has been developed and discovered alien planets suitable for colonization.</div><div><br /></div><div>Leonard fails to figure out how to get a treatment through unconventional channels.&nbsp; So he decides to go out with a bang, to do the George Costanza \"<i>I</i> am breaking up with <i>you</i>!\" thing.&nbsp; Before the public finds out that he has been denied a rejuvenation treatment, he announces to the world that he is refusing his next treatment to show solidarity with the common people.&nbsp; He figures this will blacken the reputation of all the other people who have been getting the treatments, the people who turned their backs on him--revenge!</div><div><br /></div><div>Leonard becomes wildly popular!&nbsp; But then comes the twist ending!&nbsp; The cabal that controls the immortality technique has secretly developed space craft that can reach hospitable alien planets and is secretly organizing recon expeditions to them.&nbsp; They sent Leonard a letter inviting him to get immortality and join just such an expedition a week ago, but because he is getting forgetful on his senescence, he forgot to look at his mail.&nbsp; Now that he has turned against the elite of which he is a part they, of course, are rescinding the offer, and Leonard will soon die, knowing he was so so close to living forever and spending that life as a vigorous and respected man, exploring the universe.</div><div><br /></div><div>There are plot holes in this story, and elements that don't make a lot of sense, and of course it advocates elite manipulation of the public, but still it isn't actually bad, the main character, pacing, and twist ending offering entertainment.</div><div><br /></div><div>\"Eternity Lost\" would reappear in Everett F. Blieler and T. E. Dikty's <i>The Best Science Fiction Stories: 1950&nbsp;</i>and in Campbell's big (like 600 pages!)&nbsp;<i>The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology</i>&nbsp;and its little&nbsp; abridged paperback version (fewer than 200 pages.)&nbsp; Martin H.

He probably will. I teach 7th grade and my oldest (Olivia) teaches kindergarten. We both have repeat names. Between the 3 classes I teach (so a little under 60 kids) I have 5 Olivia\u2019s, 4 Sophia\u2019s, 2 Mias, 2 Emma\u2019s, and 3 Liams, and 3 Noah\u2019s, and 2 Aidens. In my daughter\u2019s kindergarten class she has a Sofia, a Sophia, an Oliver, and an Olivia. She said the class next door has 2 boys named Luca. There are also a bunch of Emmas and Mias. If you name your kid a popular name, I wouldn\u2019t count on the rule of names being less popular now than they were before. This clash of data vs. personal experience doesn\u2019t mean either is wrong. It all comes down to patterns: in the way names are chosen, and our own perceptions of the world. Factor 1: The Siren Song of Sounds The Reddit poster, like many of us, viewed the names Oliver and Olivia as evidence of conformity. The two \u201cOliv\u201d powerhouses have risen in tandem, and our minds naturally want to merge their shared popularity. The trick is, we don\u2019t give names of the past the same courtesy. For instance, if we group Oliver with Olivia then we have to go back and group John with Joan , Jane and Jean , female versions of the name separated by a single vowel sound. When you compare the peaks of each group, you get a sense of how our notion of \u201cpopular\u201d has changed. Encountering similar-sounding names creates a sense of repetition. Oliver and Olivia; Mia and Maya . Sound is a particularly dominant force today, as tradition has taken a back seat. Yet sound trends have existed across the generations, from Millie and Minnie to Lakisha and Latasha . That\u2019s the nature of style, and Mia and Maya aren\u2019t the same name any more than Gary and Larry are. Factor 2: Birds of a Feather Tastes reflect our cultural vantage points. The same name may come across differently to people depending on wealth and education, race and ethnicity, age and sex, religion and national origin, region and urbanicity. Once America\u2019s name culture opened up to accept more creativity, name styles branched out based on all of these dimensions. But it\u2019s no secret that our diverse society clusters into not-so-diverse communities. We tend to have a lot in common with our friends and neighbors. So as national name trends splintered, they left behind microclimates of style. Within a single community, or a single school, one or two fashion trends may reign supreme. If we keep hearing the same baby names over and over, that may say more about how and where we live than about the names we choose. Factor 3: Ooh, a Pattern! As human beings, we notice patterns. We notice repetitions. We don\u2019t often notice their absence. We all encounter the same names from time to time, thanks to a combination of shared community tastes and just plain coincidence. More popular names naturally recur more often. But the fact that we notice repetition doesn\u2019t necessarily point to a lack of diversity. In fact, we may notice shared names more today because they\u2019ve become more noteworthy. Once upon a time in England, a quarter of all babies were named John and Mary. Even in 19 th -century America, the number was 10%. In those settings nobody expected first names to be unique, so repeats were hardly worth mentioning. You\u2019d simply choose a secondary identifier for each individual, like a nickname or family association. Today repetitions are conspicuous and stick in our minds. That feeds into the \u201cavailability bias,\u201d the tendency to rely on the information that comes quickly to mind when judging likelihoods, and thus overestimate the frequency of memorable events. Consider these comments in reply to the original Reddit post about the concentration of common names: \u201cAgreed. My son\u2019s toddler music class of 17 kids had 3 Sophias + a Sophie and 2 Charlottes !\u201d \u201cThere are a few names you find in abundance, like Isabelle and Charlie \u201d \u201cMy daughter has a Christian and a Kristian in her absolutely tiny classroom\u201d \u201cMy kid\u2019s class of about 40 has two Elenors , two Ivys and two Parkers \u201d \u201cI recently attended a child\u2019s birthday party with maybe a dozen kids, and there were two kids named Luca .\u201d All of those parents noticed conformity, but taken together their experiences show the opposite. In short, a young Luca today may know a bunch of other Lucas. But a young John of the past was guaranteed to know a bunch of other Johns.

Monster mods The Creation were the latter, slamming out one killer seven inch after another from 1966 through 1968. Their one LP, We Are Paintermen , was basically a singles comp, and not an especially well programmed one. Filling out the platter with middling covers of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" and \"Hey Joe\" that made no one forget Dylan or Hendrix didn't help either. So a box with the singles and nothing but the singles is the ideal presentation for The Creation's big chord bombs, pounding drums, and cascades of bowed guitar, all red with purple flashes. Demon Records first released one in 2014, the imaginatively titled The Singles Boxset . That set contained 11 seven inches, two of which contained three tracks each. It not only made room for all of the singles The Creation originally released in the sixties but pretty much every other complete recording they made too. That includes the US version of \"How Does It Feel to Feel\", the outtake \"Sweet Helen\", and those two covers from We Are Paintermen . These four tracks didn't make the cut of Demon's latest Creation singles box, Biff Bang Pow: The Singles. The covers aren't really missed, but the two Creation originals are tougher omissions, since the feedback-streaked US version of \"How Does It Feel to Feel\" slays the UK one and \"Sweet Helen\" is a pretty good song too. Biff Bang Pow also differs in that instead of housing each single in its own sleeve, it contains five heavy-weight gatefold sleeves with paper inners. The Singles Boxset utilized a lot of the graphics from The Creations' original sixties picture sleeves, mostly not bothering to match them with the right records. Biff Bang Pow uses all new graphics but the inner gatefolds are adorned with black and white images of the original picture sleeves, as well as band photos, ads, and other memorabilia. The black vinyl or the 2014 set has been replaced with thick vinyl in a cavalcade of colors, and yes, that includes red and purple. For sound comparison purposes I only had Edsel Records' 1982 comp How Does It Feel , a great platter of songs, though one that crammed eight onto each side. So Biff Bang Pow easily clears the hurdle of besting the Edsel LP's audio. These mono singles are louder and more dynamic, more open, alive, and crunchy, with thumping bass and clear highs. That's just what you want when spinning rock and roll as thumping as \"Making Time\", \"Nightmares\", or \"I Am the Walker\". This is the best I've ever heard them sound.",

Yet, a popular adage highlights the presence of opportunity: Buy when blood is running in the streets. This guideline makes sense if property rights are maintained and the market recovers. This statement has been credited to a member of the Rothschild family of bankers. A more elaborate version states: You must buy when blood is running on the streets \u2014 even when it\u2019s your own. Would you please explore this topic? Reply from Quote Investigator: The earliest match found by QI appeared in \u201cThe Globe\u201d newspaper of Toronto, Canada on December 29, 1893. The following passage referred to \u201crentes\u201d which were bonds issued by the government of France. Boldface added to excerpts by QI : 1 A French investor at a critical time was advised by one of the Rothschilds to buy rentes. \u201cWhat!\u201d he cried. \u201cBuy Government securities while the streets of the capital are running with blood?\u201d \u201cMy friend,\u201d was the reply, \u201cif the streets were not running with blood you couldn\u2019t buy rentes at present prices.\u201d The passage did not precisely identify the member of the Rothschild family who offered the advice. Also, the historical event that precipitated the violence was not specified. This early anecdote did not directly present a compact proverb. The statement above which was similar to the modern proverb, was formulated as a question not an adage. Nevertheless, over time this anecdote evolved to yield the proverb. Below are additional selected citations in chronological order. The gruesome depiction of the streets of Paris running with blood has a long history. For example, in 1792 an article in an Irish newspaper about the French Revolution said the following: 2 It was they who planned and directed the execution of those dreadful scenes which made the streets of Paris run with blood during the first week of September, and which still excite horror in the most distant departments. The proverb under examination is often linked to a more recent event. The Paris Commune was a revolutionary government that seized power in Paris in March 1871. It was suppressed by May 1871. On January 1, 1894 \u201cThe Chicago Daily Tribune\u201d printed a piece containing the anecdote about buying securities in a distressed market. The market was agitated because of the Paris Commune: 3 It is related that in the old days of the Commune in Paris a panic-stricken investor turned up in the office of M. de Rothschild and exclaimed: \u201cYou advise me to buy securities now. You are my enemy. The streets of Paris run with blood.\u201d And Rothschild\u2019s answer was this: \u201cMy dear friend, if the streets of Paris were not running with blood do you think you would be able to buy at the present prices?\u201d The moral of that is applicable now. Everybody is downcast, everybody hopeless, everybody fearful that the bottom is about to drop out of everything. People who buy now are brave. Unless all precedents fail their bravery will bring profit. On the same day, \u201cThe Kansas City Star\u201d of Missouri published the same anecdote although the phrasing was slightly different: 4 A French investor at a critical time was advised by one of the Rothschilds to buy rentes. \u201cWhat!\u201d he cried. \u201cBuy government securities while the streets of the capital are running with blood?\u201d \u201cMy friend,\u201d was the reply, \u201cif the streets were not running with blood you couldn\u2019t buy rentes at present prices.\u201d On January 21, 1894, the following version of the anecdote appeared in \u201cThe New York Times\u201d: 5 \u2026 they tell in Wall Street the story of old Baron Rothschild, who, in the time of the Paris Commune, having advised a friend to buy French rentes, was criticised by a customer, who declared that it was foolish to think of making such investments while the streets of Paris were running with blood, to which the famous financier responded: \u201cBut, my friend, you could never buy at anything like these prices if the streets were not filled with blood.\u201d In 1910 \u201cMunsey\u2019s Magazine\u201d of New York printed a version of the tale in which the sewers of Paris were running red with blood. A friend asked Baron Rothschild what he was doing in response to Paris Commune: 6 \u201cWhy,\u201d replied the famous banker musingly, \u201crentes are selling at sixty-five. I bought five millions yesterday.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d exclaimed the other. \u201cBought rentes? Why, France is without a government, and the sewers of Paris are running red with blood!\u201d \u201cYes, it is deplorable,\u201d remarked the baron, \u201cbut if the sewers of Paris were not running red with blood, I could not buy rentes at sixty-five. France will survive this terrible calamity, as she survived the Revolution, and the seven coalitions against her of all the powers of Europe. Her credit will again be the highest of any nation, and rentes will sell again above par.\u201d In 1916 the \u201cWeekly Market Letter\u201d of Thomas Gibson in New York City printed the anecdote and asserted that the advice giver was Anselm Rothschild who lived between 1803 and 1874: 7 It is a most simple and elemental truth that it is because of adverse conditions or prospects that we can buy stocks to advantage. The axiom dates back to Anselm Rothschild , who advised a friend to buy French rentes. \u201cBut the streets of Paris are running with blood,\u201d protested his astonished friend. \u201cThat,\u201d replied Rothschild, \u201cis why you can buy rentes at these prices.\u201d But simple as the proposition is it is impossible to convince any considerable number of people of its validity. The anecdote was transformed into a compact proverb in 1942 when journalist George T. Hughes of the North American Newspaper Alliance wrote the following: 8 Prices of the leading rubber company stocks have given a good demonstration of the Rothschild investment dictum to \u201cbuy when the streets run with blood.\u201d The rubber stocks had their blackest hour when the Japanese military machine rolled over Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies and other areas producing some 90 per cent of the world\u2019s crude rubber. Since then a few of them have doubled in quoted value \u2026 In 1964 another instance of the proverb appeared in the book \u201cBear Markets: How to Survive and Make Money in Them\u201d by Harry D. Schultz: 9 Someone recently said COURAGE is a vital need in the market. To be a successful investor you must have extraordinary courage. You must be fully invested when the majority are afraid to venture. You will be in cash when the unsophisticated are buying their heads off. Bear markets seem to require an extra measure. Rothschild once advised, \u201cBuy when the blood is running in the streets.\u201d He said it all. In September 1964 a columnist in \u201cThe Guardian\u201d newspaper of London printed an instance of the proverb: 10 The Rothschild dictum of \u201cbuy when the blood runs in the streets\u201d will be regarded as too extreme by most small investors; but buying opportunities should always be considered when a promising economic situation is superimposed on a sombre or doubtful political background. In June 1965 a newspaper in Salisbury, North Carolina attributed the proverb to an anonymous tycoon: 11 Another Wall Street tycoon said the time to buy \u201cis when blood is running in the streets.\u201d In 1973 the \u201cBoston Sunday Globe\u201d of Massachusetts published an article which attributed the saying to Lionel de Rothschild who lived between 1808 and 1879. The newspaper misspelled \u201cRothschild\u201d as \u201cRothchild\u201d: 12 Lord Lionel Rothchild, in his grisly but straightforward way, once said that \u201cthe time to buy is when the streets are running with blood.\u201d In 1980 a syndicated columnist attributed the saying to U.S. financier Bernard Baruch: 13 The financial wizard Bernard Baruch said, \u201cBuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets.\u201d That\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the real estate sales industry now. In 1987 James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg published \u201cBlood in the Streets: Investment Profits in a World Gone Mad\u201d which contained the following epigraph: 14 The best time to buy is when blood is running in the streets. \u2014 Nathan M. Rothschild Nathan Mayer Rothschild lived between 1777 and 1836. According to the book, Rothschild bought securities in the depressed London market in 1815 when many feared that Napoleon would defeat the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo. The market soared when traders learned about the triumph of the Duke of Wellington: 15 This story illustrates the Rothschild principle from which the title of this book is taken: \u201cThe best time to buy is when blood is running in the streets.\u201d It is a principle that is true today. The greatest profits can always be had by buying when prices are most depressed by pessimism. In 1990 quotation collector Robert Byrne attributed the saying to a famous U.S. businessman who died in 1937: 16 The way to make money is to buy when blood is running in the streets. John D. Rockefeller (1839-1937) In October 1994 the \u201cChicago Tribune\u201d printed an extended version of the adage. This was the first match for the extended version found by QI : 17 \u201cI love market crashes, panic. As one of the Rothschilds once said, you must buy when blood is running on the streets \u2014 even when it\u2019s your own.\u201d Mark Mobius, head of the emerging-markets team at Templeton Investment Management. In 2009 the extended version of the proverb appeared in a Carlsbad, New Mexico newspaper: 18 Some of the legendary investors would tell you that when pessimism is at its peak, is when optimism comes in. The quote most often quoted is by the Baron Rothschild, \u201cBuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own.\u201d In conclusion, this proverb was derived from an anecdote which appeared in 1893. This anecdote was retold in 1894 with additional details; the setting was the Paris Commune of 1871. This long delay reduced the credibility of the anecdote. In addition, early versions of the anecdote did not specify a precise member of the Rothschild family. The dialogue of the anecdote was converted into a proverb in 1942 by financial journalist George T. Hughes. The extended proverb which referred to \u201cyour own\u201d blood emerged in 1994. In 1916 the tale was implausibly linked to Anselm Rothschild. Later citations named Lionel de Rothschild and Nathan Mayer Rothschild. But QI believes that none of these citations is convincing. Overall, based on current evidence QI considers this anecdote to be apocryphal. Image Notes: Map of Paris published in 1657 by Dutch cartographer Jan Janssonius. The map was accessed via Wikipedia.

Boldface added to excerpts by <strong>QI</strong>:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#00930d07-b609-4b27-a439-c68bbb4c5a8d\" id=\"00930d07-b609-4b27-a439-c68bbb4c5a8d-link\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>A French investor at a critical time was advised by one of the Rothschilds to buy rentes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; he cried. <strong>&#8220;Buy Government securities while the streets of the capital are running with blood?&#8221;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#8220;My friend,&#8221;</strong> was the reply, <strong>&#8220;if the streets were not running with blood you couldn&#8217;t buy rentes at present prices.&#8221;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The passage did not precisely identify the member of the Rothschild family who offered the advice. Also, the historical event that precipitated the violence was not specified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This early anecdote did not directly present a compact proverb. The statement above which was similar to the modern proverb, was formulated as a question not an adage. Nevertheless, over time this anecdote evolved to yield the proverb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are additional selected citations in chronological order.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-453249\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>The gruesome depiction of the streets of Paris running with blood has a long history. For example, in 1792 an article in an Irish newspaper about the French Revolution said the following:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#e548fd79-f54b-4798-bce0-a6048a2c03eb\" id=\"e548fd79-f54b-4798-bce0-a6048a2c03eb-link\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It was they who planned and directed the execution of those <strong>dreadful scenes which made the streets of Paris run with blood</strong> during the first week of September, and which still excite horror in the most distant departments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The proverb under examination is often linked to a more recent event. The Paris Commune was a revolutionary government that seized power in Paris in March 1871. It was suppressed by May 1871.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 1, 1894 &#8220;The Chicago Daily Tribune&#8221; printed a piece containing the anecdote about buying securities in a distressed market. The market was agitated because of the Paris Commune:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#5598f1ee-96e6-4f6f-a036-e34d47ad5164\" id=\"5598f1ee-96e6-4f6f-a036-e34d47ad5164-link\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It is related that in the old days of the Commune in Paris a panic-stricken investor turned up in the office of M. de Rothschild and exclaimed:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#8220;You advise me to buy securities now. You are my enemy. The streets of Paris run with blood.&#8221;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Rothschild&#8217;s answer was this: <strong>&#8220;My dear friend, if the streets of Paris were not running with blood do you think you would be able to buy at the present prices?&#8221;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moral of that is applicable now. Everybody is downcast, everybody hopeless, everybody fearful that the bottom is about to drop out of everything. People who buy now are brave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless all precedents fail their bravery will bring profit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On the same day, &#8220;The Kansas City Star&#8221; of Missouri published the same anecdote although the phrasing was slightly different:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#37c4963b-c7d8-427c-b868-e0375a1a0062\" id=\"37c4963b-c7d8-427c-b868-e0375a1a0062-link\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>A French investor at a critical time was advised by one of the Rothschilds to buy rentes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#8220;What!&#8221;</strong> he cried. <strong>&#8220;Buy government securities while the streets of the capital are running with blood?&#8221;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#8220;My friend,&#8221;</strong> was the reply, <strong>&#8220;if the streets were not running with blood you couldn&#8217;t buy rentes at present prices.&#8221;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 21, 1894, the following version of the anecdote appeared in &#8220;The New York Times&#8221;:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#360ddf7b-ce69-4ea5-8bb4-de6f264137da\" id=\"360ddf7b-ce69-4ea5-8bb4-de6f264137da-link\">5</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u2026 they tell in Wall Street the story of old Baron Rothschild, who, in the time of the Paris Commune, having advised a friend to buy French rentes, was criticised by a customer, who declared that it was <strong>foolish to think of making such investments while the streets of Paris were running with blood,</strong> to which the famous financier responded: <strong>&#8220;But, my friend, you could never buy at anything like these prices if the streets were not filled with blood.&#8221;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1910 &#8220;Munsey&#8217;s Magazine&#8221; of New York printed a version of the tale in which the sewers of Paris were running red with blood. A friend asked Baron Rothschild what he was doing in response to Paris Commune:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#52325606-20fd-442a-9735-e83101bfeb33\" id=\"52325606-20fd-442a-9735-e83101bfeb33-link\">6</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; replied the famous banker musingly, &#8220;rentes are selling at sixty-five. I bought five millions yesterday.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed the other. &#8220;Bought rentes? <strong>Why, France is without a government, and the sewers of Paris are running red with blood!&#8221;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#8220;Yes, it is deplorable,&#8221;</strong> remarked the baron, <strong>&#8220;but if the sewers of Paris were not running red with blood, I could not buy rentes at sixty-five.</strong> France will survive this terrible calamity, as she survived the Revolution, and the seven coalitions against her of all the powers of Europe. Her credit will again be the highest of any nation, and rentes will sell again above par.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1916 the &#8220;Weekly Market Letter&#8221; of Thomas Gibson in New York City printed the anecdote and asserted that the advice giver was Anselm Rothschild who lived between 1803 and 1874:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#bffa99f7-68e1-4ad9-9021-97aaf81d2aae\" id=\"bffa99f7-68e1-4ad9-9021-97aaf81d2aae-link\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It is a most simple and elemental truth that it is because of adverse conditions or prospects that we can buy stocks to advantage. The axiom dates back to <strong>Anselm Rothschild</strong>, who advised a friend to buy French rentes. <strong>&#8220;But the streets of Paris are running with blood,&#8221;</strong> protested his astonished friend. <strong>&#8220;That,&#8221;</strong> replied Rothschild, <strong>&#8220;is why you can buy rentes at these prices.&#8221;</strong> But simple as the proposition is it is impossible to convince any considerable number of people of its validity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The anecdote was transformed into a compact proverb in 1942 when journalist George T. Hughes of the North American Newspaper Alliance wrote the following:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#65568697-8c3d-4c8c-8a07-7459e8ac6ba2\" id=\"65568697-8c3d-4c8c-8a07-7459e8ac6ba2-link\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Prices of the leading rubber company stocks have given a good demonstration of the Rothschild investment dictum to <strong>&#8220;buy when the streets run with blood.&#8221;</strong> The rubber stocks had their blackest hour when the Japanese military machine rolled over Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies and other areas producing some 90 per cent of the world&#8217;s crude rubber. Since then a few of them have doubled in quoted value &#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1964 another instance of the proverb appeared in the book &#8220;Bear Markets: How to Survive and Make Money in Them&#8221; by Harry D. Schultz:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#4df2f6c4-a753-47e8-9851-3bbdbedc8e73\" id=\"4df2f6c4-a753-47e8-9851-3bbdbedc8e73-link\">9</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Someone recently said COURAGE is a vital need in the market. To be a successful investor you must have extraordinary courage. You must be fully invested when the majority are afraid to venture.

Bear markets seem to require an extra measure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rothschild once advised, <strong>&#8220;Buy when the blood is running in the streets.&#8221;</strong> He said it all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 1964 a columnist in &#8220;The Guardian&#8221; newspaper of London printed an instance of the proverb:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#3c3c4a3d-17f6-4122-bd70-86f22f612200\" id=\"3c3c4a3d-17f6-4122-bd70-86f22f612200-link\">10</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The Rothschild dictum of <strong>&#8220;buy when the blood runs in the streets&#8221;</strong> will be regarded as too extreme by most small investors; but buying opportunities should always be considered when a promising economic situation is superimposed on a sombre or doubtful political background.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In June 1965 a newspaper in Salisbury, North Carolina attributed the proverb to an anonymous tycoon:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#7c756ffe-0ea6-4e88-89a9-ef80544e4928\" id=\"7c756ffe-0ea6-4e88-89a9-ef80544e4928-link\">11</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Another Wall Street tycoon said <strong>the time to buy &#8220;is when blood is running in the streets.&#8221;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1973 the &#8220;Boston Sunday Globe&#8221; of Massachusetts published an article which attributed the saying to Lionel de Rothschild who lived between 1808 and 1879.

According to the book, Rothschild bought securities in the depressed London market in 1815 when many feared that Napoleon would defeat the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo. The market soared when traders learned about the triumph of the Duke of Wellington:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#36205dab-2e3a-43c4-b312-a13d36870afb\" id=\"36205dab-2e3a-43c4-b312-a13d36870afb-link\">15</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>This story illustrates the Rothschild principle from which the title of this book is taken: <strong>&#8220;The best time to buy is when blood is running in the streets.&#8221; </strong>It is a principle that is true today.

Rockefeller (1839-1937)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 1994 the &#8220;Chicago Tribune&#8221; printed an extended version of the adage. This was the first match for the extended version found by <strong>QI</strong>:<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2025/11/17/blood-streets/#ce73a102-5819-41c4-832a-3a7a869e338f\" id=\"ce73a102-5819-41c4-832a-3a7a869e338f-link\">17</a></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;I love market crashes, panic.

This anecdote was retold in 1894 with additional details; the setting was the Paris Commune of 1871. This long delay reduced the credibility of the anecdote. In addition, early versions of the anecdote did not specify a precise member of the Rothschild family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dialogue of the anecdote was converted into a proverb in 1942 by financial journalist George T. Hughes. The extended proverb which referred to &#8220;your own&#8221; blood emerged in 1994.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1916 the tale was implausibly linked to Anselm Rothschild. Later citations named Lionel de Rothschild and Nathan Mayer Rothschild. But <strong>QI</strong> believes that none of these citations is convincing. Overall, based on current evidence <strong>QI</strong> considers this anecdote to be apocryphal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image Notes: Map of Paris published in 1657 by Dutch cartographer Jan Janssonius.

But so many issues I address with my writing students stem, I suspect, from subconsciously internalizing what works on the screen and trying to make it work on the page. Here are 12 things that film teaches us wrong (and 4 that it teaches us right) about writing fiction or narrative nonfiction. 1) The most important thing is eyes! Look at even the sappiest love stories of the 1900s, and eyes, eye color, and eye contact are barely mentioned. Jane Austen gives us the lovely dialogue \u201cI have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow,\u201d but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find someone gazing deeply into someone else\u2019s brown eyes. Yet do a Control+F on \u201ceyes\u201d in any mediocre modern novel and you\u2019ll get not only \u201cI stared into his soft green eyes\u201d but also a constant commentary on where someone is looking. (\u201cHe cast his eyes to the floor,\u201d \u201cHer eyes met Ralph\u2019s,\u201d \u201cHe glanced toward the audience,\u201d etc.) So\u2026 What changed around 120 years ago to make us so obsessed with eyes? Film happened. Specifically, two things: The closeup shot on an actor\u2019s eyes to telegraph emotion (self-explanatory), and the \u201cshot-reverse\u201d shot, which might need some explanation. This is the film editing technique wherein a two-person conversation is filmed over the shoulder from one side, then the other side. In order for us to believe  they\u2019re really talking to each other, and for a sense of spatial continuity, the director makes sure characters are matching the \u201ceyeline.\u201d This example (from Burn After Reading ) is from Studiobinder.com That\u2019s all fun stuff, but there\u2019s no reason we need to bring that fixation to the page. It might be familiar from the screen, but is it really true to life? Is eye color honestly the first thing you notice about someone? Are you constantly tracking where someone else is looking? Really? (If so, stop doing that. It\u2019s creepy.) 2) Scenes of people going about their daily lives with no real change are engaging and fun! On screen, this might look like women around New York getting dressed in the opening montage of The Devil Wears Prada , or it might look like someone stuck in normal bad traffic on a normal bad day in Office Space. But onscreen, you\u2019ve got music, camera cuts, closeups, colors, pretty faces\u2026 and the whole thing maybe takes one minute, tops. On the page, you\u2019ve got none of those things, and a three-page scene will take people six long minutes to read (longer if they zone out and have to reread) and no one comes out happy. Office Space, 1999 credit: 20th Century Fox 3) You\u2019re not allowed to tell us what\u2019s going on! In a movie, unless you have a voiceover narrator, this is true. You\u2019re going to have to get all the context across through dialogue, little clues, maybe someone conveniently turning on the TV news at the exact right moment so the newscaster can give an update on the relevant situation. You want to show a lot of time going by? You have to show the seasons changing or all the calendar pages flipping. You want us to know it\u2019s someone\u2019s last day of high school, and this character is his older brother? You need for the older brother to say \u201cHeyyy, little brother, congrats on your last day of high school!\u201d On the page, we have this amazing thing called exposition. The narrator can just tell people stuff . It\u2019s the coolest trick. If you ignore that, and you teach us information by having a character say \u201cHi there, neighbor! Haven\u2019t seen you since the funeral. How are you getting on without your wife, the big-shot lawyer? I hear the big 6-0 is coming up!\u201d we\u2019re going to kind of hate you. SubMakk is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. 4) You\u2019re not allowed to tell us what people are thinking! Quite similar to the above\u2026 On film, we need to know that a character is lying, but kind of sad about it, and so the camera zooms in realll close, and lingers on Jodi Foster\u2019s face doing its thing, and the music goes sad. That works really well! But you don\u2019t have camera zooms or music or Jodi Foster\u2019s face helping your story. So you need to tell us what someone\u2019s thinking. Hey, here\u2019s an entire series I wrote on interiority! I don\u2019t always blame this move on film consumption. Both journalists and lawyers, turning to fiction, have a hard time suddenly being allowed to put thoughts in someone\u2019s head. This would be irresponsible journalism, and in a courtroom you\u2019d get called out for speculation. I also blame both this one and the one above on people hearing \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d and assuming it means they\u2019re essentially supposed to write a screenplay. \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d is largely applicable to emotion. If a student writes He displayed rage or She acted embarrassed , I\u2019m likely to write Show this plz? in the margins. What it does not mean is that you\u2019re not allowed to give us exposition or interiority. Neglect those tools at your peril. 5) It\u2019s easy to acclimate people quickly to a complicated, unfamiliar setting! You want to set your movie in a futuristic New York where every building has a flying car port on top and there are highways through the air and half the people are genetically modified to be 7 feet tall and the sky is red and everyone\u2019s left hand is a phone and all the police are robots? Cool\u2014that will take you all of about ten seconds to get across onscreen. Lord of the Rings , 2001 credit: New Line Cinema You want to do all that stuff on the page? You\u2019ve got tougher options. Some writers think they\u2019re going to get away with devoting about ten seconds worth of space to establishing the context, or not mention it at all until it\u2019s way too late. Because it\u2019s never mentioned in the movies, it just is ! Other writers try to take the time necessary to let us see, in detail, everything we\u2019d see on the screen in ten seconds, and that turns out to be around thirty pages\u2014because on the page, everything needs to be explained. Readers will want to know exactly what those air highways look like and how they work and maybe even where they came from. So what are we supposed to do? It helps to weave those descriptions in on a need-to-know basis (e.g., the first time a cop shows up we learn about the robots), and it helps to simplify. What might have been colorful texture onscreen just takes too much of a reader\u2019s energy, and it turns out we don\u2019t really need those robocops after all to make the story work. Share 6) Or! Settings are neutral backdrops! One thing they love to do in Hollywood is save money when possible. You need two people to have a conversation, and a coffee shop set that\u2019s already built and on the lot is a lovely choice. It\u2019s got nothing to do with the story, and it\u2019s meant to be kind of invisible, and that\u2019s great. I pulled this still from Men in Black (1997, credit:  Columbia Pictures) from an entire IMDB \u201csitting on a park bench\u201d page. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever spoken to someone on a park bench in my life. But boy, would that be cheap to film. I do think that setting is one of our most underutilized tools on the page, and there\u2019s absolutely no reason to limit yourself to the budget or visual language of film. You have, right now, no matter who you are, an unlimited budget. And you might want to do something more interesting with setting, like picking one that puts pressure on characters, or one that presents opportunities for dynamic interaction. 7) It\u2019s always best to throw people into a story with no context whatsoever! Occasionally, a movie will start with a helpful voiceover or an effective establishing shot so we know what\u2019s up, but usually we\u2019re cast immediately in the role of the outside observer, just waiting and watching to see who everyone is and what their deal is. If you\u2019ve ever watched a movie with someone who says \u201cNow who is that?\u201d five minutes into the film when a new character appears, you\u2019ve probably found yourself saying things like \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to know yet,\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d And that\u2019s part of the fun of watching movies; we\u2019re both voyeur and detective, and since everything\u2019s right there in front of us visually, we aren\u2019t stuck not knowing what to picture. \u201cWhat, who is that guy? What\u2019s happening?\u201d asks your mom, two minutes into Inception (2010, Warner Bros.) On the page, though, a lack of context makes it very hard for readers to orient themselves . We don\u2019t know what to picture, so we picture nothing, or the wrong things. 8) Once you\u2019re in a scene, you\u2019re locked in, beat per beat! I once found an entire Reddit thread of people who grew up outside the US thinking that Americans end phone calls abruptly, without saying goodbye. They learned this from TV and movies, where you can\u2019t really leap forward in time, but it would also be absolutely deadly to replicate the end of a realistic phone call. (\u201cOkay, so I\u2019ll talk to you on Tues\u2014right, yeah, no, Wednesday.\u201d Long pause\u2026 \u201cTen your time, or ten my time?\u201d Long pause\u2026 \u201cOh, cause I\u2019m on Pacific time till Friday.\u201d Long pause\u2026 \u201cOkay, tell your mom I said hi!\u201d etc.) So what can a poor screenwriter do but have the character say \u201cIt\u2019s a plan!\u201d and just hang up the phone? Patrick Bateman is not going to hang up politely. ( American Psycho , 2000, Lionsgate) Fiction writers, not wanting their characters to be rude, are more likely to just give us the entire damn conversation, punctuated by He glanced out the window and \u2026 he said, tapping his cigarette. In other words, once the writer gets into a scene and starts to believe it\u2019s real, and starts to picture it beat by beat, they write down the whole thing, cigarette tapping and all. This doesn\u2019t just go for conversations\u2026 I\u2019ve seen students needlessly replicate the entire process of going through airport security, the entire drive to the grocery store, someone\u2019s entire nighttime routine. We have two magical moves on the page that eliminate the need to do this. One is summary. You can write, \u201cIt\u2019s a plan,\u201d he said. They firmed up the details and then he hung up, finished his cigarette, and went to find Margot. The other is just plain skipping ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s a plan,\u201d he said. Ten minutes later, he was on Margot\u2019s doorstep, coughing from his cigarette-induced emphysema. Share 9) It\u2019s fun to make people think they\u2019re seeing one thing and then zoom out like \u201cHa ha, you fool, it was something else!\u201d People totally love that! I usually hate this even in movies. Someone is finally giving the heartfelt speech they need to give, but then we zoom out and Psych! they were only rehearsing it in the mirror. These are called visual reveal shots or pullback reveals , and when they work, that\u2019s why they work\u2014because they\u2019re visual. an example from the web comic Oglaf , by Trudy Cooper and Doug Bayne I do love a surprise narrative shift, as in Life of Pi , in which we learn the narrator hasn\u2019t been entirely straightforward; or one like in Ian McEwan\u2019s Atonement , in which the narrative turns out not to be what we thought it was. But both of those are fundamentally different than, say, learning that the person our point-of-view character has been dealing with throughout the novel is (surprise!) her daughter, and both of them knew it all along. That just becomes withholding , and it\u2019s a point of view failure. 10) Everyone can hear the music in your head! I love a great movie soundtrack. I particularly love modern TV ending an episode with the absolute dead-on perfect song. (Think \u201cYou Are Sixteen\u201d ending that one episode of Mad Men .) But there are fiction writers out there trying so hard to give their novels a soundtrack for ambience or coolness, and it mostly doesn\u2019t work. Mad Men , 2007-2015, Lionsgate Television And it\u2019s one thing if you mention songs just about everyone can hear in their heads, like \u201cOur Love is Here to Stay\u201d or \u201cLet It Be\u201d (without quoting them, please, unless you want to shell out thousands of dollars, since those songs are not in public domain\u2026) but it\u2019s another if you can\u2019t stop name-dropping your favorite fringe bands. (A notable exception would be when the story is about music and about those lesser-known bands or even made-up bands\u2014e.g., Nick Hornby\u2019s High Fidelity. ) Those songs are probably deeply evocative for the author, but most readers just feel nothing at best and excluded at worst. Share 11) A story is always made entirely of scenes, with very little summary! Someone needs to write a doctoral dissertation about American literature coming of age with cinema and adopting a scene-scene-scene-scene structure that is of course not the only mode of storytelling. But in brief: Other traditions use more summary, more meandering exposition. And other eras in history relied far less on scene. Writing scene-based fiction is absolutely fine\u2014it\u2019s what I mostly love to read and write\u2014but it\u2019s important to know it\u2019s not your only choice. 12) Memories are full transportations back in time that you need to be startled out of! Of all these, this might be my biggest pet peeve. And this topic is complicated enough that it deserves its own post, which I\u2019ll be doing soon. But in brief: When you have a memory, do you stare into space while you\u2019re transported back in time, where you then relive the memory precisely, in full chronological order, until someone calls your name and \u201cstartles you out of your reverie\u201d? No?? Then (with love) why the hell are you writing memory that way? And why, to begin with, are you assuming that every glimpse into the past has to come through the vehicle of character memory rather than just being offered in narration? Ted Striker remembers the war. Airplane (1980, Paramount Pictures) You\u2019re doing it because you\u2019re copying film and its limitations. For absolutely no reason at all. More on all that (and other options) soon. BUT! There are some things we can absolutely learn from screenwriters, craft elements it\u2019s often easier to observe onscreen. Like for instance\u2026 1) Clear, clear, clear stakes help hook people in. Watch any cheesy reality show and they\u2019ll remind you again and again what\u2019s at stake and why it matters to people. Will Agatha pick the $500 more conservative wedding dress her conservative mother wants, or the $15,000 dress that makes her look like a deranged mermaid but will thrill her creepy fianc\u00e9 and make her feel hot even if she can\u2019t breathe in it? Find out after the break! When you see the interview portions of a show like Top Chef , you can tell the producers have asked questions like \u201cWhy can\u2019t you go home this week?\u201d and \u201cWho would be proud if you won?\u201d and \u201cWhat are you afraid of right now?\u201d Fiction is often going to approach this much more subtly, but at any point in your story it\u2019s helpful if both you and the reader have an understanding of what success would look like for your characters, and what the worst case scenario would be. 2) Every scene is there for a reason. It\u2019s quite hard to find a throw-away scene, or a redundant scene, on film\u2026 because everything costs a lot of money . If there\u2019s a pointless scene that shows people doing stuff they\u2019ve already done, someone is going to notice and cut it before millions of dollars get spent. While you do have that lovely unlimited budget, theres a lot to learn here from those who don\u2019t. You\u2019re spending space and time, if not money. Don\u2019t waste either of those. 3) Even then, amazing stuff gets cut. We lost something beautiful when they stopped making DVDs with directors\u2019 commentary and directors\u2019 cuts. I (no joke) learned more about writing from a Darren Starr voiceover commentary on one Sex and the City episode than I learned in several writing classes. I\u2019ll tell you about it another day. But it was always so useful to see the cut scenes, to see what they did spend big money to shoot and then still cut . The Gosford Park DVD had these gorgeous scenes with an entire cut storyline for Derek Jacobi\u2019s character, a character that was reduced to a stolid, nearly dialogueless butler in the final cut. And they were amazing scenes! Starring Derek Frickin Jacobi! Just about all that\u2019s left of Jacobi\u2019s performance in Gosford Park ( 2001, Focus Features) The thing is, the better you get at writing, the better the content is that you have to cut\u2014which hurts. Let\u2019s assume Shakespeare cut a lot of beautiful lines that didn\u2019t ultimately serve the play. Imagine Shakespeare balling up the page\u2014a page that contained literal lines of Shakespeare!! \u2014and tossing it into the fire. You can\u2019t witness that firsthand, but you can see the scenes that took days of filming and passion and talent and money, and that ultimately weren\u2019t essential. 4) Structural expectation can be a form of momentum. Anyone who\u2019s ever gotten hooked into a Top Ten Videos of 1992 countdown or a House Hunters episode or a season of Love is Blind knows the experience of not even really wanting to watch this, but feeling almost contractually obligated to see this thing through to the end of the promised setup. We could call that \u201cstructural momentum.\u201d Some writers make quite literal use of this force, writing stories structured like lists or ones that adhere to a formula (like the romance novel) with strong structural expectations. But there are other ways to harness this, too. For instance, Ford Madox Ford\u2019s The Good Soldier begins: \u201cThis is the saddest story I have ever heard.\u201d We\u2019ve been promised something, and now we want to read not just for the intrinsic plot, but to see why it\u2019s so sad. Or think of something like Dickens\u2019s A Christmas Carol , in which he uses two kinds of structural momentum: First there\u2019s the promise that Scrooge will be visited by three ghosts, and so we can\u2019t look away till we\u2019ve met all three; and then there\u2019s the countdown to Christmas morning, the structure of Christmas itself, another expected arrival we can\u2019t look away from. This is what the folks who produce reality shows are obnoxiously good at. ( Only five days left till the weddings! Will they say \u2018I do,\u2019 or walk away forever? ) The next time we\u2019re sucked in, we can at least learn from it. Let\u2019s keep brainstorming\u2026 In the comments, please tell me other things you\u2019ve learned, or had to unlearn, from film. And please recommend some good movies to me\u2026 I\u2019m about to have a long plane flight and need a well-written distraction.",

Jane Austen gives us the lovely dialogue &#8220;I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow,&#8221; but you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find someone gazing deeply into someone else&#8217;s brown eyes. Yet do a Control+F on &#8220;eyes&#8221; in any mediocre modern novel and you&#8217;ll get not only &#8220;I stared into his soft green eyes&#8221; but also a constant commentary on where someone is looking. (&#8220;He cast his eyes to the floor,&#8221; &#8220;Her eyes met Ralph&#8217;s,&#8221; &#8220;He glanced toward the audience,&#8221; etc.) So&#8230; What changed around 120 years ago to make us so obsessed with eyes? </p><p>Film happened. Specifically, two things: The closeup shot on an actor&#8217;s eyes to telegraph emotion (self-explanatory), and the &#8220;shot-reverse&#8221; shot, which might need some explanation. This is the film editing technique wherein a two-person conversation is filmed over the shoulder from one side, then the other side. In order for us to believe  they&#8217;re really talking to each other, and for a sense of spatial continuity, the director makes sure characters are matching the &#8220;eyeline.&#8221; </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!96ZC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc04cc054-60cd-4bcc-8065-a54d555acf24_2000x502.webp\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!96ZC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc04cc054-60cd-4bcc-8065-a54d555acf24_2000x502.webp\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">This example (from <em>Burn After Reading</em>) is from Studiobinder.com</figcaption></figure></div><p>That&#8217;s all fun stuff, but there&#8217;s no reason we need to bring that fixation to the page.

You&#8217;re going to have to get all the context across through dialogue, little clues, maybe someone conveniently turning on the TV news at the exact right moment so the newscaster can give an update on the relevant situation. You want to show a lot of time going by? You have to show the seasons changing or all the calendar pages flipping. You want us to know it&#8217;s someone&#8217;s last day of high school, and this character is his older brother? You need for the older brother to say &#8220;Heyyy, little brother, congrats on your last day of high school!&#8221; </p><p>On the page, we have this amazing thing called exposition. The narrator <em>can just tell people stuff</em>. It&#8217;s the coolest trick. If you ignore that, and you teach us information by having a character say &#8220;Hi there, neighbor! Haven&#8217;t seen you since the funeral. How are you getting on without your wife, the big-shot lawyer? I hear the big 6-0 is coming up!&#8221; we&#8217;re going to kind of hate you. </p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">SubMakk is a reader-supported publication.

That works really well! But you don&#8217;t have camera zooms or music or Jodi Foster&#8217;s face helping your story. So you need to tell us what someone&#8217;s thinking. <a href=\"https://rebeccamakkai.substack.com/p/go-deep\">Hey, here&#8217;s an entire series I wrote on interiority! </a></p><p>I don&#8217;t always blame this move on film consumption. Both journalists and lawyers, turning to fiction, have a hard time suddenly being allowed to put thoughts in someone&#8217;s head. This would be irresponsible journalism, and in a courtroom you&#8217;d get called out for speculation. </p><p>I also blame both this one and the one above on people hearing &#8220;show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; and assuming it means they&#8217;re essentially supposed to write a screenplay. &#8220;Show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; is largely applicable to emotion. If a student writes <em>He displayed rage</em> or <em>She acted embarrassed</em>, I&#8217;m likely to write <em>Show this plz?</em> in the margins. What it does <em>not</em> mean is that you&#8217;re not allowed to give us exposition or interiority. Neglect those tools at your peril. </p><h4>5) It&#8217;s easy to acclimate people quickly to a complicated, unfamiliar setting! </h4><p>You want to set your movie in a futuristic New York where every building has a flying car port on top and there are highways through the air and half the people are genetically modified to be 7 feet tall and the sky is red and everyone&#8217;s left hand is a phone and all the police are robots? Cool&#8212;that will take you all of about ten seconds to get across onscreen. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ch1Y!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f548e4d-4610-4298-9f5c-5b33c779ef9c_1245x700.webp\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"275.5020080321285\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ch1Y!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f548e4d-4610-4298-9f5c-5b33c779ef9c_1245x700.webp\" width=\"490\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><em>Lord of the Rings</em>, 2001 credit: New Line Cinema</figcaption></figure></div><p>You want to do all that stuff on the page? You&#8217;ve got tougher options. Some writers think they&#8217;re going to get away with devoting about ten seconds worth of space to establishing the context, or not mention it at all until it&#8217;s way too late. Because it&#8217;s never mentioned in the movies, it just <em>is</em>! Other writers try to take the time necessary to let us see, in detail, everything we&#8217;d see on the screen in ten seconds, and that turns out to be around thirty pages&#8212;because on the page, everything needs to be explained. Readers will want to know exactly what those air highways look like and how they work and maybe even where they came from. </p><p>So what are we supposed to do? It helps to weave those descriptions in on a need-to-know basis (e.g., the first time a cop shows up we learn about the robots), and it helps to simplify. What might have been colorful texture onscreen just takes too much of a reader&#8217;s energy, and it turns out we don&#8217;t really need those robocops after all to make the story work. </p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://rebeccamakkai.substack.com/p/youre-writing-a-book-so-stop-writing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><h4>6) Or!

But in brief: Other traditions use more summary, more meandering exposition. And other eras in history relied far less on scene.

And this topic is complicated enough that it deserves its own post, which I&#8217;ll be doing soon. But in brief: When you have a memory, do you stare into space while you&#8217;re transported back in time, where you then relive the memory precisely, in full chronological order, until someone calls your name and &#8220;startles you out of your reverie&#8221;? No?? Then (with love) why the hell are you writing memory that way?

For absolutely no reason at all. More on all that (and other options) soon.</p><p></p><p>BUT! There are some things we can absolutely learn from screenwriters, craft elements it&#8217;s often easier to observe onscreen. </p><p>Like for instance&#8230; </p><h4>1) Clear, clear, clear stakes help hook people in. </h4><p>Watch any cheesy reality show and they&#8217;ll remind you again and again what&#8217;s at stake and why it matters to people. <em>Will Agatha pick the $500 more conservative wedding dress her conservative mother wants, or the $15,000 dress that makes her look like a deranged mermaid but will thrill her creepy fianc&#233; and make her feel hot even if she can&#8217;t breathe in it? Find out after the break! </em>When you see the interview portions of a show like <em>Top Chef</em>, you can tell the producers have asked questions like &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you go home this week?&#8221; and &#8220;Who would be proud if you won?&#8221; and &#8220;What are you afraid of right now?&#8221; </p><p>Fiction is often going to approach this much more subtly, but at any point in your story it&#8217;s helpful if both you and the reader have an understanding of what success would look like for your characters, and what the worst case scenario would be. </p><h4>2) Every scene is there for a reason.</h4><p>It&#8217;s quite hard to find a throw-away scene, or a redundant scene, on film&#8230; because <em>everything costs a lot of money</em>. If there&#8217;s a pointless scene that shows people doing stuff they&#8217;ve already done, someone is going to notice and cut it before millions of dollars get spent.</p><p>While you <em>do</em> have that lovely unlimited budget, theres a lot to learn here from those who don&#8217;t. You&#8217;re spending space and time, if not money. Don&#8217;t waste either of those. </p><h4>3) Even then, amazing stuff gets cut.</h4><p>We lost something beautiful when they stopped making DVDs with directors&#8217; commentary and directors&#8217; cuts. I (no joke) learned more about writing from a Darren Starr voiceover commentary on one <em>Sex and the City</em> episode than I learned in several writing classes. I&#8217;ll tell you about it another day. But it was always so useful to see the cut scenes, to see what they did spend big money to shoot <em>and then still cut</em>. The <em>Gosford Park</em> DVD had these gorgeous scenes with an entire cut storyline for Derek Jacobi&#8217;s character, a character that was reduced to a stolid, nearly dialogueless butler in the final cut. And they were amazing scenes! Starring Derek Frickin Jacobi! </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bhZr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c6f0b34-16d3-49d5-970c-614f2abfbe2c_800x542.webp\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"369.915\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bhZr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c6f0b34-16d3-49d5-970c-614f2abfbe2c_800x542.webp\" width=\"546\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Just about all that&#8217;s left of Jacobi&#8217;s performance in <em>Gosford Park (</em>2001, Focus Features)</figcaption></figure></div><p>The thing is, the better you get at writing, the better the content is that you have to cut&#8212;which hurts. Let&#8217;s assume Shakespeare cut a lot of beautiful lines that didn&#8217;t ultimately serve the play. Imagine Shakespeare balling up the page&#8212;a page that contained <em>literal lines of Shakespeare!!</em>&#8212;and tossing it into the fire. You can&#8217;t witness that firsthand, but you <em>can</em> see the scenes that took days of filming and passion and talent and money, and that ultimately weren&#8217;t essential. </p><h4>4) Structural expectation can be a form of momentum. </h4><p>Anyone who&#8217;s ever gotten hooked into a Top Ten Videos of 1992 countdown or a <em>House Hunters</em> episode or a season of <em>Love is Blind</em> knows the experience of not even really wanting to watch this, but feeling almost contractually obligated to see this thing through to the end of the promised setup. We could call that &#8220;structural momentum.&#8221;</p><p>Some writers make quite literal use of this force, writing stories structured like lists or ones that adhere to a formula (like the romance novel) with strong structural expectations. But there are other ways to harness this, too. For instance, Ford Madox Ford&#8217;s <em>The Good Soldier </em>begins: &#8220;This is the saddest story I have ever heard.&#8221; We&#8217;ve been promised something, and now we want to read not just for the intrinsic plot, but to see why it&#8217;s so sad. Or think of something like Dickens&#8217;s <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, in which he uses two kinds of structural momentum: First there&#8217;s the promise that Scrooge will be visited by three ghosts, and so we can&#8217;t look away till we&#8217;ve met all three; and then there&#8217;s the countdown to Christmas morning, the structure of Christmas itself, another expected arrival we can&#8217;t look away from. </p><p>This is what the folks who produce reality shows are obnoxiously good at. (<em>Only five days left till the weddings! Will they say &#8216;I do,&#8217; or walk away forever?</em>) The next time we&#8217;re sucked in, we can at least learn from it.</p><h4>Let&#8217;s keep brainstorming&#8230; </h4><p>In the comments, please tell me other things you&#8217;ve learned, or had to unlearn, from film. And please recommend some good movies to me&#8230; I&#8217;m about to have a long plane flight and need a well-written distraction. </p>"

It\u2019s a biography of Virginia Faulkner, a writer even many followers of this site have never heard of. So, a book about a woman nobody\u2019s ever heard of by a writer who\u2019s never published a book before is pretty much a guarantee that I will end up featuring it here someday. How did I come to spend much of the last five years writing about Virginia Faulkner? Well, it all started here, actually. Long ago (How Long? Over 17 years), I mentioned a book called My Hey-Day, or The Crack-up of the International Set , which purported to be the memoirs of one Princess Tulip Murphy as related by Virginia Faulkner in a short post catching up on recent neglected reading . As I often do, I did a little research to find out about the author. From her entry in Contemporary Authors (New Revision Series) Volume 11 , I learned that she was born in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1913; attended Radcliffe for one year; worked for the Washington Post , Town and Country magazine in New York, and MGM in Hollywood; wrote several novels and a Broadway play in addition to My Hey-Day ; then worked as an editor at the University of Nebraska Press from 1956 until her death in 1980. That last bit stuck in my head. It seemed an odd trajectory: Washington, New York City, Hollywood \u2026 and then the University of Nebraska Press? Virginia Faulkner\u2019s entry in Contemporary Authors (New Revision Series), Vol. 11 . In early 2020, I was taking Ian Thomson\u2019s seminar in the MA Biography/Creative Nonfiction program at the University of East Anglia, I decided to take a closer look into Virginia Faulkner\u2019s life for an assignment requiring us to incorporate media in our essays. The paper I turned in, \u201cVirginia Faulkner: A Life in Clippings,\u201d was a sprint through her first twenty-some years as told through headlines and quotes from various Lincoln, Nebraska newspapers culled from Newspapers.com . From the photo in an article on her midnight marriage and its later annulment, I leaped to the conclusion that she was gay. The similar between her haircut and clothes and those of the then-famous English lesbian Radclyffe Hall, whose novel The Well of Loneliness had been ruled not obscene by a US court in 1929, seemed an obvious indication of her sexuality. Photo of Virginia Faulkner, from the New York Daily News , Wednesday, 15 May 1935, p. 14. I didn\u2019t have the word count allowance to cover Faulkner\u2019s whole life using this approach, and I would probably have left her story unfinished had the pandemic and the U.K. lockdown not intervened. But when I considered what was required to research and complete a dissertation (or thesis, as it\u2019s called in the U.S.) in the course of the next six months, I realized that my Plan A, to write a biography of G. E. (Gertrude) Trevelyan, was no longer viable, and I looked for subjects I could address purely through virtual research. That odd trajectory \u2014 Washington, New York City, Hollywood, Lincoln, Nebraska \u2014 kept coming back as a mystery begging to be solved, so I began to survey what would be involved in collecting evidence. Virginia Faulkner, Polly Adler, an unidentified man, and Dana Suesse, from mid-1940s. At that point, I stumbled through an extraordinarily lucky series of coincidences. Finding a photo of Faulkner with the composer Dana Suesse and the once-notorious New York City madam, Polly Adler, in the collection of the Kansas City Library that I might use, I asked for permissions and was referred to Suesse\u2019s executor, Peter Mintun, whose name I remembered as a singer and pianist from the time we lived in the San Francisco area. Peter not only generously agreed, but as we discussed my research, passed along several contacts he thought might help. One was a woman named Samantha Shada who\u2019d done some research into Faulkner herself. When I contacted Samantha, she not only added to my growing list of contacts but emailed me two batches of Faulkner\u2019s personal letters that she\u2019d had scanned by the Special Collections staff at the University of Nebraska Lincoln library. The letters dated from 1930, when Virginia left her home in Lincoln for the first time, to attend an exclusive girls\u2019 finishing school in Rome, and stopped in late 1935, not long after Virginia had arrived in Hollywood to work for MGM. Some of the letters were typed, others were handwritten, but all shone with intelligence and bubbled with wisecracks and self-deprecating remarks. A few were in a different hand and almost indecipherable. These I skipped, but after reading the rest, I knew I had to share this remarkable sensibility with others. Virginia \u2014 and I now felt comfortable referring to her on a first-name basis \u2014 was one of history\u2019s great letter writers. In 1930, while still settling in at Miss Moxley\u2019s school in Rome, she wrote her brother, Eddie: \u201cYou know how I used to be finicky about my food? If I thought a human hair was involved in a viand I was consuming, I would very nearly be sick at the table. Now, however, if I found a partially decomposed horse in the vermicelli, I would only make a slight mou\u00e9 of distaste and eat around it.\u201d If this was a sample of Virginia writing on a familiar basis, I dreamt of what other riches from 1936 and beyond that awaiting in the archives in Lincoln. I began to picture a collection of her letters that would put even her novels and magazine stories to shame. Another contact Peter Mintun shared was Debby Applegate, who was working on a biography of Polly Adler, the other woman with Virginia and Dana Suesse in that photo from the Kansas City library. I recognized Debby\u2019s name, as she was something of a legend for winning the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for biography with her first book, The Most Famous Man in America: The Biography of Henry Ward Beecher . Debby replied to my email with enthusiasm. She\u2019d looked into Virginia\u2019s life because in the early 1950s, Virginia spent the better part of a year turning a massive manuscript of Polly\u2019s autobiography, a manuscript that had been repeatedly rejected by publishers, into a book that became a global bestseller: A House is Not a Home . Debby not only shared her research notes on Virginia but directed me to a Lincoln collector who owned the one remaining notebook from Virginia\u2019s work on the book. Ron Hull, in a studio of Nebraska Public Media, 2022. Among the people Samantha Shada referred me to was the person who proved most instrumental to the whole project. At the time I first called Ron Hull, he was a few weeks away from turning 90. I reached him at his office. Having come to Lincoln in 1955 \u2014 the same year Virginia returned to her hometown \u2014 he had by then spent almost 65 years developing and running educational television, first in Nebraska, then in Washington, D.C., Vietnam, and China, and then again in Nebraska, and he was still coming to work five days a week. Having been a close friend and colleague of Virginia throughout the second half of her life, he was full of stories about her and over the moon to know that someone was working on her biography, even as just a thesis. We talked several times for at least an hour in April and May 2020, and he was bubbling with enthusiasm. More than that, he talked to Donna Shear, then director of the University of Nebraska Press, and soon after, I was invited to submit a book proposal. Unknown first-time writers who haven\u2019t even finished a thesis don\u2019t often get such invitations, and that, more than anything else, is why Virginia Faulkner: A Life in Two Acts is now about to be published. The information I was able to collect virtually, including the invaluable collection of letters Samantha Shada provided, was enough for me to complete my thesis, which focused on Virginia\u2019s time in Rome, at Radcliffe, and in Washington, D.C. between 1930 and 1934, but as soon as my wife and I returned to the U.S. and archives began opening up, the in-person research had to get underway. I spent three weeks in Lincoln, going through Virginia\u2019s papers item by item, as well as the personal papers of her brother, Ed, and her partner, Bernice Slote, and those of others she worked with, including Robert Knoll, Mari Sandoz, and the novelist Wright Morris. It soon became apparent that Virginia\u2019s letters from 1936 on were lost forever. They weren\u2019t in her papers or in Ed\u2019s. In fact, Ed\u2019s papers contained no personal items from 1936 until the mid-1950s, and he had been meticulous in his record-keeping. What I learned from Rich Faulkner, Virginia\u2019s one surviving first cousin, was that Ed began storing papers for Virginia and Bernice \u2014 including records from Prairie Schooner \u2014 in his basement sometime in the 1970s, and at some point after that, his water heater leaked and dozens of boxes were damaged and thrown away. This made the challenge of piecing together Virginia\u2019s life between 1936 and 1955 all the more difficult. Fortunately, her papers included some of the notes she assembled during the three years she spent as a \u201cgirl hermit\u201d in Pacific Grove, California, becoming fascinated with the work of Willa Cather and divining, through close reading and psychological analysis rather than through access to any primary evidence, that Cather was a lesbian. This work followed a year Virginia spent in therapy and in a sanatorium in Michigan where she likely received multiple rounds of electro-convulsive treatments, and her notes revealed an obsessive level of interest in hidden messages and overloaded symbolism that would not have withstood scrutiny by any competent scholar. Excerpt from Virginia Faulkner\u2019s notebook for A House is Not a Home . The visit to Lincoln also allowed me to contact the collector who had the one surviving notebook and other papers from Virginia\u2019s work on A House is Not a Home , and I spent a day reading and scanning the material. The shorthand explanation of what Virginia did for Polly is that she ghost-wrote the memoirs, but what the notebook shows is that it would be more accurate to say she ghost-edited them. What she did wasn\u2019t that different from what Maxwell Perkins did for Thomas Wolfe with the manuscript of You Can\u2019t Go Home Again : she cut and structured the material into a coherent narrative, adding historical context and \u2014 crucial to potential publishers \u2014 making sure that the book was libel-proof. It was a dry run of what Virginia would do time and again when she became an editor with the University of Nebraska Press. Most of Virginia\u2019s papers in the UN-Lincoln library Special Collections related to her work for the press: correspondence with authors as she guided them along the path from proposal to publishable manuscript. There were two classes of authors for Virginia, based on the tone she adopted in her letters. The majority were academics who might be experts in their field but had not the slightest idea of how to put a half-decent book together. At times, especially in the case of William Curtin, whose collection of Willa Cather\u2019s early journalism, The World and the Parish , took almost a decade to complete, her temper was tested to the breaking point. Her frustration and near-contempt is palpable in the letters from the last months before publication and likely drove Curtin into a long period of depression. In a few cases, however, when Virginia was satisfied that an author had both the intellectual rigor and the writing skills required of her benchmarks for the press, her tone was warm, informal, and peppered with her characteristic wisecracks. She and Wright Morris, whose books the press began reissuing in the late 1960s in its Bison Books paperback series, hit it off from the beginning. It helped that his books were already written, but Virginia came to think of Morris as Nebraska\u2019s best writer (after Cather, of course) and the two shared a love of cocktails and unveiled sarcasm. Her most intimate tone could be heard in her correspondence with Hazel Barnes, a professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado Boulder and an expert on Sartre and the existentialists. Barnes was a lesbian in a long-term partnership with another member of the faculty and it was clear that Virginia respected not only her scholarship but her ability to navigate institutional waters at a time when there was little tolerance of anything but the most conventional heterosexual relationships. Barnes made a point to stop in Lincoln on her trips to and from the east and she and her partner Doris Schwalbe became close friends of Virginia and Bernice Slote. Hazel Barnes\u2019s baby shoes, from her papers at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The sympathy between the two women was such that I decided to stop in Boulder on my way back from Nebraska and take a look through Hazel Barnes\u2019s papers. It was a hunch that paid off. In the dozen or so boxes containing everything from manuscripts to a pair of Barnes\u2019s baby shoes, I found a letter from August 1963, typed by Virginia at home and when she was several drinks into her evening, in which she contemplates seducing a faculty wife and second-guessing her decision to stay in Lincoln, effectively putting her career as a writer behind her: I see now that it was a major mistake for me to stop being a writer and try to be a people. I can\u2019t think why I would have anyway, except from despair. So now since 1956 I have tried to be a people and screw that. It is a waste of energy. People are slobs, and they don\u2019t care, they never make anything, they are dandruff and snot. Virginia closes by acknowledging her unique trust in Barnes: \u201cI am responsible for myself; telling you what I feel is a prized luxury. Let me have it.\u201d Excerpt from Feb. 3, 1941 letter from Dana Suesse to her mother. Virginia\u2019s first partnership was with Dana Suesse, and I had to wait almost a year before Suesse\u2019s papers became available at the Library of Congress. \u201cI am on my way now to have tea with Virginia Faulkner,\u201d Dana Suesse wrote her mother on the morning of February 1, 1941. \u201cShe is one of the most brilliant girls I have met in a long while. I adore her books.\u201d That was the start of a relationship that lasted for much of the 1940s, and given the loss of Virginia\u2019s letters from this time, any clues to their partnership and Virginia\u2019s life during this period would have to come from Suesse\u2019s papers. Luckily, Suesse provided two priceless aids to the researcher. First, for much of her life, she kept small pocket agendas with her daily activities and appointments. From these, I learned, for example, that Dana moved into Virginia\u2019s Manhattan apartment on October 11, 1941. In addition, Dana wrote to her mother at least once a week, except when they lived a short drive apart in Connecticut, and often passed along news of Virginia \u2014 even after Dana moved to Paris to study with the legendary composition teacher Nadia Boulanger. It was from the Paris letters that I learned that Virginia admitted herself to the Haven, an exclusive sanatorium in Rochester, Michigan, sometime in the late summer of 1949. Virginia was, by all accounts, a heavy drinker if not a functional alcoholic, but she also suffered from periods of crippling depressions and self-doubt. The first record of these could be found in those cryptic letters included in the PDFs passed along by Samantha Shada. Once I took the time to decipher and transcribe them, I saw that they were written to Ed Faulkner by Evelyn Merriman, a former teacher at the Moxley School in Rome. Merriam had come to New York from the private girls\u2019 school in Connecticut where she was now teaching to visit Virginia, who had recently arrived to launch her career. She found Virginia in a panic, worried that she would not be able to make a living or even be taken seriously as a writer, and she reached out to Ed for help. Within a few days, Merriman felt that the crisis had passed and wrote Ed that she was returning to Connecticut, but there were clues to other episodes of depression over the following years. Dana Suesse\u2019s letters to her mother provided some insight into Virginia\u2019s mental health problems and her time at the Haven, but these were supplemented by several dozen letters that avoided the deluge in Ed Faulkner\u2019s basement. These were to Ann Watkins, Polly Adler\u2019s literary agent, and are found in the Special Collections at Columbia University. Dana Suesse, newly returned from Paris, brought Virginia together with Adler after her release from the Haven in the summer of 1950. Knowing of Polly\u2019s struggles to find a publisher, as well as of the problems with Polly\u2019s manuscript, Dana thought Virginia might work with Polly to put the book into publishable shape. Virginia agreed to take on the job, but she was wary of Polly\u2019s force-of-nature personality and insisted on working without a contract or a fee. It would take almost two years to finish what started as a few weeks\u2019 task, and over the course of that time, Virginia left New York and spent time in intensive outpatient treatment with psychiatrists in Detroit and Milwaukee, as well as what was likely another round of ECT at the state asylum in Hastings, Nebraska, before finding refuge in Pacific Grove. Although incidental to her work on A House is Not a Home , Virginia\u2019s updates about her status in the letters to Watkins are the sole surviving records from that year of wandering. Excerpt from Virginia Faulkner letter to Ann Watkins, March 13, 1952. After finishing work on A House is Not a Home , Virginia turned her energies into her Cather project, working for over two years on numerous notebooks full of quotations from Cather, Jung, and the few books about Cather published since her death in 1947 \u2014 of which only the one notebook in the UN Lincoln Special Collections still survives. She shared her findings in a few letters brimming with excitement that she sent to Bill Koshland, an editor at Alfred A. Knopf she knew from her days in New York. Koshland\u2019s replies were encouraging but cautious. Cather was one of the authors Alfred Knopf held closest to his heart and Koshland knew that Knopf and Cather\u2019s executor and partner, Edith Lewis, would cut off cooperation with Virginia completely if they got wind of her project. As it was, Virginia\u2019s Cather project came to an end when she left Pacific Grove and returned to Lincoln. Although it wasn\u2019t clear at first what Virginia\u2019s next step would be. Rumors in Lincoln were that her brother Ed had brought her back because she was going broke or going on benders or going in some direction that he worried would lead to ruin. But an accidental meeting with Emily Schossberger, director of the University of Nebraska Press, led to a job of assembling a Nebraska anthology, eventually called Roundup , and the work on Roundup led to a full-time position as editor and, after 1961, editor in chief. Skeptical at first about Lincoln \u2014 she used to joke that people there complained that her novels \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough pictures\u201d \u2014 Virginia found the work at the press more fulfilling than the work of churning out witty magazine fiction had been prior to her time at the Haven. And she soon realized that her position enabled her to return to her Cather project from a different angle. Instead of trying to psychoanalyze Cather, she began a long-term campaign to provide Cather with the kind of foundation that supports an author\u2019s place in the canon: authoritative, annotated texts and serious critical studies of her work. With Bernice Slote, a UN Lincoln professor of English who became her partner and chief collaborator in the early 1960s, Virginia collected much of Cather\u2019s earliest work in a series of books published by the UN Press, and by the early 1970s, the two were considered leading Cather experts. Their efforts culminated in the first international conference on Cather\u2019s work, held in Lincoln and Red Cloud, Nebraska, marking Cather\u2019s centenary in 1973. Virginia and Bernice\u2019s commitment to the cause of advancing Cather as a great writer, however, led them to resist \u2014 first dismissively and then doggedly \u2014 efforts by a new generation of scholars to acknowledge and celebrate Cather\u2019s sexuality. From having \u201cuncovered\u201d Cather as a lesbian in her motel room in Pacific Grove in the early 1950s, Virginia had become a leader among the Cather reactionaries. In part, this was to protect the trust of the Cather family members who took over the writer\u2019s estate after the death of Edith Lewis. In March of 1980, Virginia wrote Cather\u2019s niece Helen Cather Southwick, who had become increasingly concerned over work making prominent mention of Cather as a lesbian. She assured Southwick that she and Bernice would closely scrutinize any book or article that highlighted Cather\u2019s sexuality, and if they felt its scholarship wasn\u2019t up to snuff, to \u201cblow it out of the water.\u201d Virginia then tried to argue that the \u201clesbian label\u201d was often applied as a way to diminish a great woman\u2019s work. Excerpt from a letter from Virginia Faulkner to Helen Cather Southwick, March 12, 1980. Virginia\u2019s time in academic publishing had convinced her that she lacked the education and discipline to undertake a serious study of Cather\u2019s life and work, but she was convinced that Bernice Slote could and would. And so did many in the community of Cather scholars. Among Bernice\u2019s papers are letters from people looking forward to her \u201cauthoritative biography,\u201d and she received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to support her research. But when Virginia died suddenly in September 1980, Bernice \u2014 who had already suffered a major stroke \u2014 found it difficult to muster the energy to take the project forward. Though she resumed teaching for a while, Bernice never again published as an academic, and after a second stroke in late 1982, she was confined to a nursing home, where she died in February 1983. Bernice Slote and Virginia Faulkner in the late 1970s. In the course of researching Virginia Faulkner\u2019s life, I realized that my task was not, as I thought originally, to write a literary biography. A literary biography \u2014 such as the one Bernice Slote might have written \u2014 tries to illuminate a writer\u2019s work through the context of their life. In Virginia\u2019s case, however, her novels and short stories, however funny and well-crafted, were simply not of the caliber to merit close critical study. Though she was often referred to as \u201cthe next Dorothy Parker\u201d in the 1930s, the fact is that Dorothy Parker was not just a woman with a quick wit and sharp tongue but a writer who produced short stories (in particular) of lasting value, while many of Virginia\u2019s stories are throwaway accounts of the bickering of idle rich married couples. The reason for writing Virginia\u2019s story was simpler than to illuminate her work: it was to tell her story, the story of a woman of ferocious wit and intelligence who struggled with alcoholism and depression and had the courage to start again at the age of 42, setting aside her own career as a writer and devoting her energy to advancing the work of Willa Cather and the numerous writers she guided as an editor of genius. It was, as that letter to Hazel Barnes shows, a decision she doubted at times, but one she persevered with, to her credit and that of the press and the writers she believed in. I hope that readers will agree that it\u2019s a story well worth telling. Virginia Faulkner: A Life in Two Acts is available for pre-orders now from the University of Nebraska Press: Link .",

It&#8217;s a biography of Virginia Faulkner, a writer even many followers of this site have never heard of. So, a book about a woman nobody&#8217;s ever heard of by a writer who&#8217;s never published a book before is pretty much a guarantee that I will end up featuring it here someday.</p>\n<p>How did I come to spend much of the last five years writing about Virginia Faulkner? Well, it all started here, actually.</p>\n<p>Long ago (How Long? Over 17 years), I mentioned a book called <em>My Hey-Day, or The Crack-up of the International Set</em>, which purported to be the memoirs of one Princess Tulip Murphy as related by Virginia Faulkner in <a href=\"https://neglectedbooks.com/?p=192\">a short post catching up on recent neglected reading</a>. As I often do, I did a little research to find out about the author. From <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/contemporaryauth0011cont/page/196/mode/2up?q=%22faulkner+virginia%22\">her entry</a> in <em>Contemporary Authors (New Revision Series) Volume 11</em>, I learned that she was born in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1913; attended Radcliffe for one year; worked for the <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Town and Country</em> magazine in New York, and MGM in Hollywood; wrote several novels and a Broadway play in addition to <em>My Hey-Day</em>; then worked as an editor at the University of Nebraska Press from 1956 until her death in 1980. That last bit stuck in my head. It seemed an odd trajectory: Washington, New York City, Hollywood &#8230; and then the University of Nebraska Press?</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_10909\" style=\"width: 640px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10909\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://neglectedbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/faulkner-contemp-authors-1984.jpg\" width=\"650\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-10909\">Virginia Faulkner&#8217;s entry in <em>Contemporary Authors (New Revision Series), Vol. 11</em>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In early 2020, I was taking Ian Thomson&#8217;s seminar in the MA Biography/Creative Nonfiction program at the University of East Anglia, I decided to take a closer look into Virginia Faulkner&#8217;s life for an assignment requiring us to incorporate media in our essays. The paper I turned in, &#8220;Virginia Faulkner: A Life in Clippings,&#8221; was a sprint through her first twenty-some years as told through headlines and quotes from various Lincoln, Nebraska newspapers culled from <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/\">Newspapers.com</a>. From the photo in an article on her midnight marriage and its later annulment, I leaped to the conclusion that she was gay. The similar between her haircut and clothes and those of the then-famous English lesbian Radclyffe Hall, whose novel <em>The Well of Loneliness</em> had been ruled not obscene by a US court in 1929, seemed an obvious indication of her sexuality.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_10902\" style=\"width: 227px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10902\" height=\"379\" src=\"https://neglectedbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vf_daily_news.png\" width=\"237\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-10902\">Photo of Virginia Faulkner, from the New York <em>Daily News</em>, Wednesday, 15 May 1935, p. 14.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have the word count allowance to cover Faulkner&#8217;s whole life using this approach, and I would probably have left her story unfinished had the pandemic and the U.K. lockdown not intervened. But when I considered what was required to research and complete a dissertation (or thesis, as it&#8217;s called in the U.S.) in the course of the next six months, I realized that my Plan A, to write a biography of G. E. (Gertrude) Trevelyan, was no longer viable, and I looked for subjects I could address purely through virtual research. That odd trajectory &#8212; Washington, New York City, Hollywood, Lincoln, Nebraska &#8212; kept coming back as a mystery begging to be solved, so I began to survey what would be involved in collecting evidence.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_10925\" style=\"width: 390px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10925\" height=\"558\" src=\"https://neglectedbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VF-Adler-Unknown-DS.jpg\" width=\"400\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-10925\">Virginia Faulkner, Polly Adler, an unidentified man, and Dana Suesse, from mid-1940s.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At that point, I stumbled through an extraordinarily lucky series of coincidences. Finding a photo of Faulkner with the composer Dana Suesse and the once-notorious New York City madam, Polly Adler, in the collection of the Kansas City Library that I might use, I asked for permissions and was referred to Suesse&#8217;s executor, Peter Mintun, whose name I remembered as a singer and pianist from the time we lived in the San Francisco area. Peter not only generously agreed, but as we discussed my research, passed along several contacts he thought might help. </p>\n<p>One was a woman named Samantha Shada who&#8217;d done some research into Faulkner herself.

I spent three weeks in Lincoln, going through Virginia&#8217;s papers item by item, as well as the personal papers of her brother, Ed, and her partner, Bernice Slote, and those of others she worked with, including Robert Knoll, Mari Sandoz, and the novelist Wright Morris. It soon became apparent that Virginia&#8217;s letters from 1936 on were lost forever. They weren&#8217;t in her papers or in Ed&#8217;s.

This made the challenge of piecing together Virginia&#8217;s life between 1936 and 1955 all the more difficult. Fortunately, her papers included some of the notes she assembled during the three years she spent as a &#8220;girl hermit&#8221; in Pacific Grove, California, becoming fascinated with the work of Willa Cather and divining, through close reading and psychological analysis rather than through access to any primary evidence, that Cather was a lesbian. This work followed a year Virginia spent in therapy and in a sanatorium in Michigan where she likely received multiple rounds of electro-convulsive treatments, and her notes revealed an obsessive level of interest in hidden messages and overloaded symbolism that would not have withstood scrutiny by any competent scholar.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_10920\" style=\"width: 690px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10920\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://neglectedbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vf-house-nb.jpg\" width=\"700\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-10920\">Excerpt from Virginia Faulkner&#8217;s notebook for <em>A House is Not a Home</em>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The visit to Lincoln also allowed me to contact the collector who had the one surviving notebook and other papers from Virginia&#8217;s work on <em>A House is Not a Home</em>, and I spent a day reading and scanning the material. The shorthand explanation of what Virginia did for Polly is that she ghost-wrote the memoirs, but what the notebook shows is that it would be more accurate to say she ghost-edited them. What she did wasn&#8217;t that different from what Maxwell Perkins did for Thomas Wolfe with the manuscript of <em>You Can&#8217;t Go Home Again</em>: she cut and structured the material into a coherent narrative, adding historical context and &#8212; crucial to potential publishers &#8212; making sure that the book was libel-proof. It was a dry run of what Virginia would do time and again when she became an editor with the University of Nebraska Press.</p>\n<p>Most of Virginia&#8217;s papers in the UN-Lincoln library Special Collections related to her work for the press: correspondence with authors as she guided them along the path from proposal to publishable manuscript. There were two classes of authors for Virginia, based on the tone she adopted in her letters. The majority were academics who might be experts in their field but had not the slightest idea of how to put a half-decent book together. At times, especially in the case of William Curtin, whose collection of Willa Cather&#8217;s early journalism, <em>The World and the Parish</em>, took almost a decade to complete, her temper was tested to the breaking point. Her frustration and near-contempt is palpable in the letters from the last months before publication and likely drove Curtin into a long period of depression.</p>\n<p>In a few cases, however, when Virginia was satisfied that an author had both the intellectual rigor and the writing skills required of her benchmarks for the press, her tone was warm, informal, and peppered with her characteristic wisecracks. She and Wright Morris, whose books the press began reissuing in the late 1960s in its Bison Books paperback series, hit it off from the beginning. It helped that his books were already written, but Virginia came to think of Morris as Nebraska&#8217;s best writer (after Cather, of course) and the two shared a love of cocktails and unveiled sarcasm. </p>\n<p>Her most intimate tone could be heard in her correspondence with Hazel Barnes, a professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado Boulder and an expert on Sartre and the existentialists. Barnes was a lesbian in a long-term partnership with another member of the faculty and it was clear that Virginia respected not only her scholarship but her ability to navigate institutional waters at a time when there was little tolerance of anything but the most conventional heterosexual relationships. Barnes made a point to stop in Lincoln on her trips to and from the east and she and her partner Doris Schwalbe became close friends of Virginia and Bernice Slote. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_10910\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10910\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://neglectedbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vf-hazel-barnes-baby-shoes.jpg\" width=\"600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-10910\">Hazel Barnes&#8217;s baby shoes, from her papers at the University of Colorado, Boulder.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The sympathy between the two women was such that I decided to stop in Boulder on my way back from Nebraska and take a look through Hazel Barnes&#8217;s papers. It was a hunch that paid off. In the dozen or so boxes containing everything from manuscripts to a pair of Barnes&#8217;s baby shoes, I found a letter from August 1963, typed by Virginia at home and when she was several drinks into her evening, in which she contemplates seducing a faculty wife and second-guessing her decision to stay in Lincoln, effectively putting her career as a writer behind her:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I see now that it was a major mistake for me to stop being a writer and try to be a people. I can\u2019t think why I would have anyway, except from despair. So now since 1956 I have tried to be a people and screw that. It is a waste of energy. People are slobs, and they don\u2019t care, they never make anything, they are dandruff and snot.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Virginia closes by acknowledging her unique trust in Barnes: \u201cI am responsible for myself; telling you what I feel is a prized luxury. Let me have it.\u201d</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_10912\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10912\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://neglectedbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vf-ds-to-mother.jpg\" width=\"600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-10912\">Excerpt from Feb. 3, 1941 letter from Dana Suesse to her mother.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Virginia&#8217;s first partnership was with Dana Suesse, and I had to wait almost a year before Suesse&#8217;s papers became available at the Library of Congress. \u201cI am on my way now to have tea with Virginia Faulkner,\u201d Dana Suesse wrote her mother on the morning of February 1, 1941. \u201cShe is one of the most brilliant girls I have met in a long while. I adore her books.\u201d That was the start of a relationship that lasted for much of the 1940s, and given the loss of Virginia&#8217;s letters from this time, any clues to their partnership and Virginia&#8217;s life during this period would have to come from Suesse&#8217;s papers. Luckily, Suesse provided two priceless aids to the researcher. First, for much of her life, she kept small pocket agendas with her daily activities and appointments. From these, I learned, for example, that Dana moved into Virginia&#8217;s Manhattan apartment on October 11, 1941. In addition, Dana wrote to her mother at least once a week, except when they lived a short drive apart in Connecticut, and often passed along news of Virginia &#8212; even after Dana moved to Paris to study with the legendary composition teacher Nadia Boulanger.</p>\n<p>It was from the Paris letters that I learned that Virginia admitted herself to the Haven, an exclusive sanatorium in Rochester, Michigan, sometime in the late summer of 1949. Virginia was, by all accounts, a heavy drinker if not a functional alcoholic, but she also suffered from periods of crippling depressions and self-doubt. The first record of these could be found in those cryptic letters included in the PDFs passed along by Samantha Shada. Once I took the time to decipher and transcribe them, I saw that they were written to Ed Faulkner by Evelyn Merriman, a former teacher at the Moxley School in Rome. Merriam had come to New York from the private girls&#8217; school in Connecticut where she was now teaching to visit Virginia, who had recently arrived to launch her career. She found Virginia in a panic, worried that she would not be able to make a living or even be taken seriously as a writer, and she reached out to Ed for help. Within a few days, Merriman felt that the crisis had passed and wrote Ed that she was returning to Connecticut, but there were clues to other episodes of depression over the following years.</p>\n<p>Dana Suesse&#8217;s letters to her mother provided some insight into Virginia&#8217;s mental health problems and her time at the Haven, but these were supplemented by several dozen letters that avoided the deluge in Ed Faulkner&#8217;s basement. These were to Ann Watkins, Polly Adler&#8217;s literary agent, and are found in the Special Collections at Columbia University. Dana Suesse, newly returned from Paris, brought Virginia together with Adler after her release from the Haven in the summer of 1950. Knowing of Polly&#8217;s struggles to find a publisher, as well as of the problems with Polly&#8217;s manuscript, Dana thought Virginia might work with Polly to put the book into publishable shape. Virginia agreed to take on the job, but she was wary of Polly&#8217;s force-of-nature personality and insisted on working without a contract or a fee. </p>\n<p>It would take almost two years to finish what started as a few weeks&#8217; task, and over the course of that time, Virginia left New York and spent time in intensive outpatient treatment with psychiatrists in Detroit and Milwaukee, as well as what was likely another round of ECT at the state asylum in Hastings, Nebraska, before finding refuge in Pacific Grove. Although incidental to her work on <em>A House is Not a Home</em>, Virginia&#8217;s updates about her status in the letters to Watkins are the sole surviving records from that year of wandering.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_10913\" style=\"width: 1014px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-10913\" height=\"594\" src=\"https://neglectedbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vf-to-ann-watkins-1024x594.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-10913\">Excerpt from Virginia Faulkner letter to Ann Watkins, March 13, 1952.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>After finishing work on <em>A House is Not a Home</em>, Virginia turned her energies into her Cather project, working for over two years on numerous notebooks full of quotations from Cather, Jung, and the few books about Cather published since her death in 1947 &#8212; of which only the one notebook in the UN Lincoln Special Collections still survives. She shared her findings in a few letters brimming with excitement that she sent to Bill Koshland, an editor at Alfred A. Knopf she knew from her days in New York. Koshland&#8217;s replies were encouraging but cautious. Cather was one of the authors Alfred Knopf held closest to his heart and Koshland knew that Knopf and Cather&#8217;s executor and partner, Edith Lewis, would cut off cooperation with Virginia completely if they got wind of her project.</p>\n<p>As it was, Virginia&#8217;s Cather project came to an end when she left Pacific Grove and returned to Lincoln. Although it wasn&#8217;t clear at first what Virginia&#8217;s next step would be. Rumors in Lincoln were that her brother Ed had brought her back because she was going broke or going on benders or going in some direction that he worried would lead to ruin. But an accidental meeting with Emily Schossberger, director of the University of Nebraska Press, led to a job of assembling a Nebraska anthology, eventually called <em>Roundup</em>, and the work on <em>Roundup</em> led to a full-time position as editor and, after 1961, editor in chief.</p>\n<p>Skeptical at first about Lincoln &#8212; she used to joke that people there complained that her novels &#8220;didn&#8217;t have enough pictures&#8221; &#8212; Virginia found the work at the press more fulfilling than the work of churning out witty magazine fiction had been prior to her time at the Haven. And she soon realized that her position enabled her to return to her Cather project from a different angle. Instead of trying to psychoanalyze Cather, she began a long-term campaign to provide Cather with the kind of foundation that supports an author&#8217;s place in the canon: authoritative, annotated texts and serious critical studies of her work. With Bernice Slote, a UN Lincoln professor of English who became her partner and chief collaborator in the early 1960s, Virginia collected much of Cather&#8217;s earliest work in a series of books published by the UN Press, and by the early 1970s, the two were considered leading Cather experts. Their efforts culminated in the first international conference on Cather&#8217;s work, held in Lincoln and Red Cloud, Nebraska, marking Cather&#8217;s centenary in 1973.</p>\n<p>Virginia and Bernice&#8217;s commitment to the cause of advancing Cather as a great writer, however, led them to resist &#8212; first dismissively and then doggedly &#8212; efforts by a new generation of scholars to acknowledge and celebrate Cather&#8217;s sexuality. From having &#8220;uncovered&#8221; Cather as a lesbian in her motel room in Pacific Grove in the early 1950s, Virginia had become a leader among the Cather reactionaries. In part, this was to protect the trust of the Cather family members who took over the writer&#8217;s estate after the death of Edith Lewis. In March of 1980, Virginia wrote Cather&#8217;s niece Helen Cather Southwick, who had become increasingly concerned over work making prominent mention of Cather as a lesbian. She assured Southwick that she and Bernice would closely scrutinize any book or article that highlighted Cather&#8217;s sexuality, and if they felt its scholarship wasn&#8217;t up to snuff, to &#8220;blow it out of the water.&#8221; Virginia then tried to argue that the &#8220;lesbian label&#8221; was often applied as a way to diminish a great woman&#8217;s work.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_10914\" style=\"width: 690px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10914\" height=\"280\" src=\"https://neglectedbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vf-to-helen-cather-southwick.jpg\" width=\"700\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-10914\">Excerpt from a letter from Virginia Faulkner to Helen Cather Southwick, March 12, 1980.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Virginia&#8217;s time in academic publishing had convinced her that she lacked the education and discipline to undertake a serious study of Cather&#8217;s life and work, but she was convinced that Bernice Slote could and would. And so did many in the community of Cather scholars. Among Bernice&#8217;s papers are letters from people looking forward to her &#8220;authoritative biography,&#8221; and she received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to support her research. But when Virginia died suddenly in September 1980, Bernice &#8212; who had already suffered a major stroke &#8212; found it difficult to muster the energy to take the project forward. Though she resumed teaching for a while, Bernice never again published as an academic, and after a second stroke in late 1982, she was confined to a nursing home, where she died in February 1983.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_10916\" style=\"width: 490px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10916\" height=\"339\" src=\"https://neglectedbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vf-and-bernice.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-10916\">Bernice Slote and Virginia Faulkner in the late 1970s.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the course of researching Virginia Faulkner&#8217;s life, I realized that my task was not, as I thought originally, to write a literary biography. A literary biography &#8212; such as the one Bernice Slote might have written &#8212; tries to illuminate a writer&#8217;s work through the context of their life. In Virginia&#8217;s case, however, her novels and short stories, however funny and well-crafted, were simply not of the caliber to merit close critical study. Though she was often referred to as &#8220;the next Dorothy Parker&#8221; in the 1930s, the fact is that Dorothy Parker was not just a woman with a quick wit and sharp tongue but a writer who produced short stories (in particular) of lasting value, while many of Virginia&#8217;s stories are throwaway accounts of the bickering of idle rich married couples. </p>\n<p>The reason for writing Virginia&#8217;s story was simpler than to illuminate her work: it was to tell her story, the story of a woman of ferocious wit and intelligence who struggled with alcoholism and depression and had the courage to start again at the age of 42, setting aside her own career as a writer and devoting her energy to advancing the work of Willa Cather and the numerous writers she guided as an editor of genius. It was, as that letter to Hazel Barnes shows, a decision she doubted at times, but one she persevered with, to her credit and that of the press and the writers she believed in. I hope that readers will agree that it&#8217;s a story well worth telling.</p>\n<p><em>Virginia Faulkner: A Life in Two Acts</em> is available for pre-orders now from the University of Nebraska Press: <a href=\"https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/bison-books/9781496230621/virginia-faulkner/\">Link</a>.</p>"

When I was an Edmonton teenager, a local video store inexplicably had a copy on VHS, the four-hour version with a soundtrack by Carmine Coppola. I first rented it because I was going through a silent movie phase and was watching every 1920\u2019s era film I could find. I had no particular interest in Napoleon as a figure and didn\u2019t really know what I was in for. But for reasons that are even now difficult to explain, I was bewitched by it, and I rented it over and over until the video store shut down. Over the next decade and a half, the movie was essentially lost to me, even though I never stopped thinking about it. Legal battles prevented its being made widely available on DVD or streaming, and it remains difficult to see in the United States 1 . Its length, which runs to five and a half hours, makes it impractical for movie theaters; screenings are rare and treated as events. Most cinephiles have never seen it. (I\u2019ve written about this movie before , twice actually , but I had fewer subscribers back then. Apologies to longer-term readers for retreading a lot of this ground) A few years ago the British Film Institute made a DVD available for purchase, and I ordered it (along with a player equipped to play discs with British region codes). I watched the first half of it alone, at home, and found my feelings mixed. The set-piece scenes were just as thrilling as I remembered them, but this was a different cut with a different score, not the Napoleon of my teenaged memories. Much of the expanded content was in the Corsica section of the film, which I had always found weaker than the rest. The added scenes weren\u2019t impressive. And I couldn\u2019t imagine trying to share this strange movie with anyone else. But when Film Forum in New York announced they were doing a Napoleon screening as part of a series honoring Kevin Brownlow, I started to get excited. I checked the page every day until the date for Napoleon was announced, and booked a trip to the city for the sole purpose of seeing the movie. And then, sitting in the sold-out audience, I felt nervous and protective. What if they laughed, the way audiences at screenings of old movies often laugh? What if they walked out? And what if I myself didn\u2019t respond to it the way I used to? After all, I hadn\u2019t seen it all the way through in twenty years. I\u2019ve said before that I find something intensely off-putting about the modes and behaviors of fandom , and it felt a bit debasing to be feeling and behaving in such a fannish way about this film. Sitting behind me and my boyfriend at the theater were two young men. One of them announced his intent to leave after the first section and hang out in the park instead. The screening started at 1 pm and was scheduled to finish at 9:30pm, the already lengthy movie extended by two intermissions and a long dinner break. I thought that perhaps half the audience would return after the dinner break, with even fewer remaining until the end. It turned out I didn\u2019t have to worry. \u201cThat was electric ,\u201d enthused one of the young men at the first intermission. \u201cI want to be Napoleon,\u201d said the other. And, even though their enthusiasm vocally dipped after the third act (which takes a break from battlegrounds to depict Napoleon\u2019s courtship of Josephine) they stayed the entire day, along with almost the whole audience. \u201cI feel so transported ,\u201d said a woman in the restroom after the finale. \u201cI have a crush on Napoleon,\u201d her friend replied. And it was a gift to be able to encounter and understand, again, what exactly had obsessed me at age fifteen. Napoleon, a failure when it was released in 1927 and reconstructed with great effort in the second half of the 20th century, has existed in many cuts and versions. The director, Abel Gance, originally intended it to be the first of six films depicting the whole span of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s life (it was his misfortune, perhaps, to be born before the era of prestige TV). As is, we have only the first part, which covers Napoleon\u2019s life only as far as the beginning of his first Italian campaign. The most famous elements of his story \u2014 his sweeping conquests, the coup of 18 Brumaire that launched him to power, his self-crowning as emperor, his humiliation in Russia, his defeat at Waterloo and ultimate exile \u2014 are absent from the movie. The only Napoleon we see is the brilliant young man on the rise. And what a figure he makes! His first cinematic military victory is a snowball fight against his schoolmates. The camera frames the face of the young Napoleon in extreme closeup, cutting repeatedly away and back again in a cinematic effect that is almost strobelike. His gaze is unbroken, and the moment he realizes he is winning, he breaks into a smile that is almost chilling in its intensity and delight. Over the next five hours, he keeps on winning, driven by unshakable self-belief and desire for glory. The camera frames him as near-godlike, often showing him backlit and from low angles. The movie is helped by a charismatic performance by Albert Dieudonn\u00e9, who only needs to make a few different facial expressions but whose gaze almost burns through the screen; the power of that gaze is enough, in the movie, to make rivals retreat, angry mobs fall back, and ragtag soldiers clamor to follow him into battle. I joked to my boyfriend that clearly no one in France had ever encountered a high-agency individual before, since Napoleon bends everyone to his will so easily. We see his great intelligence at work when moving equations, diagrams, and words are close-cut with a closeup of his face (could it be the first usage of this now-cliched technique?). At one point, he becomes a literal fetish object when a young, besotted woman buys a Napoleon figurine from a street vendor, uses it to project his famous silhouette onto a wall, and fantasizes that he is leading her to their marriage bed. The movie is also very strong (if not especially historically authentic) in its scenes depicting the French Revolution, the Terror, and the fall of Robespierre. It\u2019s most successful when it\u2019s operating in fire-and-brimstone mode: revolutionaries weeping upon hearing the Marseillaise for the first time, Robespierre and Danton banging their fists in the convention before frenzied crowds, naked disembodied limbs dancing ecstatically at the victim\u2019s ball (which, given that the women are costumed suspiciously like flappers, is perhaps my favorite \u201cGatsby Party\u201d scene in cinema). I\u2019ll also call out the scene depicting Charlotte Corday\u2019s assassination of Marat for special mention. The final sequence, where the Great Man stands atop a mountain and promises glory to his army, is remembered primarily for its technical innovation. In the pre-widescreen days, Gance attempted a widescreen effect by projecting three synchronized images side-by-side, shot by three cameras and ideally projected onto a triple-width screen. Sometimes the three panels show a single wide image, but sometimes they show a triptych. While the music soars, the screen floods the senses, quickly cutting between visions of marching troops and other symbols: an open flame, a flying eagle, a turning globe, and (of course) the flashing gaze of Napoleon. It has an energizing, transporting, brain-scrambling effect. If the movie does its job, which it certainly seemed to do last Sunday, the audience exits the theater feeling ready to follow Napoleon into battle. A sequence from one of the panels in the final triptych. If all of this sounds a little fascistic, you\u2019re not wrong! There is nothing at all subtle about Gance\u2019s treatment of the Great Man, and its effect veers uncomfortably close to propaganda. Watching this movie, feeling swept away by a man and a cause two centuries in the past, I understand why so many intellectuals through history have been suspicious of music and the arts. The creation of a rapturous aesthetic effect, a euphoria, suppresses all ambiguity and short-circuits the rational part of the brain, allowing ideas to be smuggled in that would not stand on their own merits (for example, that invading Italy could be a fun and cool thing to do). Anita Brookner wrote about this movie best : But if Josephine slightly lets the side down (as the poor woman did, to her cost), the ravishing images more than compensate. There is the cat peering from the mouth of a cannon; there is the hand crushed by the wheel of a gun-carriage; there is a giant Tricolour unfurling; there is a slowly collapsing staircase; there is the unmoving face of Charlotte Corday (beautiful Marguerite Gance) and her hand sheathing the knife in her bodice; there is Marat\u2019s shoulder with a scab on it, and the underside of his dead jaw. And there are, above all, the great set-pieces, like the grotesque and vulnerable faces of the crowd at the National Convention, or the sea like a lake of silver before it tilts into waves that fill the screen from top to bottom; there is the Army of Italy, composed of scores of ragged men, threatening to march into the auditorium. There is Napoleon, gaunt, on his horse in the far distance, looking like Daumier\u2019s Don Quixote. There is Robespierre in the Maison Duplay, his terrors soothed by a young man playing a hurdy-gurdy. There is the giant with the words Mort aux Tyrans painted on his chest; he guards the door to the National Convention and signifies the end of the old order, yet he bows to Camille Desmoulins. Above all, there is energy, extravagance, ambition, orgiastic pleasure, high drama and the desire for endless victory: not only Napoleon\u2019s destiny but everyone\u2019s most central hope. One sees why this film appealed to de Gaulle, especially when Napoleon outlines to Marat his vision of a federation of European states led by France. At this point, there floated into the vault of the cinema a subliminal feeling that he ought to have been allowed to carry this through. During the screening of Napoleon I told my boyfriend: I love this movie so much that it\u2019s almost overwhelming . It\u2019s a little strange that I would come to feel that way about it, given that (true to gender stereotypes) I usually find war movies very boring and tend to prefer love stories. Perhaps the triumph of Napoleon is that Gance is so in love with his subject that he turns a war story into a love story. In one scene, the ghosts of Danton, Robespierre, Marat, and Saint Just appear to Napoleon and warn him that he will be punished if he betrays the ideals of the French Revolution. Aside from this, we have no hint of how Gance would have portrayed the twilight of his idol, his mistakes, his egregious vanity-driven excesses, his humiliation and ultimate failure. I am pretty uncomfortable with the idea of anyone on the tech right watching this movie, tempted to see themselves in it. All forms of Great Man worship are questionable, but furthermore, these men are no Napoleons. Only a few days after Napoleon , my boyfriend and I attended another five-hour entertainment: Richard Wagner\u2019s opera Parsifal at the San Francisco opera (more on that in another email). Recently I\u2019ve been reading Alex Ross\u2019s Wagnerism , his examination of the far-reaching effects of the works of Wagner on the thinkers of his contemporaries and successors, and it\u2019s an illuminating but occasionally frustrating experience. Trying to grapple seriously with Wagner\u2019s thinking is a losing game. No one would have taken his thinking seriously if he hadn\u2019t written that music , if he hadn\u2019t been able to create euphoric states in his audience. And though I am less educated in the works of Nietzsche \u2014 who worked in close relation to Wagner and was fascinated with the idea of a Great Man \u2014 sometimes I get the impression that he prioritized the creation of these euphoric moments in his prose over the task of clearly articulating his ideology. Napoleon etched itself deeply into my teenage brain through similar channels and inspired my interest in French literature and especially in all the ambiguities and contradictions of the French Revolution. Would a more reasonable movie have done the same? Ridley Scott\u2019s attempt to make a not-worshipful Napoleon movie was dreadful, and it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll get another anytime soon. It\u2019s a shame that Gance wasn\u2019t able to follow Napoleon\u2019s tragic arc to its completion. But perhaps it\u2019s just too hard to compete with one of humanity\u2019s most beloved narratives: the extraordinary man who wins and wins and wins again. I promise not to write about this movie a fourth time. Consider subscribing: 1 The Internet Archive has a version available to watch online , although it\u2019s a subpar viewing experience.

When I was an Edmonton teenager, a local video store inexplicably had a copy on VHS, the four-hour version with a soundtrack by Carmine Coppola. I first rented it because I was going through a silent movie phase and was watching every 1920&#8217;s era film I could find. I had no particular interest in Napoleon as a figure and didn&#8217;t really know what I was in for. But for reasons that are even now difficult to explain, I was bewitched by it, and I rented it over and over until the video store shut down. Over the next decade and a half, the movie was essentially lost to me, even though I never stopped thinking about it. Legal battles prevented its being made widely available on DVD or streaming, and it remains difficult to see in the United States<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a>. Its length, which runs to five and a half hours, makes it impractical for movie theaters; screenings are rare and treated as events. Most cinephiles have never seen it.</p><p>(I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://cecilycarver.substack.com/p/napoleon-vu-par-abel-gance\">written about this movie before</a>, <a href=\"https://cecilycarver.substack.com/p/two-other-movies-about-napoleon\">twice actually</a>, but I had fewer subscribers back then. Apologies to longer-term readers for retreading a lot of this ground)</p><p>A few years ago the British Film Institute made a DVD available for purchase, and I ordered it (along with a player equipped to play discs with British region codes). I watched the first half of it alone, at home, and found my feelings mixed. The set-piece scenes were just as thrilling as I remembered them, but this was a different cut with a different score, not the <em>Napoleon</em> of my teenaged memories. Much of the expanded content was in the Corsica section of the film, which I had always found weaker than the rest. The added scenes weren&#8217;t impressive. And I couldn&#8217;t imagine trying to share this strange movie with anyone else.</p><p>But when Film Forum in New York announced they were doing a <em>Napoleon</em> screening as part of a series honoring Kevin Brownlow, I started to get excited. I checked the page every day until the date for <em>Napoleon</em> was announced, and booked a trip to the city for the sole purpose of seeing the movie. And then, sitting in the sold-out audience, I felt nervous and protective. What if they laughed, the way audiences at screenings of old movies often laugh? What if they walked out? And what if I myself didn&#8217;t respond to it the way I used to? After all, I hadn&#8217;t seen it all the way through in twenty years. I&#8217;ve said before that I <a href=\"https://cecilycarver.substack.com/p/notes-on-my-reading-habits\">find something intensely off-putting about the modes and behaviors of fandom</a>, and it felt a bit debasing to be feeling and behaving in such a fannish way about this film. </p><p>Sitting behind me and my boyfriend at the theater were two young men. One of them announced his intent to leave after the first section and hang out in the park instead. The screening started at 1 pm and was scheduled to finish at 9:30pm, the already lengthy movie extended by two intermissions and a long dinner break. I thought that perhaps half the audience would return after the dinner break, with even fewer remaining until the end.</p><p>It turned out I didn&#8217;t have to worry. &#8220;That was <em>electric</em>,&#8221; enthused one of the young men at the first intermission. &#8220;I want to <em>be</em> Napoleon,&#8221; said the other. And, even though their enthusiasm vocally dipped after the third act (which takes a break from battlegrounds to depict Napoleon&#8217;s courtship of Josephine) they stayed the entire day, along with almost the whole audience. &#8220;I feel so <em>transported</em>,&#8221; said a woman in the restroom after the finale. &#8220;I have a crush on Napoleon,&#8221; her friend replied. And it was a gift to be able to encounter and understand, again, what exactly had obsessed me at age fifteen.</p><p>Napoleon, a failure when it was released in 1927 and reconstructed with great effort in the second half of the 20th century, has existed in many cuts and versions. The director, Abel Gance, originally intended it to be the first of six films depicting the whole span of Napoleon Bonaparte&#8217;s life (it was his misfortune, perhaps, to be born before the era of prestige TV). As is, we have only the first part, which covers Napoleon&#8217;s life only as far as the beginning of his first Italian campaign. The most famous elements of his story &#8212; his sweeping conquests, the coup of 18 Brumaire that launched him to power, his self-crowning as emperor, his humiliation in Russia, his defeat at Waterloo and ultimate exile &#8212; are absent from the movie. The only Napoleon we see is the brilliant young man on the rise.</p><p>And what a figure he makes! His first cinematic military victory is a snowball fight against his schoolmates. The camera frames the face of the young Napoleon in extreme closeup, cutting repeatedly away and back again in a cinematic effect that is almost strobelike. His gaze is unbroken, and the moment he realizes he is winning, he breaks into a smile that is almost chilling in its intensity and delight. Over the next five hours, he keeps on winning, driven by unshakable self-belief and desire for glory. The camera frames him as near-godlike, often showing him backlit and from low angles. The movie is helped by a charismatic performance by Albert Dieudonn&#233;, who only needs to make a few different facial expressions but whose gaze almost burns through the screen; the power of that gaze is enough, in the movie, to make rivals retreat, angry mobs fall back, and ragtag soldiers clamor to follow him into battle. I joked to my boyfriend that clearly no one in France had ever encountered a high-agency individual before, since Napoleon bends everyone to his will so easily. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X6A8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f706716-8a4c-405d-bc70-a84e8e0399a2_320x240.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Animated gif depicting a scene between Napoleon and his mother.

At one point, he becomes a literal fetish object when a young, besotted woman buys a Napoleon figurine from a street vendor, uses it to project his famous silhouette onto a wall, and fantasizes that he is leading her to their marriage bed.</p><p>The movie is also very strong (if not especially historically authentic) in its scenes depicting the French Revolution, the Terror, and the fall of Robespierre. It&#8217;s most successful when it&#8217;s operating in fire-and-brimstone mode: revolutionaries weeping upon hearing the Marseillaise for the first time, Robespierre and Danton banging their fists in the convention before frenzied crowds, naked disembodied limbs dancing ecstatically at the victim&#8217;s ball (which, given that the women are costumed suspiciously like flappers, is perhaps my favorite &#8220;Gatsby Party&#8221; scene in cinema). I&#8217;ll also call out the scene depicting Charlotte Corday&#8217;s assassination of Marat for special mention.</p><p>The final sequence, where the Great Man stands atop a mountain and promises glory to his army, is remembered primarily for its technical innovation. In the pre-widescreen days, Gance attempted a widescreen effect by projecting three synchronized images side-by-side, shot by three cameras and ideally projected onto a triple-width screen. Sometimes the three panels show a single wide image, but sometimes they show a triptych. While the music soars, the screen floods the senses, quickly cutting between visions of marching troops and other symbols: an open flame, a flying eagle, a turning globe, and (of course) the flashing gaze of Napoleon. It has an energizing, transporting, brain-scrambling effect. If the movie does its job, which it certainly seemed to do last Sunday, the audience exits the theater feeling ready to follow Napoleon into battle.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Aehv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0fb0348-f7c4-47e5-9a5d-59174fc29bb1_320x240.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Cinematic images of Napoleon, a globe, a map, a flame, an eagle (among other things) shown in quick succession.\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Aehv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0fb0348-f7c4-47e5-9a5d-59174fc29bb1_320x240.gif\" title=\"Cinematic images of Napoleon, a globe, a map, a flame, an eagle (among other things) shown in quick succession.\" width=\"320\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">A sequence from one of the panels in the final triptych.</figcaption></figure></div><p>If all of this sounds a little fascistic, you&#8217;re not wrong! There is nothing at all subtle about Gance&#8217;s treatment of the Great Man, and its effect veers uncomfortably close to propaganda. Watching this movie, feeling swept away by a man and a cause two centuries in the past, I understand why so many intellectuals through history have been suspicious of music and the arts. The creation of a rapturous aesthetic effect, a euphoria, suppresses all ambiguity and short-circuits the rational part of the brain, allowing ideas to be smuggled in that would not stand on their own merits (for example, that invading Italy could be a fun and cool thing to do). </p><p>Anita Brookner <a href=\"https://cecilycarver.substack.com/p/two-other-movies-about-napoleon#:~:text=In%20her%20review%2C%20she%20correctly%20points%20out%20its%20flaws\">wrote about this movie best</a>: </p><blockquote><p>But if Josephine slightly lets the side down (as the poor woman did, to her cost), the ravishing images more than compensate. There is the cat peering from the mouth of a cannon; there is the hand crushed by the wheel of a gun-carriage; there is a giant Tricolour unfurling; there is a slowly collapsing staircase; there is the unmoving face of Charlotte Corday (beautiful Marguerite Gance) and her hand sheathing the knife in her bodice; there is Marat&#8217;s shoulder with a scab on it, and the underside of his dead jaw. And there are, above all, the great set-pieces, like the grotesque and vulnerable faces of the crowd at the National Convention, or the sea like a lake of silver before it tilts into waves that fill the screen from top to bottom; there is the Army of Italy, composed of scores of ragged men, threatening to march into the auditorium. There is Napoleon, gaunt, on his horse in the far distance, looking like Daumier&#8217;s Don Quixote. There is Robespierre in the Maison Duplay, his terrors soothed by a young man playing a hurdy-gurdy. There is the giant with the words <em>Mort aux Tyrans</em> painted on his chest; he guards the door to the National Convention and signifies the end of the old order, yet he bows to Camille Desmoulins.</p><p>Above all, there is energy, extravagance, ambition, orgiastic pleasure, high drama and the desire for endless victory: not only Napoleon&#8217;s destiny but everyone&#8217;s most central hope. One sees why this film appealed to de Gaulle, especially when Napoleon outlines to Marat his vision of a federation of European states led by France. At this point, there floated into the vault of the cinema a subliminal feeling that he ought to have been allowed to carry this through.</p></blockquote><p>During the screening of <em>Napoleon</em> I told my boyfriend: <em>I love this movie so much that it&#8217;s almost overwhelming</em>. It&#8217;s a little strange that I would come to feel that way about it, given that (true to gender stereotypes) I usually find war movies very boring and tend to prefer love stories. Perhaps the triumph of <em>Napoleon</em> is that Gance is so in love with his subject that he turns a war story into a love story. In one scene, the ghosts of Danton, Robespierre, Marat, and Saint Just appear to Napoleon and warn him that he will be punished if he betrays the ideals of the French Revolution. Aside from this, we have no hint of how Gance would have portrayed the twilight of his idol, his mistakes, his egregious vanity-driven excesses, his humiliation and ultimate failure. I am pretty uncomfortable with the idea of anyone on the tech right watching this movie, tempted to see themselves in it. All forms of Great Man worship are questionable, but furthermore, these men are no Napoleons.</p><p>Only a few days after <em>Napoleon</em>, my boyfriend and I attended another five-hour entertainment: Richard Wagner&#8217;s opera <em>Parsifal</em> at the San Francisco opera (more on that in another email). Recently I&#8217;ve been reading Alex Ross&#8217;s <em>Wagnerism</em>, his examination of the far-reaching effects of the works of Wagner on the thinkers of his contemporaries and successors, and it&#8217;s an illuminating but occasionally frustrating experience. Trying to grapple seriously with Wagner&#8217;s <em>thinking</em> is a losing game. No one would have taken his thinking seriously if he hadn&#8217;t written <em>that music</em>, if he hadn&#8217;t been able to create euphoric states in his audience. And though I am less educated in the works of Nietzsche &#8212; who worked in close relation to Wagner and was fascinated with the idea of a Great Man &#8212; sometimes I get the impression that he prioritized the creation of these euphoric moments in his prose over the task of clearly articulating his ideology. <em>Napoleon</em> etched itself deeply into my teenage brain through similar channels and inspired my interest in French literature and especially in all the ambiguities and contradictions of the French Revolution.

It\u2019s been tried before, she relates, but the results so far have not been promising. Says Chanda Prescod-Weinstein: Through the recognition of white empiricism, a bifurcated logic that serves white supremacist traditions in science while deontologizing marginalized Black women physicists, I propose that the Black feminist theory intersectionality should change physics\u2014and not just through who becomes a physicist but through the actual outcomes of what we come to know. Now you might see this is as yet another example genuine academic gibberish. And this was only a short passage with seemingly some 70,000 more words just like it. But I read it and found gold. Her gist seems to be that whites have been so successful in physics\u2014discovering almost all things, deriving the most profound insights, producing a wealth of knowledge, and, though its cliche, changing the world\u2014that she was forced to invent the term White empiricism to describe these seemingly endless triumphs. Having been told I\u2019m White myself, and recalling my my own meager share to the stockpile of discovery, I thank her for this. Mighty White of her, as we used to say. Chanda Prescod-Weinstein says \u201cWhite empiricism is one of the mechanisms by which this [ prestige ] asymmetry follows Black women physicists into their professional lives.\u201d Those are her italics, by the way. She really knows how to make a guy blush. I mean, I knew Whites were good, which is why you see so many of them in physics and other fields of intellectual endeavor, all of which are top heavy with White men, to say the least. But flattery like \u201c prestige \u201d is a little embarrassing. She meant well, I\u2019m sure, but a simple \u201cThank you\u201d would have been sufficient. Subscribe now I\u2019m not sure what she knows about black women, but it must be that she thought they wouldn\u2019t have been able to do physics as well as the White guys until they learned to think like them. She\u2019sblunt in her assessment: \u201c[W]hite supremacy in physics produces [b]lack physicists as a permanent ontological Other.\u201d Harsh and seemingly with a finality that will be difficult for some to accept. Her outlook is somewhat bleak: The experiences of [b]lack scientists in professional physics can be described by frameworks developed in the field of social epistemology: epistemic injustice, epistemic oppression, and conceptual competence injustice. Now I know black women haven\u2019t contributed much to physics, but to call their efforts \u201cepistemic injustice\u201d is brutal. Calling out Nature creating \u201cconceptual competence injustice\u201d will smack of \u201cracism\u201d to many. But that, I insist, is the wrong notion. People cannot be faulted for lacking intellectual ability. It is no sin, so to speak, to be born short. You are or aren\u2019t tall and have to deal with what you have. It follows there is no point crowing about being naturally tall, intellectually speaking. At best it is boorish. Feminists do not escape her penetrating criticims. Look, if you dare, what Chanda Prescod-Weinstein says about feminists: [A]lthough there has been some scholarship on feminist theory and physics, it seems the primary feminist epistemology axiom has been that physics is unusual because the laws that underlie it are universal and not determined by people. We can dispute what we mean by \u201c laws \u201c, but the sentiment is exactly right. Physics aims to find how Nature works, while not depending on the vicissitudes of culture. It takes a brave woman to criticize one of her own, and Chanda Prescod-Weinstein will surely catch Hell from feminists about this. But she is right to point out feminists are crazy. We owe her our support. The good news is that, even if our own optimism flags, Chanda Prescod-Weinstein retains hers cheerfulness about black women. Go back and read her title again. It is no accident she began with \u201cMaking\u201d. She knows that if black woman can be made to think like White men, embrace their epistemological attitudes as it were, we might somebody be able to say not \u201cWhite supremacy\u201d in physics, but \u201cWhite & black supremacy\u201d. She says all that because \u201cGeneral Relativity implies that there is no hierarchy of observers\u201d thus\u2014and this really is her inference\u2014\u201cStandpoint theory correctly identifies that there are contexts in which [b]lack women are epistemically privileged observers\u201d.

In this conversation, I talk with Jacob Trefethen, who oversees science funding at Open Philanthropy, allocating about $100m/year. The discussion reveals how philanthropy makes decisions about which scientific research to fund, with Open Philanthropy's unique \"hits-based giving\" approach aiming for asymmetric upside. Jacob shares insights on neglected research areas like Strep A (which causes half a million deaths annually yet receives minimal funding), the limitations of AI in accelerating scientific progress, and the challenges of balancing trade-offs when deciding between funding immediate applications versus more speculative basic research. The interview offers a window into how Open Philanthropy allocates resources to potentially transformative science, from funding researchers rejected by traditional systems to debating whether certain scientific approaches deserve long-term, substantial funding. Throughout, Jacob provides a thoughtful perspective on what effective science funding looks like and how scientific institutions might evolve. Topics discussed: On Open Philanthropy\u2019s decision process Is it possible to make expected value calculations for basic scientific research? Non-profit funding vs for-profit funding Why the NIH rejects grants Jacob\u2019s \u201cPhD\u201d working side-by-side with two biochemists for 5 years Today\u2019s system of federal funding are not supporting generalists How will AI affect the pace of scientific progress? AI Baumol Disease Can AI speed up aging research? The wisest people Jacob & Alexey know The future of science in academia How Open Philanthropy uses neglectedness to make funding trade-offs Jacob\u2019s advice and views on purpose Jacob\u2019s favorite joke Introduction ALEXEY GUZEY: Good to see you, Jacob. JACOB TREFETHEN: Good to see you, Alexey. TREFETHEN: How have you been? GUZEY: I've been good, good. Traveling around. Good to visit San Francisco, as always. TREFETHEN: How long are you here for? GUZEY: For a few days, I think. Flying to the East Coast afterwards. One of the main reasons I'm here is, in fact, to talk to you. TREFETHEN: I'm honored. Well, thank you for coming by. Thanks for coming to make it easy for me. On Open Philanthropy's decision process GUZEY: You run science funding at Open Philanthropy. You spend a lot of time thinking about global health R&D and more basic science. TREFETHEN: And we have a process where program officers and I have to agree at least 50% of the time. So, in fact, we end up agreeing quite a bit more. Probably more like 75, 80% of the time, currently. GUZEY: That's kind of a brilliant way to structure this, actually. TREFETHEN: That's\u2013 yeah. I think it might get the best of both worlds, because we are trying to take bets with these grants that have asymmetric upside, hopefully. Hits-based giving is a framing that we'll often use. We care about the 5, 10% percent of grants that are really, really epic at the end of the day. And it's totally fine if the rest of the grants that we fund don't end up leading so much. So within science, especially, where you can't really predict the future very well, that model, I think, is going to outperform from a social impact point of view something that is more structured. We have a highly autonomous system. You could argue that it's always about the margins of how far you go. NIH or NSF or Wellcome Trust \u2013 or pick your other funder \u2013 will often have peer review that does maybe give you more signal. We steal the program manager-type role from offers a little bit \u2013 of you have one person who has a budget and they have a lot of autonomy within it \u2013 to get the benefits of \"you can't get vetoed\". POs [Program Officers] cannot veto each other's grants with certain very limited asterisks. And that's wonderful because you don't have to persuade people. GUZEY: Yeah. TREFETHEN: You know, of course, PO performance gets assessed over time. So, at a yearly level, you can't disagree more than 50%, and then at a longer term level, if you're making lots of grants that look way above the bar set by global health charities, then Open Philanthropy should allocate more money to that program. It's a slightly more complicated long run system than I'm painting. But anyway, we think it gets the best of both worlds. Overall, my opinion is that science funding does involve too much\u2026 a little bit too much peer review, probably. And we're in one direction of like really little peer review. Program officers can decide \"I would like to get external peer review\" on something. And they often do because they cannot be experts in everything they fund. GUZEY: This is interesting to me because I've been thinking about this a lot. And I also had experience like running a science organization, funding science projects, right? And I used to talk about how terrible peer review is beforehand. And then in retrospect, the first thing that I ended up instituting was peer review because I was so scared of making decisions. And it's like, well, I'm not a specialist, and then I had always tried to make sure that everyone agrees on what we're doing. In retrospect, something like 50% is a great idea. I also immediately start to think about like, okay, what would be the dynamics of the system where, like so you say we have a program officer and they don't have to commission peer review, but they can, and they want to, and \u2013 I'm like, okay, if you just have the system, then over time, probably what's going to happen is that it's going to tend towards like commissioning peer review becoming the norm. And then not asking for peer review will be kind of weird, even if technically you're not like you don't need to. And just because like, again, people are pressured to minimize risks. And then you can always blame others if you commission peer review versus not. But they also like, again, this gets me back to this 50% benchmark. If you notice that you have like 80%, 90% agreement, then this is a signal to you that maybe you're doing too much peer review, which is like a signal that would be absent if you didn't have this benchmark for how much we should be agreeing. TREFETHEN: That's interesting, because that's actually not the implication that I take. GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: I think I would correlate my opinion more with program officers at Open Philanthropy than peer review scores from external experts, would be my guess. Which means that the implication... the implication would not be right. Another downside of having such an autonomous system with \u2013 at the moment, the only real checkers being me, and in some cases, Emily Olsen and Alexander Berger at Open Philanthropy \u2013 is that you end up fitting too much to \"am I [points at self] going to give the stamp of 'I agree' or not?\" So you should do less peer review, you should spend more time with Jacob. So I worry about that . I don't worry about the peer review one. We also hire people who are quite\u2026 who are not shrinking violets . We're hiring people who want to change the world . They're going out there and they believe in stuff. Are there other dynamic parts of the system you think could go wrong and how I've described it, though? GUZEY: People trying to please their boss is always a huge issue. But yeah, there is probably not that much you can do. Is it possible to make expected value calculations for basic scientific research? I think for me, like, my immediate thought here is it seems really hard, if not impossible, to do any kind of expected value calculations if you're funding science. And so you mentioned that \u2013 I think I'm just really confused about how this actually works. TREFETHEN: Yeah. GUZEY: Because like, I myself don't trust the calculations for things like deworming or like malaria nets , even. They seem like... Very, very fishy to me. But then if we're thinking science and basic science and \u2014 TREFETHEN: It's interesting you chose those two examples, where people have looked at them more. I wonder if that's an availability reason you chose those two. GUZEY: I mean, I saw the tables that GiveWell was providing for deworming impact estimates. And there is like, a hundred effects. And then, these are only short-term effects. And then, like, for malaria as well. TREFETHEN: Deworming looks at long-term, but yeah, I agree with the point you're making. I'm just wondering if there's, the point you're making is downstream of it being very difficult to know anything about the world. GUZEY: I mean, yeah, yeah, basically it is, but the point I'm making is that even for things that seem much simpler than assessing expected value of basic science, I'm still pretty skeptical about them. TREFETHEN: Got it, got it. I'm with you. GUZEY: And then we get to basic science, and to me, it's like, well, I mean, this has got to be impossible to do here. And yet somehow\u2026 TREFETHEN: Yeah. GUZEY: Like, how does that work? TREFETHEN: So, it gets way easier the closer things get to application to put rough quantifications on them. So, we're funding an efficacy trial of \u2013 we were just talking about TB vaccines. We're funding an efficacy trial of a TB vaccine in adults, and we can really constrain a bit better the probabilities of \"do we think that it will detect efficacy in a given range, given the design of the study, given previous trials in TB?\". We have a little bit of a base rate to go off of. If so, do we think that it would become a GAVI vaccine ? So, it would be GAVI-supported in lower-income countries? Do we think the Indian government would\u2014 GUZEY: But this is also, like, very applied, like, so... TREFETHEN: Totally, I'm going to look around. GUZEY: One of your grantees just got Nobel , right, in Chemistry: David Baker . And you were very proud of starting to fund him back in his lab, back in 2017. TREFETHEN: Not me personally, my colleagues. GUZEY: Your esteemed scientists \u2013 biochemists \u2013 Chris Somerville and Heather Youngs , who I'm going to ask you about afterwards as well. TREFETHEN: Oh, okay. GUZEY: Also, sorry if I'm pushing too much on this, but, like, is there an Excel table somewhere in the annals of Open Philanthropy where Chris and Heather, like, calculated the expected value of giving a grant to David Baker and it came out to be larger than distributing malaria nets in Africa? Or was it just \u2013 he seems like a really brilliant person working on something very exciting, we should support him? TREFETHEN: We almost always... So, nowadays, well, I'm trying to figure out the way to answer this. We almost always will have a spreadsheet of some form. GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: Now, what weight we put on that spreadsheet, versus qualitative factors of other forms? GUZEY: Yeah, because I remember, Holden has this blog post that I keep returning to a lot where he talks about the expected value calculations and their weight in decision-making of when you're doing hits-based giving, right? And the inherent limitations in any kind of expected value calculations. TREFETHEN: The calculations are always an input. They're always a tool that we try and use. The benefits they hold... If you can make a believable one, is that you can try and set consistently budgets across cause areas that are very different. So, for example, Open Philanthropy does not do all basic science. You know, we could give all the money away to basic science, but nowhere near that. GUZEY: Yeah. TREFETHEN: And to do that, we would have to be persuaded of some quantitative reason to do it. I think it's actually quite hard to make the case that Open Philanthropy should do... I think we might do about 700 million of grant making this year. We should do 700 million in basic science, given the cases you can make for the, you know, global aid policy program we have. The cases you can make for lead reduction that's nothing to do with vaccines. You know, the cases you can make for factory farming is something that is a sort of current really messed up part of our society that you need to get rid of. So, you need some way to do a comparison between causes. The more quantitative you can make it, in my opinion, is great if the numbers reflect anything in reality. I think the further that you go back towards basic science with no intended application, the harder that gets. You can rely on some things, though. You know, like, we exist within a context. And that context includes the existence of the NIH. That context includes the existence of HHMI . That context includes... The existence of, you know, the Allen Institute . So, it's not like that if Open Philanthropy doesn't exist, basic science won't exist. We're playing at a margin. And we can try and look at what are other actors doing and can we get any sense of how valuable that is in comparison. And I think you can make educated guesses about what a good basic science grant looks like from working backwards from potential applications. And this is a... You know, you've got to be careful. Because you never know what the true theory of change will end up being. But I think it's usually productive to have a theory of change. And, you know, if you look at \u2014 GUZEY: Right. Like, what you're saying is that you don't know how exactly the thing you're funding will end up being useful. But if you literally can't think of a way that it will be useful, then this fact is informative compared to whether you thought there's five different ways something might be useful. TREFETHEN: Yep, absolutely. And, you know, the reason we wouldn't fund something that's really stand out, that might be cross-cutting, is sometimes simply located in, well, would this get funded by the NIH? And, you know, you mentioned David Baker and Institute of Protein Design . They had... They... We are not the cause of David Baker being David Baker. You know, David Baker's been supported by\u2013 He's a rock star being supported by many people, by many funders, I mean. The grant that we made at that time came from... So this is maybe apocryphal, because I was not in the room. I'm going off of secondhand. But, you know, Chris and Heather seeing Baker present these ideas, assuming, since it's so cool, that he would get funded by conventional federal actors, coming back around later, he still haven't got the money. And it's like, what the heck? And engaging in more detail of, okay, what would it look like if we made a pretty large grant to the Institute for Protein Design? And I believe in that case, again, you should ask David Baker and Neil King as well \u2013 get them on the show \u2013 but my colleagues, Chris and Heather, were pitched a certain thing and said, \"that's a great thing.\" It was to do with flu vaccines and vaccinology, and sort of applying frontier techniques of protein design to that. But then asked, \"okay, wonderful, David, by the way, like, what do you really want to do? That think you can't get funded?\" And I believe David Baker was then like, \"well, actually, really, I want to do this methods development. So that I can sort of work on protein design at a fundamental \u2013\" So deep learning wasn't quite the paradigm back then, probably. But, you know, various machine learning techniques to work on protein design. But, you know, he was \u2013 He didn't fit the box of \u2013 His background did not fit the box of NIH would give him $10 million or whatever. that... And then Chris and Heather were like, amazing, do both. Like, here's $6 million for that, $6 million for this. And, you know, that's not something that we do with every grantee, for sure. That's not our... But it's something that philanthropy can do. And the reason that looks so good, even quantitatively, relates to the fact that... That he couldn't get funded elsewhere. And I get more nervous when we're just like, okay, look at this really hot shot person, give them loads of money, \u2013 this doesn't always counterfactually look that hot to me. Because the hot shot person often has access to lots of money. So you got to have a more specific story about, their background doesn't quite match what they want to do. Or, you know, their funders have not come to... GUZEY: If someone wants to get science funding from Open Philanthropy, it's easy for me to go and try to get funding from a bunch of other different places and get turned down by all of them. TREFETHEN: I mean \u2013 GUZEY: Because otherwise Open Philanthropy will ask you, \"well, why are you coming to us?\" Non-profit funding vs for-profit funding TREFETHEN: It's kind of a horrible aspect of nonprofit funding, that\u2013 GUZEY: Yeah. TREFETHEN: That it's the exact opposite of if you start a startup and you try and raise money. If anyone hears on the grapevine, if you're a VC and you hear \"they're about to get funded,\" you're racing to try and get your money in. GUZEY: [laughing] Yeah. TREFETHEN: Because you're like, \"oh my God, there's no financing risk. Incredible.\" Whereas nonprofit dollars are so scarce, and when you care about counterfactuals, you can't\u2014 We don't care if our name is on something. We care about the impact. So it's a huge win. If someone else can fund something, it gives us more firepower to fund the next great thing we want to. But it is way worse from a PI 's point of view and from an executive of a nonprofit's point of view. It's pretty... It's really... The dynamics are kind of messed up in that way. Why the NIH rejects grants My colleague, Matt Clancy, who works on innovation policy, sort of made a grant and set up a collaboration with the UK government on meta-science grants, which they're now evaluating right now. And I think you can get benefits of having one pipeline, but multiple funders with different perspectives. And sure enough, with the NIH program, there's just a lot of stuff that... I mean, there are many familiar reasons why NIH grants get rejected that you or I or another funder might not agree with. And some of them are that a given scientist doesn't have enough experience in a given area. That's like a classic reason to get rejected. And I don't think that's a great reason in lots of cases. Another is that there's not initial data that shows that what they're trying to do will probably work, and it's basically too ambitious and too risky. Very common. And not the kind of thing that we would rule out a grant for. And in fact, some of our best grants look like that. So if you can use existing grant pipelines and look at the work that people have put in to write those proposals, I think that can be a great thing to do. It can't get you all of the best grants. Because sometimes you have to... You know, scientists often are trained by the system to break up problems into NIH-fundable units. And if you talk to a professor and say, you actually don't have to work within that... And you really try and think together through, like, \"what could it look like if you worked on this?\" You can end up with quite a different grant proposal. So it's not a be-all, end-all. Just use the existing pipelines. But it's a pretty good start. And there's stuff... You know, if I was a new science funder sort of trying to get my feet wet, I think it's a great way to start. Because you see, well, before I try and revolutionize the system, what is the system currently doing? I need to sort of know that before I actually know what I'm doing. So you can get a more grounded sense of your disagreements with the system by doing it. Jacob's \"PhD\" working side-by-side with two biochemists for 5 years GUZEY: So what did you learn from Chris and Heather ? TREFETHEN: I mean, it's... I don't know how to condense that into an answer. Because we've worked together for the length of a PhD for me. So I've had, you know, weekly meetings with them\u2014 GUZEY: But I guess there is maybe a little bit more context to make it somewhat easier. This person, like, doesn't have a science background, right, and they are scientists with long careers in biochemistry. You ended up, through the years, you went from not really knowing anything about scientific grant-making and not having a background in science to overseeing a big science portfolio. I wonder if there are some key mental things that you learned. Or is it... Or is it less that, and more you just spent years reading grant applications and talking to them? That is just the accumulation of all of this is what enables you to do your work now? Or... TREFETHEN: The accumulation of talking to Chris and Heather for many years, it does enable me to do my work now. That's also true outside of some scientific perspective and talking to other people at Open Philanthropy, which is a kind of hub for thinking about effective philanthropy. So I don't want to short shrift other people, too. But about scientific grant making, yes. I mean, we've just gone over a hundred plus grants that have been made I know really well. And that's... I haven't made them. And I haven't been qualified to make most of those. But I've discussed them. I've tried to come up with objections to why we shouldn't do this. Try and do that all the time to be generative or to... Some... Occasionally it will be a useful input into changing direction of something or expanding a budget. I think the sort of high-level things\u2014 I'm just reflecting now on what high-level things I've learned from Chris and Heather. I mean, one thing that's really... They have such a unique relationship with each other. And they disagree a lot. And that is very valuable to watch as someone coming from the outside, that you can have quite different perspectives, even with very similar shared information state. And that cuts against the sort of spreadsheet approach to things. You really can be right there in the trenches with each other and still disagree. Now, I don't want to overstate that because we've tried to quantify the disagreement, of course. And so we've done exercises like, even if you can't say how good an expected value something would be, give an ordinal ranking of your grants. So in a given year, put your grants into buckets. Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4, Tier 5. And we've done exercises where I've done that for science grants. Chris has done that for science grants. Heather's done that for science grants. Katherine 's done that for science grants. Ray 's done that for science grants. And... Sorry, for their own grants in those cases. I'm going to recall the numbers wrong. But the ranking between Chris and Heather is more correlated. It's fairly correlated. It's not random. They kind of agree at the end of the day on quite a lot. The standard deviation of tier is something like 0.6. I have to look back. I disagree a bit more, interestingly. But overall, don't disagree that much. And, you know, what is that sample? Well, that sample excludes anything that we didn't make a grant to. So there might be more disagreement located in the things that never get a tier. That's very possible. But, yeah, it's great to see... I've seen a deliberative, reflective process play out every week in an hour and a half or hour-long meeting with agreement and convergence and diversion. That's probably been... I mean, that's been very fun, for one thing. And we \u2013 I mean, Chris and Heather, but other colleagues too \u2013 cover such a broad area. That's another really interesting part of what you can do as a philanthropist. I mean, you could as other financing entities. You could as a VC as well. But, you know, their background is not in biomedicine. They're biochemists. But that background means that they have a kind of generalism across lots of forms of basic research that would end up being relevant to vaccines, drug diagnostics, you know, vector control tools. But also, you know, medical papers, also structural biology, also this, that. The background is enough to get you in the door to then read all those papers. But... the generalism is quite deep in a sense. You know, there's a huge amount out there. And you can't be an expert in all of it. So if you are trying to be opportunistic, do the highest social value things, and, you know, jump at this gap here, this gap here, you almost necessarily have to be a scientific generalist. Yeah. I don't know if I answered your question. GUZEY: [thinks] TREFETHEN: Well, by the way, if you're going to pause, I'll say more. [Chuckles] That's the danger. Today's system of federal funding are not supporting generalists The systems of federal funding are really not set up for generalism. Usually \u2013 I mean, there's some cases you can pick \u2013 but, you know, peer review from your peers in your field is the absolute opposite of generalism. That's notable, when you're able to do organizational design from the ground up, that that is where you end up going is, I think, partly in reaction to the current system. GUZEY: Yeah... I have this crackpot, semi-crackpot thesis for a nonprofit or for a science grant-maker where the thesis of the org is zero peer review. Just take one person and they just decide whether to fund, like, science projects or not to fund. And that's it. And that's... And they're not allowed to seek external peer review. [laughs] It's a countermeasure. And they're probably going to end up funding a bunch of crackpots and a lot of things that don't make sense, but\u2014 TREFETHEN: I'm generally\u2014 one of the sort of, I don't know, almost like meta-level organizational design principles I'm quite a big fan of is \u2013 and I think that is inherited from Alexander , the CEO of Open Philanthropy, who talked a lot about this \u2013 is flexibility. So the reason I don't like that is why ban someone? Don't ban someone. The reason to ban someone is if you need to jostle them out of the system they're otherwise going to get drawn into. But... Yeah. Just give people freedom. Give a peer freedom to... If they want to get external peer review, they can. And, you know, their manager might get mad at them if they make fewer grants because they're doing too much... GUZEY: Well, I mean, the reason I'm thinking about that is because, again, I think I'm just thinking about, like, what happened to me. I never intended to be... Doing grants by committee. And that's what I somehow, like, found myself doing because I was just, like, too scared to... TREFETHEN: Did you have anyone in your life, a board member, who could say, Alexey, \"why are you doing this, why are you doing this?\" Because I think that's a nice role. You know, I have weekly one-on-ones. That's a nice role. If you have someone in your life saying, \"why are you doing this,\" then it can give you permission. That might be a cheaper way than banning. Why are you trying to ban yourself and stuff, Alexey? You just have, you know, a one-on-one every week. Yeah. Say, \"I found that I'm doing this.\" And then in your one-on-one, whoever you're talking to will say, like, \"why are you doing that?\" And then you'll say, \"because I'm scared.\" And then they'll be like, \"then don't do that.\" Problem solved. We did it in a week. GUZEY: Yeah. That has not been my experience. TREFETHEN: Oh, really? GUZEY: Yeah. TREFETHEN: Fair enough. GUZEY: Actually, I mean, this part probably should really not be included, but I think, like, when I'm thinking back on New Science and, like, large parts of what went wrong is that I didn't really have Heather and Chris figures who I could just go and talk to about what I'm doing. Like, I just didn't have anyone to go to and figure out and talk to about what I was doing. How will AI affect the pace of scientific progress? GUZEY: AI FOMO? TREFETHEN: AI FOMO? I have the opposite. I think, if I know what you mean... I feel like every time someone tries to draw me into AI, I'm like, ooh. GUZEY: Okay. So you have the opposite of AI FOMO? TREFETHEN: I'm sure that's been true or false in different ways at different times. So I don't need to claim that's always been true. But... GUZEY: But at the moment? TREFETHEN: Yeah. GUZEY: I guess it's, like, especially in San Francisco, I feel like whenever I come to San Francisco, all of the people I know here, well, except for you, perhaps, are doing something related to AI. You know, there is a couple miles from here, there is Anthropic, another few miles away from here, there is OpenAI and \u2013 you know, the Intelligence Age is almost upon us \u2013 all of these things, and so you're not... not drawn at all to, like, go and become a technical manager at Anthropic or at OpenAI or something like that? So feel free to... We can skip this question. TREFETHEN: No, no, no. It's all fair game. GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: I am not, as a descriptive fact, drawn by that. GUZEY: You don't want to be in the room where AGI is developed? TREFETHEN: I... Not in that framing. No. That sounds horrible. I mean, that sounds... I think that urge that people have... I think that the urge that people have is often trying to meet a personal emotional need rather than a societal need. And I would love if people could meet that personal need through things that don't affect other people's lives quite so extravagantly. So I would see that \u2013 if I were following that urge, I would see that as maybe not the best way to make career decisions. But, you know, I do think there's a lot of incredibly intellectually interesting things happening in all forms of alignment research and also developing new models and also biological foundation models and all this. There's many different frontiers that are being pushed incredibly rapidly. And that is something that I do think... Well, you know, I haven't left San Francisco in a few months now. But the \u2013 I think San Francisco and the rest of the world, they're really in different head spaces, really very different head spaces about what the next five years are going to look like. And I'm sure that my social circle \u2013 I hang out with a lot of friends who work in AI or who have strong views one way or the other on different political problems with AI. So I'm sure I'm influenced by all of that in the way that I think about problems. And, you know, I do think in the case of medical progress, I've been thinking more recently about trying to... Should we \u2013 you won't like this \u2013 I'm just going to go back to talking about my current job instead of \"should I leave and do whatever you want me to do?\" But how should we adapt our portfolio now in the context of potential changes to medical research that are driven by AI progress, and in the context of whenever we make a grant, the impact that actually happens from the grant is many years down the line. So you actually should be thinking ahead rather than thinking the most important thing this year is [gestures] this , so let's do this . You know, you actually have to backchain from years in the future. And I think that I probably do have different views about that that are informed by being in San Francisco than if I \u2013 you know, if we were a biomedical research grant-making organization based in... GUZEY: How does this affect your grant-making? TREFETHEN: So far, not much. And so I wonder, is that a mistake? But the thing that I often turn to is I think you can make educated guesses about... Let me phrase it differently. Let's say that AI progress in a broad sense of language models, but also foundational biology models \u2013 but also this, that, and the other \u2013 continue to make progress at a clip . Biology and biomedicine as a science does indeed drive medical progress. So do you assume that medical progress will move forward at the same clip? And if not, why not? I think one way to break down the question is, which parts of the system of medical research will become bottlenecks in a world that AI continues to progress really fast? I think you can make educated guesses, certainly at the five year level about that and maybe the 10-year level about that. I can give you my guesses, but I think basically the inference is that those are, if you care about the societal impact of whatever you're trying to make in biomedicine, you should relatively speaking focus more on those bottlenecks potentially, rather than just diving into the hot AI stuff that everyone's sort of already pushing ahead really fast. GUZEY: Right... So, what are those things? TREFETHEN: Well, I'm of course not sure. I don't know. But my educated guesses are that\u2014 GUZEY: Because I've been, I mean \u2013 this is also for me, very interesting, right? Because I spent a lot of time thinking about biology, a lot of time thinking about AI, and I am \u2013 I'm not even sure... how exactly will the kind of science being done change? Because in a way we have already \u2013 especially in biology \u2013 we went through this really dramatic transformation where people would spend their entire PhD sequencing a single gene, and now we can sequence an entire genome for a few hundred dollars. In a lot of ways, the biomedical research productivity has already gone, like, just thousands, millions of times over. In a way everything changed about the way we do biology, but also nothing really changed, and I feel like I'm personally very confused about this and we'll just, like, see the same thing \u2013 everything will change in 10 years, but also, kind of, nothing will really change and... TREFETHEN: I have the urge to get a bit more specific about what changed and what didn't because I don't think that all fields of biology changed at the same rate, and it depends what productivity means because I agree with you that over the course of one generation of a scientist's life \u2013 let's take it back to Chris and Heather. Chris Somerville, my colleague, was one of the main guys behind Arabidopsis and, you know, the senior author on the main paper , this was a lot of his career of the model plant organism that gets used a lot. The first time they sequenced the genome of Arabidopsis, it costs \u2013 I think they had like a $100 million grant. So in a way, maybe it costs that. I don't know literally how you'd attribute the sequencing. I don't know how much you got, but, like \u2013 an absurd amount of money. And now you can sequence Arabidopsis for, say, $100, probably less, probably way less, I don't know. But you're talking about real orders of magnitude. The question for me then on, and so it must be absolutely just such a trippy experience for him of, you know, it wasn't that long ago we did the first, like, that was 25 years ago, like, not long. Similarly, with, more recently protein folding, you used to maybe spend a whole PhD trying to work on one protein, and now you can at least take sequence to structure and do really well very quickly. Yeah. Or you can't necessarily\u2014 GUZEY: Yeah, like validate things in a few weeks, right? TREFETHEN: Yeah. GUZEY: Also, we went from, whatever, like, 200 weeks to 2 weeks, something like that. TREFETHEN: Depends specifically on\u2014 GUZEY: Okay, sorry, I don't know enough biology, but also more than an order of magnitude. TREFETHEN: Right, I agree. We're not there on lots of things. You know, that's proteins, and that was built off the protein databank. Are we there for carbohydrates? Are we there for lipids? I haven't seen it. And are we there for protein function ? Well, not yet, no. Function's harder to define than structure. Like, in some contexts, a protein acts this way, and in some contexts, it acts that way. Function's kind of what we care about. There's a long way still to go. When we talk about productivity improvements, you can point to these things that have three orders of magnitude differences. The thing that I always try and backchain from in my seat now \u2013 I'm not saying this is the only reason to do science \u2013 but in my seat right now, that I care about science for health impact, for people, starting from the premise of everyone matters equally, and everyone's life matters equally. I care about productivity that's harder to benchmark. I'm like, \"show me the new life-saving drugs at the end of a pipeline\", and that's a really lagging indicator. It's a cruel one in a way, but I'm extremely confident that we don't have a 1000x improvement in approval of life-saving drugs. You're looking more at the level, okay, what does someone actually do now? What does this structural biologist do now, versus what they did five years ago? Like, what are they actually doing day to day? And are they producing discoveries of similar magnitude, different magnitude? It gets a bit more complicated. I don't think that AI will sweep through as quickly. If you talk to biologists about this, then the classic thing that I'm sure you've heard all the time is like, well, \"Guess what? Alpha Folder is built on $10 billion of previous data collection in the protein data bank.\" So, you're looking around, you're like, \"where do I have a really high quality data set that could get a similar kind of AI-driven, sudden improvement.\" And everyone's doing that now. But then there's an even deeper question, which people in San Francisco talk about \u2013 which hasn't probably [laughs] made it very far beyond San Francisco yet \u2013 which is more around synthetic data or more around designing reasoning agents or scientists that you can then instantiate in a virtual university with a million of them, where they debate and publish papers and all that stuff. So that , um, I don't feel able to make good predictions about that world, because I don't think we've even got anywhere near that, but I think in the next few years, probably we could well do. I feel like we can, you know, like here's one thing that I think will be a block in five years, uh, good targets . Like, we've got really good at designing something that binds to a target, but everyone's going off to the same targets in cancer. There aren't that many known validated good targets, so you can chuck as much money as you want, but if you don't understand how the system works... Similarly, take a brain disease \u2013 Alzheimer's \u2013 we have such poor measurement of what's going on in the brain that, do I think we're really going to get good targets in the next five or 10 years, even with magical AI from the sky? Well, no, because no one's going to open up their brain and be able to take the relevant measurements probably. I can tell the story the other way, if you want me to, but I've rambled for a while... that's \u2013 [smiles] ah, I'll do it. The story the other way is that, \" oh , you don't need high quality data.\" It turns out that if you have a genius from the sky, you can actually learn so much from YouTube videos and learn about how physics works. You can have perfect laws of physics. And then when you have perfect laws of physics and you've just only read PubMed or only ingested such and such dataset of human biology, you can figure out what's probably going on up there, even if you never take any measurements and therefore you can make a perfect Alzheimer's drug. I can't refute that. It's possible that you can have wonderful simulations with our current level of data and you don't need to collect much more. That's not where I would currently place my bets. So I don't think we will have a great cure for Alzheimer's, even with magical AI before it goes through other real world data collection. But I could, I mean \u2013 what do you think about that? AI Baumol Disease GUZEY: I think I agree with you pretty much on all of this. I think one... I guess I think about Baumol's disease and indeed, AI will make sub-problems of problems we care about dramatically easier to do. Like, we care about [gestures] human health and for that we need, say, drugs. And part of getting a drug that works is predicting protein structure at some point to help with \u2013 I don't know enough details \u2013 but it's like part of a bigger problem. And there is like 20 sub-problems, and AI, maybe for five of them, AI will just make them free, essentially, but then you're still left with 15 problems, which probably cannot really be sped up, and that end up just occupying the rest of the time. So I do wonder whether there is some kind of an upper bound on how much AI can speed things up, because I know even at the end of the diseases just progress at a certain rate. TREFETHEN: Totally, totally. GUZEY: And there is this rationalist and empiricist frame, and rationalists say, \"yeah, we can just think very hard, predict,\" and I think I'm just like, especially for complicated systems, now, you need to actually go and do the experiment. Until you run the experiment, you just genuinely don't know. TREFETHEN: Yeah. GUZEY: This makes me very sad, because it's... TREFETHEN: It doesn't make you happy? We have so much to learn. GUZEY: Uh, it makes it\u2014 TREFETHEN: We're alive way before the beginning of biology. GUZEY: Yeah, yeah. I mean, this makes me worried. I think I used to... I kind of bounced around from thinking that \u2013 I mean, the original thesis behind New Science, in a lot of ways, was \"AGI is not near.\" And everything will take decades. We need to really figure out how to make sure that science works well, that basic institutions of science are well functioning for the decades ahead. Then I, like, went through a phase where like, oh wait, yeah it [AI] will change everything in the next few years, so none of this basic stuff of science and institution stuff makes sense, and now I'm back to this point of \"oh, shit the world is going really slow.\" And like, yeah, AI will be strong, but like, it won't change the world. Again, every \u2013 in some ways, everything will change for some problems for which AI is really good at, and for other things, nothing will change. This makes me very... I mean, this is why I'm thinking about institutions of science again, right? [laughs] because I'm like, \"oh, wait, we need to plan for decades ahead and make sure that science works well decades ahead\" and that all these, like, Alzheimer's \u2013 indeed my impressions are that we just we don't really understand, like, biology. We don't really know how to measure things. The brain is still \u2013 it's just like I'm... I feel mortality very acutely now, again. TREFETHEN: What do you mean? GUZEY: I mean, literally, you know, if I don't expect singularity or anything like that happening anytime soon, and if I really think that at the end of the day, you need to run clinical trials for things you really care about and they take years , then you don't really have that many shots on the goal. We have 50 years, 60 years? How much can you do in 50, 60 years? [laughs] TREFETHEN: Well, I mean, the... [stands up and grabs Her-2: The Making of Herceptin, a Revolutionary Treatment for Breast Cancer ] I haven't read this book, but I think it's gonna cheer you up. [tosses the book to Alexey] Here's my gift to you. I just bought it for me, but you can have it. So I think, oh, no... am I thinking of the right, is that Imatinib ? Which is that? Yeah, I don't think that [Imatinib] had a phase three trial. I think it was so good in the phase two \u2013 but someone will correct me in the comments \u2013 so it was so good in the phase two, that they just approved it. It would be unethical not to. And so the happy world for you would be, we have such magical AI systems that an AI system predicts, \"by the way, if you run this in a clinical trial, then there's a 84% chance it will hit endpoint XYZ in 10 years, and we're highly confident it's not gonna cause neuroinflammation and it's not gonna harm your brain for XYZ reasons .\" And then maybe you'll be happy taking it to slow down progression of Alzheimer's. Now, there's a whole other set of questions of, will the policy world adapt to that and in what ways? I think in the case of prevention, you probably will be slower. In the case of treating people who will die of a disease, I think the policy response may be quite quick of \"okay, this AI system spat out a prediction that it's probably gonna work. Do you wanna be in the trial where you might be in the control or just take it?\" I think people would be like, \"okay.\" Anyway, there's my optimistic case. That said, I'm actually more in your... GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: What do I currently believe? Yeah, I think some things still take \u2013 you know, Alzheimer's, if you're taking a daily drug to prevent progression of it, which no one is basically currently, but if we had a future drug \u2013 that totally could have safety problems, you know? So do you want to take it before you've seen, how someone in a clinical trial did after five years, after 10 years? I'm like, not sure. It's sort of pretty slow moving disease. So we might just have to wait for that trial. And it's, that takes time. I think the thing I, if I would cheer you up in a different direction, it's that, the\u2014 GUZEY: [laughs] I like how this interview started from me asking you about your work at Open Philanthropy into you just cheering me up, so I would continue to pray for the future. TREFETHEN: [laughs] Well, I, uh... GUZEY: [laughing] Please continue, I appreciate it. TREFETHEN: Of course, one of the, um\u2014 GUZEY: [laughs] I hope you're doing this for free... TREFETHEN: [smiles] Oh, I assume I'm getting paid for this interview. No, one of the, you know, I was saying earlier about how it's frustrating that there are so few good targets to go after and everyone goes after the same ones. Well, the analog, the disanalog of that in the case of products that help people in lower and middle income country settings, but not so much in high income country settings, is that there are plenty of probably good targets that haven't been explored that much. And, you know, if you're... it's way easier to study a bacteria in a lab and to learn a lot about it as well than to study a human system. You might be able to find quite a lot out about that bacteria, and have quite a few potential antigens that you could go after with a vaccine, for example. If I may squeeze in Strep A into this interview, because any time I'm allowed to, I will. Strep A is a bacteria that you've probably been infected with many times. I have been. It causes strep throat. Do you remember the last time you got strep throat? GUZEY: I used to get strep throat a lot. TREFETHEN: It's very annoying, so mostly it's annoying but sometimes it\u2014 GUZEY: I actually was in the hospital twice when I was younger for it. TREFETHEN: Totally, yeah, it can \u2013 it's real... kids end up in hospitals somewhat frequently for it, and can get an invasive disease where the strep bacteria spreads around your body , and it can cause lots of problems, and it can cause many deaths, actually, in toddlers. In addition, in lots of countries, if you get infected many times, there's an autoimmunity, there's a molecular mimicry issue. Your body's trying to attack the pathogen, but actually ends up attacking your heart valves. So you can get acute rheumatic fever or long-term rheumatic heart disease, which leads to early cardiac problems and death. And if you add up all the problems that strep A causes downstream, the best estimate \u2013 which isn't a great one \u2013 the best estimate that we've got is that it leads to about half a million people dying every year . GUZEY: Oh. TREFETHEN: And you know, when we loop back around to can you even make any comparison between basic science of [gestures] this form or this form? And how will you know what's better than the other? Well, you can look at neglectedness as a pretty good lens and very few people are working on strep A, very, very few. If you look at the total amount of R&D funding dedicated to trying to make a vaccine, for example, or include if you want some more microbiology and basic stuff, and epidemiology of where's rheumatic heart disease happening? The best estimate I've managed to pull together is that there's maybe $1 or $2 of R&D funding per year of life lost due to infections globally, okay? So you shouldn't have an intuition for what that means, but you're gonna get a comparative one in a second, which is that for cancers, it's probably about two orders of magnitude higher. So more like $200. So that doesn't tell you anything immediately because maybe it's impossible to work on strep A, and so there shouldn't be any money spent on it, but I'll give you a hint. It's not impossible to work on strep A! There's quite a lot you could do. And if there were more scientists really laser focused on the problem, you know, there's loads of unanswered questions at the level of what makes a good antigen. There are maybe seven leading hypotheses . GUZEY: This is so weird. TREFETHEN: [nodding] It's very weird, very weird. GUZEY: How come? TREFETHEN: There's a couple drivers. I mean, the deaths are mostly happening in lower middle income countries. So not exclusively though, invasive disease can get you anywhere. GUZEY: Yeah. TREFETHEN: That's a big driver. So another reason is the FDA banned trials for 30, 40 years, and that ban got lifted in 2006 , I think. So that sort of meant that it was hard to build a career in the field or lots of vaccine companies don't have programs where they've looked at. Then in addition, because of the auto-immunity issue, you want to be sure that you're not creating problems with a vaccine. With modern tools, I think you can be pretty sure you're not, but there's a question of what data package will I have to get to prove that there are no safety issues? Then there's a question for vaccine developers of efficacy. It's pretty easy to run a trial against pharyngitis strep throat, because people get that all the time. You and I are at risk of getting that in the next year, so we could enroll in a trial, let alone kids who get it all the time. So you only need maybe a thousand people to run a good trial with that, but if you care about preventing rheumatic heart disease, if you care about preventing necrotizing fasciitis\u2014 GUZEY: Yeah, that takes so long. TREFETHEN: Proving the link is, you know, in a trial, very difficult because the incidence is too low. You won't accrue enough cases of necrotizing fasciitis where it's in your legs and eating your flesh and every hour it moves another inch kind of thing because it's rare enough. Can AI speed up aging research? GUZEY: So I should be pessimistic about the future again? TREFETHEN: No, you should be optimistic because- well, sorry, sorry, you should be pessimistic unless you want to get involved in the fight against strep A. GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: I think if you and your viewers got involved, we could really take a swing at it because you could test a bunch of vaccines for sure, you definitely could. GUZEY: Unfortunately most of our viewers work on things like biosecurity and monitoring, things like that. Instead of taking real problems. TREFETHEN: Oohhhfff, you're insulting your viewers? Wowww, wow. That's interesting. Interesting. Those are real prob\u2014 GUZEY: No pandering to viewers. TREFETHEN: [laughs] Any other swings you want to get in at them? What else are they working on? GUZEY: [laughs] All kind of stupid shit. TREFETHEN: I mean, basically what's the limitation on this problem? There's scientific limitations, human capital limitations and money limitations. GUZEY: Yeah. No, but it is striking to me \u2013 but like the thing that I keep returning to is these things that I do not see a way of speeding up. Like at the end of the day, will we be able to use AI to predict that, or shorten the length of clinical trials from 10 years or 20 years to down to a year? This makes me think that maybe we'll solve, in some basic way, aging, but we'll solve it before all of these diseases. Like we'll understand how the body falls apart, but not... TREFETHEN: So, I don't think we will solve aging before we solve strep A. I think that... GUZEY: Also, sorry, sorry, but since I asked you about this, an immediate follow up is \u2013 since you mentioned that health impact is what you really care about at Open Philanthropy\u2014 TREFETHEN: Yes. GUZEY: Are you guys then trying to solve aging? TREFETHEN: We have given grants many years ago to Irina Conboy and Steve Horvath . We've tilted out of that grant-making for neglectedness reasons. There are now lots of companies popping up funded by wealthy people trying to work on aging, so the neglectedness of the field looks way less. In fact, a lot of the \u2013 you know, what do we have? Money. What can we do? Give people money. That's sort of our job. A lot of the money flowing into the field is now bottlenecked on people, that it's just pumping out salaries as far as I can tell. So for aging right now, we've pulled back. But we've done some in the past, yeah. It's interesting that as a sector [aging] is so company focused relative to other sectors, nowadays, but I think that's for various sociological reasons. What is aging? Infectious disease is a part of aging. Inflammation is a part of aging. Heart disease kills however many people, and if you could solve heart disease, you'd solve aging in some way. There's these pendulums that swing in discourse of like, broader society is often focused on specific diseases, and people rightly, 5 or 7 years ago, were like \"hold on, in the case of aging, are there cross-cutting functions and cross-cutting drivers that if you could solve those would help with all sorts of diseases?\". I think that's a really valuable lens shift. Sometimes, I wonder if we've gone too far in that direction now, of like, well actually you could cure cancer and you could cure heart diseases. That'd be pretty cool. So, I'm not sure at the margin, where I'd go there. I expect that the stuff we're funding because it's so much more neglected, if we weren't giving support to those scientists, then they're not getting money elsewhere. So, that makes the case much easier from an impact point of view. GUZEY: Right. TREFETHEN: You don't want to make a strep A vaccine together? I think we could bash that one out. I think we could do that, I mean, not you and me \u2014 GUZEY: [feigning disappointment] oh TREFETHEN: But we could help scientists who are doing that. GUZEY: I thought we'd... [looks down] TREFETHEN: Okay fiiiiine, you and me. GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: You twist my arm. We can work on strep A. You know, I didn't want to work on strep A until this interview, but if you're going to keep pushing me like this. GUZEY: I mean you keep bringing it up. Every time you talk to someone, you keep talking strep A, you know\u2014 TREFETHEN: I'm a real freak like that. GUZEY: Maybe it's time to put your money where your mouth is. TREFETHEN: Yeah. The wisest people Jacob & Alexey know GUZEY: Who's the wisest person you know? TREFETHEN: Oh, my gosh. Who I know? I don't know. Maybe \u2013 can I give boring answers? Probably, like, my friend Sarah back at home. And my mom. I don't know. GUZEY: [laughing] Wonderful. Tell us about Sarah. That\u2019s such a fun answer. TREFETHEN: I haven't discussed before this interview if she would be... I don't know. I just feel like when you, what is wisdom? I feel like I'm often seeking a \u2013 what would someone with good character do in situations that I'm in? And sometimes I think of Sarah. But what is wisdom? Let's see. There are many people who I either know or have a more parasocial relationship with that I view them as bringing out the best in me, but I don't know if that's always wisdom. Well, which lane do you want me to pick? People I don't know or who I do kno? Or, no, no, no, I'll blur the edges: [gestures] Seemay Chou , Prachaya Vasti , who are making Arcadia , I find inspiring from up close and from afar. As you know, we sort of hang out in circles that talk about changing scientific institutions and that are trying to be more ambitious and different with how science is done. And they are really living it. They are living it. They've created a whole new institution that is iterating like crazy on doing experiments and how should you rethink publishing, and how should you, uh, rethink stopping investigating something? Like at what stage do you stop? Because of the opportunity costs, you know, you shouldn't investigate everything forever. When you do stop, what can you publish so other people can know? They\u2019re actually living a lot of what I sort of think about. So that\u2019s really cool. [gestures] Heidi Williams , she is an economist who I think has this presence that brings everyone along with her, and she\u2019s just so prosocial and public goods-focused. [gestures] A friend, Nan Ransohoff who runs Stripe Climate . She actually has this sort of similar to Heidi description I just gave. She somehow makes the world actually move towards creating whole new technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. I'm sort of like, what? How? I feel like it's dangerous to give out one's idols because then they might know. And then they might \u2013 I have to \u2013 okay, I'll hold back on some of them. Virginia Woolf though. She can know. GUZEY: She's coming for you now. TREFETHEN: Who do you think is the most wise? GUZEY: Tyler Cowen. TREFETHEN: Tell me more. GUZEY: When I look back over the years, who are the people who I wish I listened more to? He is like at the top, just like consistently somehow tells me things that I think I should have thought about before. And then I ignore him. And then a few years later, I'm like, oh wait, Tyler told me about this a few years before. TREFETHEN: It's a good way. GUZEY: Yeah, I noticed that whenever I think about things that are very difficult, I ask myself \u201chow would Tyler think about this?\u201d more often than for any other person. He\u2019s kind of a scary person. He's too wise. TREFETHEN: [laughs] Good thing to aim for, I suppose. GUZEY: So how will science be different in the 21st century? TREFETHEN: Too big, too big. GUZEY: Role of academia? TREFETHEN: Role of academia? GUZEY: You mentioned that for aging, for example, for sociological reasons, it's a problem that often for-profit companies are funded by people who really care about the problem directly affecting them, perhaps. And then right then I know, I guess I think a lot about context for this in my head. I can't stop thinking about this graph of NIH funding distribution . We're like, ages 35 and less like this, and just 65 more like this. And I think at this point, it's like primary investigators ages 65 and older are getting funded at 7x the rate of those 35 and younger, I believe, something like that. And it keeps getting worse. So this makes me\u2014 TREFETHEN: [nods] That is crazy. GUZEY: Yeah, this is just like bonkers. I think a lot about what Tyler Cowen said, with Emergent Ventures , where you just fund really young, talented people. And Tyler Cowen once said that it seems that young people are getting accelerated actually, because the internet just allows people to learn much more, to get up to speed a lot more. Tyler pointed out an example of chess where Magnus was pretty young when he became world champion and the person who Tyler expects to be the new world champion is like 17 or something crazy like that. And so the top performance keeps getting younger. I was recently talking to a professor of physics at MIT and was asking him about the preparedness for research of undergrads and grad students these days. And he told me the same thing that because of the internet sometimes the best undergrads are better prepared today than like 10 or 20 years ago. So in my head, there is this thing about on one hand, it seems that naturally young people are getting accelerated and like they should be getting more funding and more support and like, should be getting up to speed faster. And like in software, obviously. Or, like even you [Jacob], you are now, whatever, like 30 or so. Maybe you look younger [laughs], but you're now running this big thing at Open Philanthropy, right? And on the other hand, it seems that academia is not reacting to that at all. In fact, it's like the professors are getting older and then there is this AI thing and I think it also pulls away the most talented. For example, a bunch of the most talented grad students I know in biology who I would have expected them to go and become professors and they all \u2013 well, not all, but the most talented ones, a bunch of them \u2013 just started biotech companies immediately after graduating PhD, even though I would have been sure they're the kind of people who I think would like, for them, the perfect career path would be to become a professor around the lab. And so I have all of these things in my head and I am famously a person who likes to criticize academia a lot, but I do wonder if there is going to be some kind of a trend where more and more research on the basic one will just be done by other sources, maybe it's going to be, you know, Tyler funds the 20-year-old and Open Philanthropy funds the person when they're 23 and then they're just now running their own lab doing whatever it is that they want to do, sidestepping the entire system. And then with the help of AI also like one of the things that I feel like AI will do is just amplify the top performers. Like in biology, if you don't need to... if the experiments are done by robots, intellectually intensive work is going to be more and more outsourced and individuals get more leverage as well. And so there is, I feel like this aspect. Anyway, sort of been rambling. TREFETHEN: There's a lot of different parts of this picture, I think. Maybe a place to start is just me personally, and that's what I know best is my own life. And, you know, I view biology as one of the consolations of aging. There\u2019s an unlimited nexus of different things you could know about cell biology, about different organs and diseases and all that, so that every year it feels better and better. It's so wonderful. The accumulation of knowledge. And I know so little, but next year I know a little more and then I know a little more. And that's sort of, you know, as I realize I will get older, that's been a nice field to go into because I think biology does actually sort of inherently, no, inherent isn't right, but it does reward accumulation of knowledge and connections rather than just raw \u201cthink my way through a problem\u201d talent. So I think I dispute some of the premise in that I think some forms or some fields will have top performers of different ages. And then within any given field, you will get heterogeneity anyway. I totally agree with the punchline for what it's worth though, of even within biology, I don't think even the NIH wants the \u2013 who is the NIH? \u2013 But I think a lot of people at NIH probably feel quite awkward about how high the median age is of PI's getting grants. And I mean, I view that as one of the big contributions of the work you've done, also of the ARC Institute, also of the meta-science community that's been building over the last few years as a kind of a broad group of people interested in trying to make science go better. Is this just highlighting this fact more and is the solution to that fact that you build more institutions that empower younger people sooner? Is the solution that you try and reform the NIH? Or is it somewhere in the middle? Like the Art Institute are put sort of in the middle of they're working with the existing universities in the area, Stanford and UCSF, and they work with Berkeley as well, I can't remember, but they're empowering certain people with much more resources and much sooner than you would. And that's great. So that's definitely a direction I agree with \u2013 sold, that should change. I don't know how it breaks down into what I would change. Then... now I'm wondering what other parts of the question to pick up on. What will happen to academia broadly? GUZEY: Okay. Proportion of revolutionary basic science done within like... Universities versus outside universities. TREFETHEN: As I think through, well, what do I really believe about that question and what drives it? One thing that is coming to mind is how many of the discoveries of the future will come from big science or big collaborative efforts, like the Human Genome Project, like AlphaFold requiring so much of an institution to... be behind it and the compute and all of that, like telescopes. Pick your examples that are kind of big, big collaboration versus the discoveries that just won the Medicine Nobel Prize this year . I don't know that story well, and I'm curious if you do actually, but microRNAs \u2013 that was basically, you know, you can discover that in the 90s in a lab and that's kind of what they won it for. As I think through the big discoveries, the big discoveries... As I think through some discoveries from the last 30 years, a lot of the blockbuster ones do seem to have come from more of these big collaborations. You could view the Baker Lab that way, even though it's one lab. You know, the Institute of Project Design has tens \u2013 or maybe a hundred now \u2013 of students and just a couple of professors, but a lot of those students end up getting faculty positions. They've been trained on their Rosetta tools . They end up using them in their new position, feedback in and build a tool. So how do you count that in terms of size? I do think that purposefully set up organizations with, you know, more regular managerial structures than academia can outperform on some of those big problems. I mean, it's happening right now in fusion. Who's going to end up adding the most value, these new fusion companies or the big government funded projects or national labs? I don't know the answer to that. But I really... I wouldn't be surprised if, frankly, because of wealth accumulation due to tech as well, it was like there's some really rich people now. They can do that, you know, projects they want to do in a private company because we support property rights in America. So where does that wealth go is almost going to drive some of the answer rather than the more bottom up scientist led answers to the question, probably. The future of science in academia TREFETHEN: Do you have hope for academia? And if so, what kind of hope? GUZEY: I have hope for undergrad part of universities. I think people, especially in Silicon Valley, underappreciate the value of a college degree funnily enough. But it's mostly because of the exposure. It's like a very nice track to be on where you can just like meet a lot of people, explore a lot of different things, talk to and meet a lot of professors, meet people your age, take any class you want. Socialize, have fun. But in terms of academia afterwards, I am... I mean I feel like I'm professionally obligated to say no in some way because I'm literally working on building new institutions of basic science. But in a way there is... The way I think about academia now is that it's like... Professional science. I think academia has always been really good at professional science and paradigmatic science. And it's probably going to remain actually pretty good at this kind of thing, whereas I'm personally just more interested in pre-paradigmatic research and generalists doing things like... Uh, I know it seems that like, this is kind of a stupid example, but like Darwin, right? Like he spent whatever, a couple of decades writing his Origin of Species and probably would not do well at all in academia and I think all of the researchers that I'm most interested in somehow don't quite fit in. They can't get funding. They are just too weird for academia. They work on things that are too long term, too poorly defined\u2014 TREFETHEN: Is that right? Don't you like lots of... I think of the people you've told me you love before, some of them are doing pretty well in academia. I don't know if you want me to out them on the podcast. GUZEY: Well, we can, we can always cut things out. TREFETHEN: Ed Boyden is doing pretty well. GUZEY: That's the most ridiculous example you could have come up with. Because Ed Boyden, the only reason he's still in academia is because of you guys, because he was about to close down his fucking lab at MIT and then you came in, Open Philanthropy and gave him a huge grant and now he's doing well and he recovered and didn't NIH literally reject him like nine times in a row. Like I remember he said that in some of his interviews that his expansion microscopy , now one of the most successful projects coming out of his lab, was literally rejected nine times before it got funded. By who? [motions at Jacob] TREFETHEN: [laughs] GUZEY: Open Philanthropy. I think that's a great example. TREFETHEN: It's interesting that that's your narrative on it. Not that I had anything to do with that decision. So when we made the original grant to him, I wasn't there, but of course I'm willing to take the praise if you want to give it. It would be super interesting to ask him what he thinks would have happened to his career in the absence of that grant. So I think what would have happened to expansion microscopy is a different question. I mean, expansion microscopy is crazy. I cannot believe how big that's gone. Like jeez, I can't believe it worked and it's gone so big. It's like, what? So yeah, that's one of those where you're if you make one of those grants, you can just pack it up and retire kind of. But I wonder, I mean, he's so talented that in other ways that wouldn\u2019t he have found something great to do with that? I don't know. Anyway, you know him better than I have, I've met him once in my life, so I don't know. GUZEY: No, I think that's actually a very good question to explore. Like what, what would he have done? I do think academia is doing... like, he\u2019s restricted as a result. I mean \u2013 I actually \u2013 I remember like I used to lobby Open Philanthropy\u2014 TREFETHEN: You once sent me an email saying you need to give Ed Boyden a hundred million dollars. And I said, thank you so much. Or maybe I ghosted you. I probably ghosted you. GUZEY: I think I was sending this email to Holden, to you, to anyone at Open Philanthropy I had an email for. And you guys never did. TREFETHEN: Not yet, not yet. GUZEY: Yeah. And I think it would have been better for the world if Ed Boyden had a hundred million grant to start his own thing instead of being in academia. I think a lot about the fact that he still lives within that system. Where he has to like constantly churn out papers, constantly apply for grants. He's constrained by the fact that he has students who are with him for five years. I would really love to see if Ed Boyden just had like 20 years of funding for an institute. Like, what would have happened? And I suspect that something way more interesting would have happened. How Open Philanthropy uses neglectedness to make funding trade-offs TREFETHEN: When you talk about duration of funding and flexibility of funding, to a funder, what looms large are the trade-offs. GUZEY: Yeah. Trade-offs, of course. TREFETHEN: Unfortunately. Yeah. GUZEY: I'm an Internet writer who just pesters people and sends them emails telling them to fund this and that. And you're the person who has constraints, who needs to make decisions, who faces trade-offs, the famous economics thing that sometimes features in our life. TREFETHEN: Here's an example of a trade-off. If you give someone a four-year grant versus a 20-year grant, that's five times less money. Example: The UK biobank is so useful already, and we know it's going to get more useful over time as it accumulates more data. Does that mean that you should just endow it? Just give it as much money as an institution that can continue for decades, and don't faff around with all these grants that they have to write. And that's an argument that actually I find a bit more persuasive than pick your favorite scientists in 2024, give them 20 years of funding. Although I'm curious, how many scientists in the world would you think of the 20-year thing? Because, you know, for example, HHMI , how many investigators are there? I'm not sure, actually. But there's quite a few. You know, it's... It's a very limited set of science, but it's probably... GUZEY: Three thousand? TREFETHEN: Yeah. Well, hundreds of thousands, say. And that's... Okay. So that's already a lot. Would you halve it and double the period? Would you double it and halve the period? Or are you talking about there are five Ed Boydens in the world, and it ain't about the 500? Oh, okay. Interesting. So list them. Who\u2019re your faves? GUZEY: Do you have anyone except Ed Boyden? Michael Levin , perhaps. Tufts . TREFETHEN: What would the annual size of your 20-year grant be? GUZEY: For Boyden, yeah, probably between 50 and 100 million... a year. TREFETHEN: [laughs] GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: That's beautiful. Thank you. That's really... GUZEY: That's like 20% of your endowment, right? Something like that. TREFETHEN: Yeah. But hey, it's a pitch. How would that get spent? So let's divide it out. How much is a postdoc's salary? How many people are in this lab? GUZEY: Yeah, that seems... TREFETHEN: I just think you get management constraints in labs. Like, you know, you... GUZEY: No, that seems too much. How many people can he... Actually, that probably... No, that's... Probably closer to the order of $10 million per year. I think if it were more than that it\u2019s not just a Boyden thing. [laughs] We'll see if I'm brave enough to leave this in. TREFETHEN: [laughs] GUZEY: Hopefully no one who is considering giving money to my non-profit is watching. TREFETHEN: If I were you, the productive line of inquiry, I would sort of advocate for myself is to just really scrutinize the trade-offs more. Because you can do a lot of damage with $1 million. You can really fund work that won't happen without it. And that work can be towards a goal that you think might... In our case, we work on biomedical science. So towards a goal that you think might prevent tens of thousands of deaths a year, maybe hundreds of thousands of deaths. And the trade-offs get very acute when you're facing down the barrel of do we fund this marginal Malaria monoclonal antibody project? We just funded Alassane Dicko in Mali to do a phase one to a trial that's basically never been done before, of a potentially transmission-blocking antibody that you could give maybe in combination with something that would have personal protection, too. And, oh my gosh, if that worked, just imagine. Right now, there's seasonal malaria chemoprevention that kids in many West African countries will get, which is taking preventive drugs that you swallow, you know, a few times, four months in a row. Kids hate the drugs. You find them in the trash. You know, like, not everyone finishes the regimen, all that. And they're not perfect. Even if you finish the regimen, imagine if you had one fucking \u2014 oh, sorry \u2014 one injection that protected you for a whole season, because you had a really good monoclonal and it involved a transmission-blocking component that reduced malaria spread to other people because there's fewer parasites in your body for every other reason. Then, oh my God, and guess what? That did not cost $10 million a year for 10 years. So the tradeoffs in science can be so intense because that's a great project. I'm very glad we funded it. And there's lots of other... That's not the only amazing project. There's many other ones, too. Some of them are in Mali, and some of them are in Thailand, and some of them, you know, they're not all at MIT. So, you know, if you're... GUZEY: I think about this just... I'm just so much more interested in basic science and methods development. It just seems... Whenever I think about funding things, I always want to fund methods development, essentially. And so this is why I'm so excited about Boyden, for example. TREFETHEN: Okay, let me sell you another one, that maybe we can meet in the middle on\u2014 GUZEY: Again, I'm, like, I'm thinking about, like, the reason I'm, like... TREFETHEN: So do you mean, like, tools as well? Like, microfluidic chips , do they get you going? GUZEY: Maybe. I don't think I... After I said this $100 million a year thing, now I'm very worried about saying anything because that is very stupid. TREFETHEN: No, that wasn't stupid. I was not trying to shame you for that being stupid. GUZEY: I'm trying to think of, like, 50-year time horizon, something like that. TREFETHEN: Yeah, I don't like the 50-year time horizon. I think the world changes too much. I'm into 10. You can get me at 10. GUZEY: Yeah, 10, I'm just, like, at 10... Again, if we're thinking about really understanding how the brain works, really understanding how aging works, really understanding Alzheimer's, will we get there in 10 years? TREFETHEN: I don't think we will, no. GUZEY: Yeah, so why not think of 20 years? Because it seems like if we think about 10-year horizons, then we'll never find this Alzheimer's stuff. TREFETHEN: But, you know, the trouble is, play it back. It's, well, let's say... GUZEY: Are you saying that if it's not tractable within 10 years... Then it's just too early to be finding this problem, essentially? TREFETHEN: No, no, no no. I don\u2019t mean that. I don't mean that. I mean: if you're trying to attack Alzheimer's and you think it's a 50-year problem, the reason I would still try and think in 10-year chunks is that tools from other parts of biology, from AI, from whatever, will sweep in and hopefully be helpful in 10 years in a way that you can't predict now. So, if you just pick, I'm going to focus on Alzheimer's, I'm going to fund on Alzheimer's right now, but you don't yet have, you know, a clever probe that non-invasively detects XYZ that you end up getting in 10 years, then the work you did might not be that useful. GUZEY: The way I think about this is if I think about 50 years for Alzheimer's, then this kind of... where the middle ground is, it suggests that pure Alzheimer's \u2013 pure biological Alzheimer's research \u2013 is just not the right thing to fund right now for the reasons that you outlined, and, indeed, they're like more basic methods development things that will in the next 10 years get developed, and then over the course of coming decades really affect how more object-level Alzheimer's research is done \u2013 is the right thing. So, this is why I'm interested in methods. I think you're right to say \u2013 I think you are right. Your argument is entirely correct, but I think in my case the fundamental thing I care about is still that the time horizon is too long, but the fact that there is such a long time horizon means that we need to move up the stack and fund something that will contribute to it over the longer term. TREFETHEN: Okay. Yeah, I think the higher you move up the stack, the harder it is to know, you might end up not funding science. Maybe you end up funding something completely different, depending how high you go up the stack. GUZEY: Yeah, yeah, I think this is indeed, but I think a lot of things that are funded there, it's probably not going to be like theoretical physics, but it is going to be somewhere between, you know, applied physics and biometrics development... TREFETHEN: I think, yeah, that\u2019s cool. If you do end up\u2013 GUZEY: Does this like \u2013 you kind of, like, said it's cool and then didn't comment on this but like, does this make sense? [laughs] TREFETHEN: Well, you know, if I was trying to work on Alzheimer's, which we have done some of the thing that we really try and avoid is working on conventional theories or on conventional approaches to the problem, because NIA \u2013 the part of NIH that funds Alzheimer's \u2013 the budget, you should fact-check me on this, but my memory is, like five years ago, or maybe seven years ago, when we started doing the funding, the budget was maybe 800 million a year on Alzheimer's, and now it's gone up to like 3 billion or 2.5 billion. It's gone way up. So they're going to fund a lot of stuff, which is great, but that means that we have to go really contrarian. Within Alzheimer's, we go really contrarian. And so we look for unusual lines of evidence, and one that has been very interesting to watch, and that I was wrong about relative to my colleagues, Chris and Heather, and others \u2013 so, I place so much weight on neglectedness, and that I'm like, there's so much money in Alzheimer's. There's so much money in Alzheimer's. How the hell can we do anything in Alzheimer's? And then Chris and Heather were like \u201cyeah, but a lot of that money is absolute trash.\u201d You know, like, who cares about that money? And I go, \u201cno, but if it's there, then if you have a project idea, still, you've got a better chance of getting some of it, right?\u201d You know, we have this kind of debate. And they ended up funding a very unusual line of evidence with a relatively early career scientist to take on the next step of what has been a 30-year project by a more senior scientist in Columbia, Francisco Lopera , who worked with an extended family in Columbia who have familial Alzheimer's. They tend to develop Alzheimer's in their 40s, and there are thousands of people in this family over many years sort of working with them. Then there's this group in Boston, Yakeel Quiroz and Joe Arboleda-Velasquez , that looked in a huge amount of depth at one member of the family \u2013 or actually maybe two members of the family \u2013 who did not develop Alzheimer's in their 40s, but in fact went on to develop it in their 60s, so a long time afterwards. And you're like, well, what the hell happened there? This is a genetic form of Alzheimer's, so how the hell did they avoid it? This is the polar opposite of something like our TB vaccine grant, where there are thousands or tens of thousands of people, and you're taking a little bit of knowledge from each sample. This is like, there are two people, and you're going really in-depth and trying to learn as much as friggin' possible. From those studies, there have come out potentially new targets \u2013 which would be wild if they end up being useful targets \u2013 of the Christchurch allele and the RELN gene variant that they've mapped really carefully from looking at these brains, like what actually it looks like might have happened biochemically, and okay, maybe it makes sense of this observation in this other part of the literature 15 years ago. So now maybe RELN is a gene you can try and play with as a drug target, maybe the Christchurch allele is important. And that you would never in a million years get from a conventional medical school or a conventional type of exercise on amyloid beta or whatever. You just wouldn't ever get that. You have to go back and think what is this, how can I get something really weird to play into the story? Now I forget the original question. I just got excited by that story. [pause] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So how up the stack do you go? I don't know. I think you might want to do a mix. I'm not sure I'd go \u2013 there's still some low-hanging fruit left around, but there's so much money, I'd probably go up the stack. But we've done some down the stack as well. We've funded a trial of a sleep drug , where, you know [gestures] if you sleep, that is good for you. GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: Oh, God. I actually didn't, as I started saying this... GUZEY: I... I sleep. TREFETHEN: I was not planning this. This was not an attack. GUZEY: It's okay. I sleep a lot these days. TREFETHEN: That's great. And if you can sleep half an hour more, which on suvorexant , this drug, you probably can, then what happens if you randomize people, give some people this drug? They sleep for half an hour more. Will that affect their progression of Alzheimer's? GUZEY: Wow. Did you fund this? TREFETHEN: We did fund this . I mean, we haven't got the results. I'm very curious. GUZEY: This is great. I'm excited. This is exactly what I wanted to see. This is exactly the kind of sleep study I wanted to see. There are no RCTs where you just make people sleep more or less. TREFETHEN: God, I can't believe I didn't tell you this earlier, given ... We haven't done much in sleep, but... GUZEY: Wonderful. Well, I'd be happy to see that my writing is making some impact... probably not, but cool. TREFETHEN: [laughs] Jacob\u2019s advice and views on purpose GUZEY: Advice for a talented 20-year-old watching this? TREFETHEN: Oh, God. I don't know. Giving advice is so... People gave me advice when I was 20, and it didn't work. GUZEY: How about advice to your 20-year-old self? Do you have any? TREFETHEN: It's so hard, Alexey, because life ends up being what it is. And I can now see with more clarity what decisions I made ended up changing my life a lot. GUZEY: Yeah. TREFETHEN: What do I do with that, though? You know, I don't see the other side. I didn't notice at the time that much that deciding to move to San Francisco when I was 22 would be a big decision that would have lots of downstream changes in my life. And now I have a group of best friends here. I have no plans to leave anytime soon. My job is here. My value system, I'm sure, is infected by lots of people around me. So, did I know when I, on a whim \u2013 roughly on a whim \u2013 did that in 2015 after grad school that it would be one of the... I narrativize it as one of the best decisions I've made. So, I guess maybe that's my advice to a 20-year-old Jacob. Just do what you're about to do. It's really good. Then, there's sort of more personal, like, what are the other really big ones? Whether you decide to break up with certain people or date certain people and all that. So, but not that generalizable. Then\u2014 GUZEY: Any love advice you'd give to a 20-year-old Jacob? TREFETHEN: Love advice? Well, when I was 20, I was very happily \u2013 [laughs] I was about to say very happily married, but that's not true \u2013 I was a very conventional 20-year-old. I dated the same man for all of undergrad and had a wonderful relationship. So maybe my 20-year-old self was on to something, you know, he had it pretty good. Then, I think I have all sorts, actually, of sort of smaller romantic advice, but probably not for the podcast. GUZEY: Advice for me? TREFETHEN: Wait, hold on. But can... I don't want to give it, but do you want to give it? Do you have romantic advice? [laughs] That's what your listeners tune in for. GUZEY: My romantic advice for younger Alexey? TREFETHEN: Yeah, well, don't go there if you don't want to go there. GUZEY: My romantic advice to my younger self was when we had this eight-hour-long conversation in May of 2022 when I was very conflicted about a lot of things, I should have followed up with you sometime soon afterwards instead of just kind of sweeping everything we talked under the rug and trying to pretend nothing happened, and then it just blew up months later. Yeah. But I think it's the same thing, actually. It's very much the same thing as with New Science, where you just didn't have people to talk to about things. And that it\u2019s this weekly thing where I would occasionally talk to someone about things that were happening in New Science. But if I talked once and talked through all the problems, it only happens once, there is no follow-up, so it doesn't actually matter. I think the biggest thing that I do differently now is I just talk to my friends consistently about what's happening in my life. TREFETHEN: Oh, cool. GUZEY: That's, yeah, I think that's universal advice. Talk to your friends who are not conflicted with you, not competitive with you, and who listen to you and who tell you what their thoughts are on whatever is happening. Yeah, I think that\u2019s the single biggest life lesson, in a way. TREFETHEN: I co-sign that. You make me realize some of my life lessons are just learning from the inside the things that now sound trite. Another angle on talking to your friends more about what's going on in your life is, like, who are your friends? The trite thing is completely true. The people you spend the most time with then shape who you are in terms of your values and what you think about. I now understand that somewhat because I've changed. I can see the ways I've changed. I'm blind to many of them, I'm sure, but I can see some of them. And I can see the influence of particular people. I can see the influence of one particular person in this room, actually, in the way this room is set up. So, yeah, I think the extended mind as located in your closest friends or family or partner or children is very real. And so, that has various implications, yeah. I'm with you. \\ And if you don't like someone that much and you end up spending time with them anyway, you will become close to them and you will become more like them. That's another one. GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: There are different ways that can happen to people. Like, you hang out with your partner's friends a lot, for example. It's one. GUZEY: What's the meaning of life? TREFETHEN: At least we got easier than academia in 50 years. Of course, I dispute the question, but... You want one word, one sentence, one? GUZEY: Whatever suits you? TREFETHEN: I mean, if it's one word. Love is pretty close to the meaning of life in one word. So, maybe I'll go with that. GUZEY: Can you expand? TREFETHEN: That would be more than one word. How pretentious do you want me to go? I can... GUZEY: I would say, okay, just say whatever you want. And then if you aren\u2019t... we can cut it. [laughs] TREFETHEN: [laughs] GUZEY: But I'm curious. TREFETHEN: Maybe I'll relate it to our conversation about science and about methods. I think some of the most confusing parts of being alive are that the questions that I care about most, or that people in general maybe care about most, are not always well matched to the methods we have for producing generalizable knowledge. So, for example, a lot of the most important questions are in the social realm. And the methods of social science do not produce generalizable knowledge as much, as often as people want. And, you know, there's famous debates about which ones produce knowledge that's generalizable and in which ways. There is progress in those methods. I was just talking to a friend about progress in diff-and-diff and how you change the staggering of how you do diff-and-diff in economics. You know, you can make methodological progress, but... And then some of the questions are, like, you know, is there a God? And what is the meaning of life? And why do I feel this way when it doesn\u2019t make any sense? Why do I feel so overwhelmed, what does it mean? Or, I feel nothing... The things that matter so much, we have no methods, or we have very weak methods. So we live in a state of knowledge-lessness about the things that touch us most deeply. To try and make that more professional, if the things that matter most often don\u2019t touch the scientific methods, what does that imply for our jobs? I sometimes wonder about that. To get back to your first question, why am I doing what I\u2019m doing? I think what I'm doing, I can see value in without having to answer deeper questions about what is valuable. Because if you give people the chance to not die of preventable diseases, I don't have to have a further normative sense of what is good for them, what is good for the world. I can just know that those people will go on to do whatever they end up doing, whatever they want to do. They'll have families. And so it's a philosophically easier area to work in because I don't have to solve impossible questions. I don't know. That's probably mostly a dodge of your question. Jacob\u2019s favorite joke GUZEY: Can you tell me your favorite joke? TREFETHEN: A joke that my friendship group riffs on commonly, so maybe this counts as my favorite joke, have you seen Airplane! ? The movie, Airplane! ? GUZEY: [shakes head] TREFETHEN: That's a huge one for you. You get to watch it for the first time. It's a kind of old slapstick-ish movie. And there's a recurring joke that I'll try and remember one instantiation of, which is... So they're on an airplane. It's in the title. And someone's having a medical problem. And so a doctor coming down the aisle grabs the air steward and says, \u201cThis woman is in trouble. We need to find a place to land the plane. She's got to go to hospital \u2013\u201d or, \u201cwe need a hospital.\u201d Ah, I fucked up the delivery... GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: Okay, let's start again. Ready? Wait, how does it go? How does my favorite joke go? Okay. \u201cWe need to land this plane. She needs a hospital.\u201d \u201cA hospital? What is it?\u201d \u201cIt's a big building with patients in, but that's not important right now.\u201d GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: [laughs] Then there's another version. It goes like, \u201cThere's a problem in the cockpit.\u201d \u201cThe cockpit? What is it?\u201d \u201cIt's the small room at the front with the pilots in, but that's not important right now.\u201d GUZEY: [laughs] TREFETHEN: And so, Alexey, I'm worried about how this recent podcast I did went. GUZEY: What's a podcast? TREFETHEN: You have to say, \u201coh, what is it?\u201d GUZEY: Oh, what is it? Oh, sorry. Let's do it together. Let's do it together. TREFETHEN: Alexey, I'm not feeling great about this. I'm worried about this recent podcast I did. GUZEY: Oh, what is it? TREFETHEN: A podcast. It's a recording of two men sitting in front of each other talking about \u2013 it's not important right now. It doesn\u2019t have to be two men, but it statistically is. GUZEY: [laughs] Statistically, that\u2019s great. TREFETHEN: Cool, thank you. GUZEY: Thanks for doing this.",

Traveling around. Good to visit San Francisco, as always.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> How long are you here for?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> For a few days, I think. Flying to the East Coast afterwards. One of the main reasons I'm here is, in fact, to talk to you.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I'm honored. Well, thank you for coming by. Thanks for coming to make it easy for me.</p><h2><strong>On Open Philanthropy's decision process</strong></h2><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> You run science funding at Open Philanthropy. You spend a lot of time thinking about global health R&amp;D and more basic science.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> And we have a process where program officers and I have to agree at least 50% of the time. So, in fact, we end up agreeing quite a bit more. Probably more like 75, 80% of the time, currently.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> That's kind of a brilliant way to structure this, actually.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> That's&#8211; yeah. I think it might get the best of both worlds, because we are trying to take bets with these grants that have asymmetric upside, hopefully.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/hits-based-giving/\">Hits-based giving</a> is a framing that we'll often use. We care about the 5, 10% percent of grants that are really, really epic at the end of the day. And it's totally fine if the rest of the grants that we fund don't end up leading so much. So within science, especially, where you can't really predict the future very well, that model, I think, is going to outperform from a social impact point of view something that is more structured.</p><p>We have a highly autonomous system. You could argue that it's always about the margins of how far you go. NIH or NSF or <a href=\"https://wellcome.org/\">Wellcome Trust</a> &#8211; or pick your other funder &#8211; will often have peer review that does maybe give you more signal. We steal the program manager-type role from offers a little bit &#8211; of you have one person who has a budget and they have a lot of autonomy within it &#8211; to get the benefits of \"you can't get vetoed\". POs [Program Officers] cannot veto each other's grants with certain very limited asterisks. And that's wonderful because you don't have to persuade people.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> You know, of course, PO performance gets assessed over time. So, at a yearly level, you can't disagree more than 50%, and then at a longer term level, if you're making lots of grants that look way above the bar set by global health charities, then Open Philanthropy should allocate more money to that program. It's a slightly more complicated long run system than I'm painting. But anyway, we think it gets the best of both worlds. Overall, my opinion is that science funding does involve too much&#8230; a <em>little bit</em> too much peer review, probably. And we're in one direction of like <em>really little</em> peer review. Program officers can decide \"I would like to get external peer review\" on something. And they often do because they cannot be experts in everything they fund.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> This is interesting to me because I've been thinking about this a lot. And I also had experience like running a science organization, funding science projects, right? And I used to talk about how terrible peer review is beforehand. And then in retrospect, the first thing that I ended up instituting was peer review because I was so scared of making decisions. And it's like, well, I'm not a specialist, and then I had always tried to make sure that everyone agrees on what we're doing. In retrospect, something like 50% is a great idea.</p><p>I also immediately start to think about like, okay, what would be the dynamics of the system where, like so you say we have a program officer and they don't have to commission peer review, but they can, and they want to, and &#8211; I'm like, okay, if you just have the system, then over time, probably what's going to happen is that it's going to tend towards like commissioning peer review becoming the norm. And then not asking for peer review will be kind of weird, even if technically you're not like you don't need to. And just because like, again, people are pressured to minimize risks. And then you can always blame others if you commission peer review versus not. But they also like, again, this gets me back to this 50% benchmark. If you notice that you have like 80%, 90% agreement, then this is a signal to you that maybe you're doing too much peer review, which is like a signal that would be absent if you didn't have this benchmark for how much we should be agreeing.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> That's interesting, because that's actually not the implication that I take.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I think I would correlate my opinion more with program officers at Open Philanthropy than peer review scores from external experts, would be my guess. Which means that the implication... the implication would not be right. Another downside of having such an autonomous system with &#8211; at the moment, the only real checkers being me, and in some cases, Emily Olsen and Alexander Berger at Open Philanthropy &#8211; is that you end up fitting too much to \"am <em>I</em> [points at self] going to give the stamp of 'I agree' or not?\" So you should do <em>less</em> peer review, you should spend <em>more</em> time with Jacob. So I worry about <em>that</em>. I don't worry about the peer review one.</p><p>We also hire people who are quite&#8230; who are not <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shrinking%20violet\">shrinking violets</a>. We're hiring people who <em>want to change the world</em>. They're going out there and they believe in stuff.</p><p>Are there other dynamic parts of the system you think could go wrong and how I've described it, though?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> People trying to please their boss is always a huge issue. But yeah, there is probably not that much you can do.</p><h2><strong>Is it possible to make expected value calculations for basic scientific research?</strong></h2><p>I think for me, like, my immediate thought here is it seems really hard, if not impossible, to do any kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\">expected value</a> calculations if you're funding science. And so you mentioned that &#8211; I think I'm just really confused about how this actually works.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Because like, I myself don't trust the calculations for things like <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/deworming\">deworming</a> or like <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/malaria\">malaria nets</a>, even. They seem like... Very, very fishy to me. But then if we're thinking science and basic science and &#8212;</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> It's interesting you chose those two examples, where people have looked at them more. I wonder if that's an availability reason you chose those two.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I mean, I saw the tables that GiveWell was providing for deworming impact estimates. And there is like, a hundred effects. And then, these are only short-term effects. And then, like, for malaria as well.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Deworming looks at long-term, but yeah, I agree with the point you're making. I'm just wondering if there's, the point you're making is downstream of it being very difficult to know anything about the world.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I mean, yeah, yeah, basically it is, but the point I'm making is that even for things that seem much simpler than assessing expected value of basic science, I'm still pretty skeptical about them.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Got it, got it. I'm with you.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> And then we get to basic science, and to me, it's like, well, I mean, this has got to be impossible to do here. And yet somehow&#8230;</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Like, how does that work?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> So, it gets way easier the closer things get to application to put rough quantifications on them. So, we're funding an efficacy trial of &#8211; we were just talking about TB vaccines. We're funding an efficacy trial of a TB vaccine in adults, and we can really constrain a bit better the probabilities of \"do we think that it will detect efficacy in a given range, given the design of the study, given previous trials in TB?\". We have a little bit of a base rate to go off of. If so, do we think that it would become a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI\">GAVI vaccine</a>? So, it would be GAVI-supported in lower-income countries? Do we think the Indian government would&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> But this is also, like, very applied, like, so...</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Totally, I'm going to look around.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> One of your grantees <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/baker/facts/\">just got Nobel</a>, right, in Chemistry: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Baker_(biochemist)\">David Baker</a>. And you were very proud of starting to fund him back in his lab, back in 2017.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Not me personally, my colleagues.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Your esteemed scientists &#8211; biochemists &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/chris-somerville/\">Chris Somerville</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/heather-youngs/\">Heather Youngs</a>, who I'm going to ask you about afterwards as well.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Oh, okay.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Also, sorry if I'm pushing too much on this, but, like, is there an Excel table somewhere in the annals of Open Philanthropy where Chris and Heather, like, calculated the expected value of giving a grant to David Baker and it came out to be larger than distributing malaria nets in Africa? Or was it just &#8211; he seems like a really brilliant person working on something very exciting, we should support him?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> We almost always... So, nowadays, well, I'm trying to figure out the way to answer this. We almost always will have a spreadsheet of some form.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Now, what weight we put on that spreadsheet, versus qualitative factors of other forms?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah, because I remember, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Karnofsky\">Holden</a> has <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/hits-based-giving/\">this blog post</a> that I keep returning to a lot where he talks about the expected value calculations and their weight in decision-making of when you're doing hits-based giving, right? And the inherent limitations in any kind of expected value calculations.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> The calculations are always an input. They're always a tool that we try and use. The benefits they hold... If you can make a believable one, is that you can try and set consistently budgets across cause areas that are very different.</p><p>So, for example, Open Philanthropy does not do all basic science. You know, we could give all the money away to basic science, but nowhere near that.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> And to do that, we would have to be persuaded of some quantitative reason to do it. I think it's actually quite hard to make the case that Open Philanthropy should do... I think we might do about 700 million of grant making this year. We should do 700 million in basic science, given the cases you can make for the, you know, global aid policy program we have. The cases you can make for lead reduction that's nothing to do with vaccines. You know, the cases you can make for factory farming is something that is a sort of current really messed up part of our society that you need to get rid of. So, you need some way to do a comparison between causes. The more quantitative you can make it, in my opinion, is great if the numbers reflect anything in reality. I think the further that you go back towards basic science with no intended application, the harder that gets.</p><p>You can rely on some things, though. You know, like, we exist within a context. And that context includes the existence of the NIH. That context includes the existence of <a href=\"https://www.hhmi.org/\">HHMI</a>. That context includes... The existence of, you know, the <a href=\"https://alleninstitute.org/\">Allen Institute</a>. So, it's not like that if Open Philanthropy doesn't exist, basic science won't exist. We're playing at a margin. And we can try and look at what are other actors doing and can we get any sense of how valuable that is in comparison. And I think you can make educated guesses about what a good basic science grant looks like from working backwards from potential applications. And this is a... You know, you've got to be careful. Because you never know what the true theory of change will end up being. But I think it's usually productive to have a theory of change. And, you know, if you look at &#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Right. Like, what you're saying is that you don't know how exactly the thing you're funding will end up being useful. But if you literally can't think of a way that it will be useful, then this fact is informative compared to whether you thought there's five different ways something might be useful.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yep, absolutely. And, you know, the reason we wouldn't fund something that's really stand out, that might be cross-cutting, is sometimes simply located in, well, would this get funded by the NIH?</p><p>And, you know, you mentioned David Baker and <a href=\"https://www.ipd.uw.edu/\">Institute of Protein Design</a>. They had... They... We are not the cause of David Baker being David Baker. You know, David Baker's been supported by&#8211; He's a rock star being supported by many people, by many funders, I mean. The grant that we made at that time came from... So this is maybe apocryphal, because I was not in the room. I'm going off of secondhand. But, you know, Chris and Heather seeing Baker present these ideas, assuming, since it's so cool, that he would get funded by conventional federal actors, coming back around later, he still haven't got the money. And it's like, what the heck? And engaging in more detail of, okay, what would it look like if we made a pretty large grant to the Institute for Protein Design? And I believe in that case, again, you should ask David Baker and <a href=\"https://www.ipd.uw.edu/people/neil-king/\">Neil King</a> as well &#8211; get them on the show &#8211; but my colleagues, Chris and Heather, were pitched a certain thing and said, \"that's a great thing.\" It was to do with flu vaccines and vaccinology, and sort of applying frontier techniques of protein design to that. But then asked, \"okay, wonderful, David, by the way, like, what do you really want to do? That think you can't get funded?\" And I believe David Baker was then like, \"well, actually, really, I want to do this methods development. So that I can sort of work on protein design at a fundamental &#8211;\" So deep learning wasn't quite the paradigm back then, probably. But, you know, various machine learning techniques to work on protein design. But, you know, he was &#8211; He didn't fit the box of &#8211; His background did not fit the box of NIH would give him $10 million or whatever. that... And then Chris and Heather were like, amazing, do both. Like, here's $6 million for that, $6 million for this. And, you know, that's not something that we do with every grantee, for sure. That's not our... But it's something that philanthropy can do. And the reason that looks so good, even quantitatively, relates to the fact that... That he couldn't get funded elsewhere.</p><p>And I get more nervous when we're just like, okay, look at this really hot shot person, give them loads of money, &#8211; this doesn't always counterfactually look that hot to me. Because the hot shot person often has access to lots of money. So you got to have a more specific story about, their background doesn't quite match what they want to do. Or, you know, their funders have not come to...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> If someone wants to get science funding from Open Philanthropy, it's easy for me to go and try to get funding from a bunch of other different places and get turned down by all of them.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I mean &#8211;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Because otherwise Open Philanthropy will ask you, \"well, why are you coming to us?\"</p><h2><strong>Non-profit funding vs for-profit funding</strong></h2><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> It's kind of a horrible aspect of nonprofit funding, that&#8211;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> That it's the exact opposite of if you start a startup and you try and raise money. If anyone hears on the grapevine, if you're a VC and you hear \"they're about to get funded,\" you're racing to try and get your money in.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughing] Yeah.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Because you're like, \"oh my God, there's no financing risk. Incredible.\" Whereas nonprofit dollars are so scarce, and when you care about counterfactuals, you can't&#8212; We don't care if our name is on something. We care about the impact. So it's a huge win. If someone else can fund something, it gives us more firepower to fund the next great thing we want to. But it is way worse from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_investigator\">PI</a>'s point of view and from an executive of a nonprofit's point of view. It's pretty... It's really... The dynamics are kind of messed up in that way.</p><h2><strong>Why the NIH rejects grants</strong></h2><p>My colleague, Matt Clancy, who works on innovation policy, sort of made a grant and set up a collaboration with the UK government on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metascience\">meta-science</a> grants, which they're now evaluating right now. And I think you can get benefits of having one pipeline, but multiple funders with different perspectives. And sure enough, with the NIH program, there's just a lot of stuff that... I mean, there are many familiar reasons why NIH grants get rejected that you or I or another funder might not agree with. And some of them are that a given scientist doesn't have enough experience in a given area. That's like a classic reason to get rejected. And I don't think that's a great reason in lots of cases. Another is that there's not initial data that shows that what they're trying to do will probably work, and it's basically too ambitious and too risky. Very common. And not the kind of thing that we would rule out a grant for. And in fact, some of our best grants look like that.</p><p>So if you can use existing grant pipelines and look at the work that people have put in to write those proposals, I think that can be a great thing to do. It can't get you all of the best grants. Because sometimes you have to... You know, scientists often are trained by the system to break up problems into NIH-fundable units. And if you talk to a professor and say, you actually don't have to work within that... And you really try and think together through, like, \"what could it look like if you worked on this?\" You can end up with quite a different grant proposal. So it's not a be-all, end-all. Just use the existing pipelines. But it's a pretty good start. And there's stuff... You know, if I was a new science funder sort of trying to get my feet wet, I think it's a great way to start. Because you see, well, before I try and revolutionize the system, what is the system currently doing? I need to sort of know that before I actually know what I'm doing. So you can get a more grounded sense of your disagreements with the system by doing it.</p><h2><strong>Jacob's \"PhD\" working side-by-side with two biochemists for 5 years</strong></h2><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> So what did you learn from <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/chris-somerville/\">Chris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/heather-youngs/\">Heather</a>?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I mean, it's... I don't know how to condense that into an answer. Because we've worked together for the length of a PhD for me. So I've had, you know, weekly meetings with them&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> But I guess there is maybe a little bit more context to make it somewhat easier. This person, like, doesn't have a science background, right, and they are scientists with long careers in biochemistry. You ended up, through the years, you went from not really knowing anything about scientific grant-making and not having a background in science to overseeing a big science portfolio. I wonder if there are some key mental things that you learned. Or is it... Or is it less that, and more you just spent years reading grant applications and talking to them? That is just the accumulation of all of this is what enables you to do your work now? Or...</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> The accumulation of talking to Chris and Heather for many years, it does enable me to do my work now. That's also true outside of some scientific perspective and talking to other people at Open Philanthropy, which is a kind of hub for thinking about effective philanthropy. So I don't want to short shrift other people, too. But about scientific grant making, yes. I mean, we've just gone over a hundred plus grants that have been made I know really well. And that's... I haven't made them. And I haven't been qualified to make most of those. But I've discussed them. I've tried to come up with objections to why we shouldn't do this. Try and do that all the time to be generative or to... Some... Occasionally it will be a useful input into changing direction of something or expanding a budget.</p><p>I think the sort of high-level things&#8212; I'm just reflecting now on what high-level things I've learned from Chris and Heather. I mean, one thing that's really... They have such a unique relationship with each other. And they disagree a lot. And that is very valuable to watch as someone coming from the outside, that you can have quite different perspectives, even with very similar shared information state. And that cuts against the sort of spreadsheet approach to things. You really can be right there in the trenches with each other and still disagree.</p><p>Now, I don't want to overstate that because we've tried to quantify the disagreement, of course. And so we've done exercises like, even if you can't say how good an expected value something would be, give an ordinal ranking of your grants. So in a given year, put your grants into buckets. Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4, Tier 5. And we've done exercises where I've done that for science grants. Chris has done that for science grants. Heather's done that for science grants. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/katharine-collins/\">Katherine</a>'s done that for science grants. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/ray-kennedy/\">Ray</a>'s done that for science grants. And... Sorry, for their own grants in those cases. I'm going to recall the numbers wrong. But the ranking between Chris and Heather is more correlated. It's fairly correlated. It's not random. They kind of agree at the end of the day on quite a lot. The standard deviation of tier is something like 0.6. I have to look back. I disagree a bit more, interestingly. But overall, don't disagree that much. And, you know, what is that sample? Well, that sample excludes anything that we didn't make a grant to. So there might be more disagreement located in the things that never get a tier. That's very possible.</p><p>But, yeah, it's great to see... I've seen a deliberative, reflective process play out every week in an hour and a half or hour-long meeting with agreement and convergence and diversion. That's probably been... I mean, that's been very fun, for one thing. And we &#8211; I mean, Chris and Heather, but other colleagues too &#8211; cover such a broad area. That's another really interesting part of what you can do as a philanthropist. I mean, you could as other financing entities. You could as a VC as well. But, you know, their background is not in biomedicine. They're biochemists. But that background means that they have a kind of generalism across lots of forms of basic research that would end up being relevant to vaccines, drug diagnostics, you know, vector control tools. But also, you know, medical papers, also structural biology, also this, that. The background is enough to get you in the door to then read all those papers. But... the generalism is quite deep in a sense. You know, there's a huge amount out there. And you can't be an expert in all of it. So if you are trying to be opportunistic, do the highest social value things, and, you know, jump at this gap here, this gap here, you almost necessarily have to be a scientific generalist. Yeah. I don't know if I answered your question.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [thinks]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Well, by the way, if you're going to pause, I'll say more. [Chuckles] That's the danger.</p><h2><strong>Today's system of federal funding are not supporting generalists</strong></h2><p>The systems of federal funding are really not set up for generalism. Usually &#8211; I mean, there's some cases you can pick &#8211; but, you know, peer review from your peers in your field is the absolute opposite of generalism. That's notable, when you're able to do organizational design from the ground up, that that is where you end up going is, I think, partly in reaction to the current system.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah... I have this crackpot, semi-crackpot thesis for a nonprofit or for a science grant-maker where the thesis of the org is zero peer review. Just take one person and they just decide whether to fund, like, science projects or not to fund. And that's it. And that's... And they're not allowed to seek external peer review. [laughs] It's a countermeasure. And they're probably going to end up funding a bunch of crackpots and a lot of things that don't make sense, but&#8212;</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I'm generally&#8212; one of the sort of, I don't know, almost like meta-level organizational design principles I'm quite a big fan of is &#8211; and I think that is inherited from <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/alexander-berger/\">Alexander</a>, the CEO of Open Philanthropy, who talked a lot about this &#8211; is flexibility. So the reason I don't like that is why ban someone? Don't ban someone. The reason to ban someone is if you need to jostle them out of the system they're otherwise going to get drawn into. But... Yeah. Just give people freedom. Give a peer freedom to... If they want to get external peer review, they can. And, you know, their manager might get mad at them if they make fewer grants because they're doing too much...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Well, I mean, the reason I'm thinking about that is because, again, I think I'm just thinking about, like, what happened to me. I never intended to be... Doing grants by committee. And that's what I somehow, like, found myself doing because I was just, like, too scared to...</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Did you have anyone in your life, a board member, who could say, Alexey, \"why are you doing this, why are you doing this?\" Because I think that's a nice role. You know, I have weekly one-on-ones. That's a nice role. If you have someone in your life saying, \"why are you doing this,\" then it can give you permission. That might be a cheaper way than banning. Why are you trying to ban yourself and stuff, Alexey? You just have, you know, a one-on-one every week. Yeah. Say, \"I found that I'm doing this.\" And then in your one-on-one, whoever you're talking to will say, like, \"why are you doing that?\" And then you'll say, \"because I'm scared.\" And then they'll be like, \"then don't do that.\" Problem solved. We did it in a week.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah. That has not been my experience.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Oh, really?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Fair enough.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Actually, I mean, this part probably should really not be included, but I think, like, when I'm thinking back on <a href=\"https://newscience.org/\">New Science</a> and, like, large parts of what went wrong is that I didn't really have Heather and Chris figures who I could just go and talk to about what I'm doing. Like, I just didn't have anyone to go to and figure out and talk to about what I was doing.</p><h2><strong>How will AI affect the pace of scientific progress?</strong></h2><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> AI FOMO?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> AI FOMO? I have the opposite. I think, if I know what you mean... I feel like every time someone tries to draw me into AI, I'm like, ooh.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Okay. So you have the opposite of AI FOMO?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I'm sure that's been true or false in different ways at different times. So I don't need to claim that's always been true. But...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> But at the moment?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I guess it's, like, especially in San Francisco, I feel like whenever I come to San Francisco, all of the people I know here, well, except for you, perhaps, are doing something related to AI. You know, there is a couple miles from here, there is Anthropic, another few miles away from here, there is OpenAI and &#8211; you know, the <a href=\"https://ia.samaltman.com/\">Intelligence Age</a> is almost upon us &#8211; all of these things, and so you're not... not drawn at all to, like, go and become a technical manager at Anthropic or at OpenAI or something like that? So feel free to... We can skip this question.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> No, no, no. It's all fair game.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I am not, as a descriptive fact, drawn by that.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> You don't want to be in the room where AGI is developed?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I... Not in that framing. No. That sounds horrible. I mean, that sounds... I think that urge that people have... I think that the urge that people have is often trying to meet a personal emotional need rather than a societal need. And I would love if people could meet that personal need through things that don't affect other people's lives quite so extravagantly. So I would see that &#8211; if I were following that urge, I would see that as maybe not the best way to make career decisions.</p><p>But, you know, I do think there's a lot of incredibly intellectually interesting things happening in all forms of alignment research and also developing new models and also biological foundation models and all this. There's many different frontiers that are being pushed incredibly rapidly. And that is something that I do think...</p><p>Well, you know, I haven't left San Francisco in a few months now. But the &#8211; I think San Francisco and the rest of the world, they're <em>really</em> in different head spaces, really <em>very</em> different head spaces about what the next five years are going to look like. And I'm sure that my social circle &#8211; I hang out with a lot of friends who work in AI or who have strong views one way or the other on different political problems with AI. So I'm sure I'm influenced by all of that in the way that I think about problems. And, you know, I do think in the case of medical progress, I've been thinking more recently about trying to...</p><p>Should we &#8211; you won't like this &#8211; I'm just going to go back to talking about my current job instead of \"should I leave and do whatever you want me to do?\" But how should we adapt our portfolio now in the context of potential changes to medical research that are driven by AI progress, and in the context of whenever we make a grant, the impact that actually happens from the grant is many years down the line. So you actually should be thinking ahead rather than thinking the most important thing this year is [gestures] <em>this</em>, so let's do <em>this</em>. You know, you actually have to backchain from years in the future. And I think that I probably do have different views about that that are informed by being in San Francisco than if I &#8211; you know, if we were a biomedical research grant-making organization based in...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> How does this affect your grant-making?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> So far, not much. And so I wonder, is that a mistake? But the thing that I often turn to is I think you can make educated guesses about...</p><p>Let me phrase it differently. Let's say that AI progress in a broad sense of language models, but also foundational biology models &#8211; but also this, that, and the other &#8211; continue to make progress <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/at-a-clip#:~:text=If%20something%20moves%20or%20happens,it%20moves%20or%20happens%20quickly.&amp;text=They%20moved%20out%20from%20the,movies%20at%20a%20fast%20clip.\">at a clip</a>. Biology and biomedicine as a science does indeed drive medical progress. So do you assume that medical progress will move forward at the same clip? And if not, why not?</p><p>I think one way to break down the question is, which parts of the system of medical research will become bottlenecks in a world that AI continues to progress really fast? I think you can make educated guesses, certainly at the five year level about that and maybe the 10-year level about that. I can give you my guesses, but I think basically the inference is that those are, if you care about the societal impact of whatever you're trying to make in biomedicine, you should relatively speaking focus more on those bottlenecks potentially, rather than just diving into the hot AI stuff that everyone's sort of already pushing ahead really fast.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Right... So, what are those things?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Well, I'm of course not sure. I don't know. But my educated guesses are that&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Because I've been, I mean &#8211; this is also for me, very interesting, right? Because I spent a lot of time thinking about biology, a lot of time thinking about AI, and I am &#8211; I'm not even sure... how exactly will the kind of science being done change?</p><p>Because in a way we have already &#8211; especially in biology &#8211; we went through this really dramatic transformation where people would spend their entire PhD sequencing a single gene, and now we can sequence an entire genome for a few hundred dollars. In a lot of ways, the biomedical research productivity has already gone, like, just thousands, millions of times over.</p><p>In a way everything changed about the way we do biology, but also nothing really changed, and I feel like I'm personally very confused about this and we'll just, like, see the same thing &#8211; everything will change in 10 years, but also, kind of, nothing will really change and...</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I have the urge to get a bit more specific about what changed and what didn't because I don't think that all fields of biology changed at the same rate, and it depends what productivity means because I agree with you that over the course of one generation of a scientist's life &#8211; let's take it back to Chris and Heather.</p><p>Chris Somerville, my colleague, was one of the main guys behind <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana#Use_as_a_model_organism\">Arabidopsis</a> and, you know, the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/35048692\">senior author on the main paper</a>, this was a lot of his career of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana#Use_as_a_model_organism\">the model plant organism</a> that gets used a lot. The first time they sequenced the genome of Arabidopsis, it costs &#8211; I think they had like a $100 million grant. So in a way, maybe it costs that. I don't know literally how you'd attribute the sequencing. I don't know how much you got, but, like &#8211; an absurd amount of money.</p><p>And now you can sequence Arabidopsis for, say, $100, probably less, probably way less, I don't know. But you're talking about real orders of magnitude. The question for me then on, and so it must be absolutely just such a trippy experience for him of, you know, it wasn't that long ago we did the first, like, that was 25 years ago, like, not long.</p><p>Similarly, with, more recently protein folding, you used to maybe spend a whole PhD trying to work on one protein, and now you can at least take <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction\">sequence to structure</a> and do really well very quickly. Yeah. Or you can't necessarily&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah, like validate things in a few weeks, right?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Also, we went from, whatever, like, 200 weeks to 2 weeks, something like that.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Depends specifically on&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Okay, sorry, I don't know enough biology, but also more than an order of magnitude.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Right, I agree. We're not there on lots of things. You know, that's proteins, and that was built off the protein databank. Are we there for carbohydrates? Are we there for lipids? I haven't seen it. And are we there for protein <em>function</em>? Well, not yet, no. Function's harder to define than structure. Like, in some contexts, a protein acts <em>this</em> way, and in some contexts, it acts <em>that</em> way. Function's kind of what we care about. There's a long way still to go.</p><p>When we talk about productivity improvements, you can point to these things that have three orders of magnitude differences. The thing that I always try and backchain from in my seat now &#8211; I'm not saying this is the only reason to do science &#8211; but in my seat right now, that I care about science for health impact, for people, starting from the premise of everyone matters equally, and everyone's life matters equally. I care about productivity that's harder to benchmark. I'm like, \"show me the new life-saving drugs at the end of a pipeline\", and that's a really lagging indicator. It's a cruel one in a way, but I'm extremely confident that we don't have a 1000x improvement in approval of life-saving drugs.</p><p>You're looking more at the level, okay, what does someone actually do now? What does this structural biologist do now, versus what they did five years ago? Like, what are they actually doing day to day? And are they producing discoveries of similar magnitude, different magnitude? It gets a bit more complicated. I don't think that AI will sweep through as quickly.</p><p>If you talk to biologists about this, then the classic thing that I'm sure you've heard all the time is like, well, \"Guess what? Alpha Folder is built on $10 billion of previous data collection in the protein data bank.\" So, you're looking around, you're like, \"where do I have a really high quality data set that could get a similar kind of AI-driven, sudden improvement.\" And everyone's doing that now.<br /><br />But then there's an even deeper question, which people in San Francisco talk about &#8211; which hasn't probably [laughs] made it very far beyond San Francisco yet &#8211; which is more around synthetic data or more around designing reasoning agents or scientists that you can then instantiate in a virtual university with a million of them, where they debate and publish papers and all that stuff. So <em>that</em>, um, I don't feel able to make good predictions about that world, because I don't think we've even got anywhere near that, but I think in the next few years, probably we could well do.</p><p>I feel like we can, you know, like here's one thing that I think will be a block in five years, uh, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy\">good targets</a>. Like, we've got really good at designing something that binds to a target, but everyone's going off to the same targets in cancer. There aren't that many known validated good targets, so you can chuck as much money as you want, but if you don't understand how the system works... Similarly, take a brain disease &#8211; Alzheimer's &#8211; we have such poor measurement of what's going on in the brain that, do I think we're really going to get good targets in the next five or 10 years, even with magical AI from the sky? Well, no, because no one's going to open up their brain and be able to take the relevant measurements probably.</p><p>I can tell the story the other way, if you want me to, but I've rambled for a while... that's &#8211; [smiles] ah, I'll do it.</p><p>The story the other way is that, \"<em>oh</em>, you <em>don't</em> need high quality data.\" It turns out that if you have a genius from the sky, you can actually learn so much from YouTube videos and learn about how physics works. You can have perfect laws of physics. And then when you have perfect laws of physics and you've just <em>only</em> read PubMed or <em>only</em> ingested such and such dataset of human biology, you can figure out what's probably going on up there, even if you never take any measurements and therefore you can make a perfect Alzheimer's drug. I can't refute that. It's possible that you can have wonderful simulations with our current level of data and you don't need to collect much more. That's not where I would currently place my bets. So I don't think we will have a great cure for Alzheimer's, even with magical AI before it goes through other real world data collection. But I could, I mean &#8211; what do you think about that?</p><h2><strong>AI Baumol Disease</strong></h2><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I think I agree with you pretty much on all of this. I think one... I guess I think about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol_effect\">Baumol's disease</a> and indeed, AI will make sub-problems of problems we care about dramatically easier to do. Like, we care about [gestures] human health and for that we need, say, drugs. And part of getting a drug that works is predicting protein structure at some point to help with &#8211; I don't know enough details &#8211; but it's like part of a bigger problem. And there is like 20 sub-problems, and AI, maybe for five of them, AI will just make them free, essentially, but then you're still left with 15 problems, which probably cannot really be sped up, and that end up just occupying the rest of the time. So I do wonder whether there is some kind of an upper bound on how much AI can speed things up, because I know even at the end of the diseases just progress at a certain rate.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Totally, totally.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> And there is this rationalist and empiricist frame, and rationalists say, \"yeah, we can just think very hard, predict,\" and I think I'm just like, especially for complicated systems, now, you need to actually go and do the experiment. Until you run the experiment, you just genuinely don't know.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> This makes me very sad, because it's...</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> It doesn't make you happy? We have so much to learn.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Uh, it makes it&#8212;</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> We're alive way before the beginning of biology.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I mean, this makes me worried. I think I used to...</p><p>I kind of bounced around from thinking that &#8211; I mean, the original thesis behind New Science, in a lot of ways, was \"AGI is not near.\" And everything will take decades. We need to really figure out how to make sure that science works well, that basic institutions of science are well functioning for the decades ahead.</p><p>Then I, like, went through a phase where like, oh wait, yeah it [AI] will change everything in the next few years, so none of this basic stuff of science and institution stuff makes sense, and now I'm back to this point of \"oh, shit the world is going really slow.\" And like, yeah, AI <em>will</em> be strong, but like, it won't change the world. Again, every &#8211; in some ways, everything will change for some problems for which AI is really good at, and for other things, nothing will change.</p><p>This makes me very... I mean, this is why I'm thinking about institutions of science again, right? [laughs] because I'm like, \"oh, wait, we need to plan for decades ahead and make sure that science works well decades ahead\" and that all these, like, Alzheimer's &#8211; indeed my impressions are that we just we don't really understand, like, biology. We don't really know how to measure things. The brain is still &#8211; it's just like I'm... I feel mortality very acutely now, again.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I mean, literally, you know, if I don't expect singularity or anything like that happening anytime soon, and if I really think that at the end of the day, you need to run clinical trials for things you really care about and they take <em>years</em>, then you don't really have that many shots on the goal. We have 50 years, 60 years? How much can you do in 50, 60 years?</p><p>[laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Well, I mean, the...</p><p>[stands up and grabs <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Her_2/sk8sAAAAYAAJ?hl=en\">Her-2:</a></em></p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Her_2/sk8sAAAAYAAJ?hl=en\">The Making of Herceptin, a Revolutionary Treatment for Breast Cancer</a></em>]</p><p>I haven't read this book, but I think it's gonna cheer you up.</p><p>[tosses the book to Alexey]</p><p>Here's my gift to you. I just bought it for me, but you can have it.</p><p>So I think, oh, no... am I thinking of the right, is that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib\">Imatinib</a>? Which is that?</p><p>Yeah, I don't think that [Imatinib] had a phase three trial. I think it was so good in the phase two &#8211; but someone will correct me in the comments &#8211; so it was so good in the phase two, that they just approved it. It would be unethical not to.</p><p>And so the happy world for you would be, we have such magical AI systems that an AI system predicts, \"by the way, if you run this in a clinical trial, then there's a 84% chance it will hit endpoint <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/for_XYZ_reasons\">XYZ</a> in 10 years, and we're highly confident it's not gonna cause neuroinflammation and it's not gonna harm your brain <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/for_XYZ_reasons\">for XYZ reasons</a>.\" And then maybe you'll be happy taking it to slow down progression of Alzheimer's. Now, there's a whole other set of questions of, will the policy world adapt to that and in what ways? I think in the case of prevention, you probably will be slower. In the case of treating people who will die of a disease, I think the policy response may be quite quick of \"okay, this AI system spat out a prediction that it's probably gonna work. Do you wanna be in the trial where you might be in the control or just take it?\" I think people would be like, \"okay.\"</p><p>Anyway, there's my optimistic case. That said, I'm actually more in your...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> What do I currently believe? Yeah, I think some things still take &#8211; you know, Alzheimer's, if you're taking a daily drug to prevent progression of it, which no one is basically currently, but if we had a future drug &#8211; that totally could have safety problems, you know? So do you want to take it before you've seen, how someone in a clinical trial did after five years, after 10 years? I'm like, not sure. It's sort of pretty slow moving disease. So we might just have to wait for that trial. And it's, that takes time. I think the thing I, if I would cheer you up in a different direction, it's that, the&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs] I like how this interview started from me asking you about your work at Open Philanthropy into you just cheering me up, so I would continue to pray for the future.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [laughs] Well, I, uh...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughing] Please continue, I appreciate it.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Of course, one of the, um&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs] I hope you're doing this for free...</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [smiles] Oh, I assume I'm getting paid for this interview. No, one of the, you know, I was saying earlier about how it's frustrating that there are so few good targets to go after and everyone goes after the same ones. Well, the analog, the <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/disanalogy#:~:text=A%20lack%20or%20failure%20of%20analogy.\">disanalog</a> of that in the case of products that help people in lower and middle income country settings, but not so much in high income country settings, is that there are plenty of probably good targets that haven't been explored that much. And, you know, if you're... it's way easier to study a bacteria in a lab and to learn a lot about it as well than to study a human system. You might be able to find quite a lot out about that bacteria, and have quite a few potential antigens that you could go after with a vaccine, for example.</p><p>If I may squeeze in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_A_streptococcal_infection\">Strep A</a> into this interview, because any time I'm allowed to, I will. Strep A is a bacteria that you've probably been infected with many times. I have been. It causes strep throat. Do you remember the last time you got strep throat?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I used to get strep throat a lot.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> It's very annoying, so mostly it's annoying but sometimes it&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I actually was in the hospital twice when I was younger for it.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Totally, yeah, it can &#8211; it's real... kids end up in hospitals somewhat frequently for it, and can get an invasive disease where the strep bacteria <a href=\"https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/streptococcal/group_a/fact_sheet.htm\">spreads around your body</a>, and it can cause lots of problems, and it can cause many deaths, actually, in toddlers.</p><p>In addition, in lots of countries, if you get infected many times, there's an autoimmunity, there's a molecular mimicry issue. Your body's trying to attack the pathogen, but actually ends up attacking your heart valves. So you can get acute rheumatic fever or long-term rheumatic heart disease, which leads to early cardiac problems and death. And if you add up all the problems that strep A causes downstream, the best estimate &#8211; which isn't a great one &#8211; the best estimate that we've got is that it leads to about <a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/69063/WHO_FCH_CAH_05.07.pdf#page=6\">half a million people dying every year</a>.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Oh.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> And you know, when we loop back around to can you even make any comparison between basic science of [gestures] <em>this</em> form or <em>this</em> form? And how will you know what's better than the other? Well, you can look at neglectedness as a pretty good lens and very few people are working on strep A, very, very few.</p><p>If you look at the total amount of R&amp;D funding dedicated to trying to make a vaccine, for example, or include if you want some more microbiology and basic stuff, and epidemiology of where's rheumatic heart disease happening? The <a href=\"https://blog.jacobtrefethen.com/strep/\">best estimate</a> I've managed to pull together is that there's maybe $1 or $2 of R&amp;D funding per year of life lost due to infections globally, okay? So you shouldn't have an intuition for what that means, but you're gonna get a comparative one in a second, which is that for cancers, it's probably about two orders of magnitude higher. So more like $200.</p><p>So that doesn't tell you anything immediately because maybe it's impossible to work on strep A, and so there shouldn't be any money spent on it, but I'll give you a hint. It's not impossible to work on strep A! There's quite a lot you could do. And if there were more scientists really laser focused on the problem, you know, there's loads of unanswered questions at the level of what makes a good antigen. There are maybe <a href=\"https://blog.jacobtrefethen.com/strep/\">seven leading hypotheses</a>.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> This is so weird.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [nodding] It's very weird, very weird.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> How come?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> There's a couple drivers. I mean, the deaths are mostly happening in lower middle income countries. So not exclusively though, invasive disease can get you anywhere.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> That's a big driver. So another reason is the FDA banned trials for 30, 40 years, and that <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2005/12/02/05-23546/revocation-of-status-of-specific-products-group-a-streptococcus\">ban got lifted in 2006</a>, I think. So that sort of meant that it was hard to build a career in the field or lots of vaccine companies don't have programs where they've looked at.</p><p>Then in addition, because of the auto-immunity issue, you want to be sure that you're not creating problems with a vaccine. With modern tools, I think you can be pretty sure you're not, but there's a question of what data package will I have to get to prove that there are no safety issues?</p><p>Then there's a question for vaccine developers of efficacy. It's pretty easy to run a trial against pharyngitis strep throat, because people get that all the time. You and I are at risk of getting that in the next year, so <em>we</em> could enroll in a trial, let alone kids who get it all the time. So you only need maybe a thousand people to run a good trial with that, but if you care about preventing rheumatic heart disease, if you care about preventing necrotizing fasciitis&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah, that takes so long.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Proving the link is, you know, in a trial, very difficult because the incidence is too low. You won't accrue enough cases of necrotizing fasciitis where it's in your legs and eating your flesh and every hour it moves another inch kind of thing because it's rare enough.</p><h2><strong>Can AI speed up aging research?</strong></h2><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> So I should be pessimistic about the future again?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> No, you should be optimistic because- well, sorry, sorry, you should be pessimistic unless you want to get involved in the fight against strep A.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I think if you and your viewers got involved, we could really take a swing at it because you could test a bunch of vaccines for sure, you definitely could.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Unfortunately most of our viewers work on things like biosecurity and monitoring, things like that. Instead of taking real problems.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Oohhhfff, you're insulting your viewers? Wowww, wow. That's interesting. Interesting. Those are real prob&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> No pandering to viewers.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [laughs] Any other swings you want to get in at them? What else are they working on?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs] All kind of stupid shit.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I mean, basically what's the limitation on this problem? There's scientific limitations, human capital limitations and money limitations.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah. No, but it is striking to me &#8211; but like the thing that I keep returning to is these things that I do not see a way of speeding up. Like at the end of the day, will we be able to use AI to predict that, or shorten the length of clinical trials from 10 years or 20 years to down to a year?</p><p>This makes me think that maybe we'll solve, in some basic way, aging, but we'll solve it before all of these diseases. Like we'll understand how the body falls apart, but not...</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> So, I don't think we will solve aging before we solve strep A. I think that...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Also, sorry, sorry, but since I asked you about this, an immediate follow up is &#8211; since you mentioned that health impact is what you really care about at Open Philanthropy&#8212;</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Are you guys then trying to solve aging?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> We have given grants many years ago to <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/university-of-california-berkeley-aging-research-irina-conboy-2023/\">Irina Conboy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/university-of-california-los-angeles-epigenetic-clock-research-steve-horvath/\">Steve Horvath</a>. We've tilted out of that grant-making for neglectedness reasons. There are now lots of companies popping up funded by wealthy people trying to work on aging, so the neglectedness of the field looks way less.</p><p>In fact, a lot of the &#8211; you know, what do we have? Money. What can we do? Give people money. That's sort of our job. A lot of the money flowing into the field is now bottlenecked on people, that it's just pumping out salaries as far as I can tell. So for aging right now, we've pulled back. But we've done some in the past, yeah. It's interesting that as a sector [aging] is so company focused relative to other sectors, nowadays, but I think that's for various sociological reasons.</p><p>What is aging? Infectious disease is a part of aging. Inflammation is a part of aging. Heart disease kills however many people, and if you could solve heart disease, you'd solve aging in some way. There's these pendulums that swing in discourse of like, broader society is often focused on specific diseases, and people rightly, 5 or 7 years ago, were like \"hold on, in the case of aging, are there cross-cutting functions and cross-cutting drivers that if you could solve those would help with all sorts of diseases?\". I think that's a really valuable lens shift. Sometimes, I wonder if we've gone too far in that direction now, of like, well actually you <em>could</em> cure cancer and you <em>could</em> cure heart diseases. That'd be pretty cool. So, I'm not sure at the margin, where I'd go there.</p><p>I expect that the stuff we're funding because it's so much more neglected, if we weren't giving support to those scientists, then they're not getting money elsewhere. So, that makes the case much easier from an impact point of view.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> You don't want to make a strep A vaccine together? I think we could bash that one out. I think we could do that, I mean, not you and me &#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [feigning disappointment] oh</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> But we could help scientists who are doing that.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I thought we'd... [looks down]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Okay fiiiiine, you and me.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> You twist my arm. We can work on strep A. You know, I didn't want to work on strep A until this interview, but if you're going to keep pushing me like this.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I mean you keep bringing it up. Every time you talk to someone, you keep talking strep A, you know&#8212;</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I'm a real freak like that.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Maybe it's time to put your money where your mouth is.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yeah.</p><h2><strong>The wisest people Jacob &amp; Alexey know</strong></h2><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Who's the wisest person you know?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Oh, my gosh. Who I know?</p><p>I don't know. Maybe &#8211; can I give boring answers? Probably, like, my friend Sarah back at home. And my mom. I don't know.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughing] Wonderful. Tell us about Sarah. That&#8217;s such a fun answer.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I haven't discussed before this interview if she would be...</p><p>I don't know. I just feel like when you, what is wisdom? I feel like I'm often seeking a &#8211; what would someone with good character do in situations that I'm in? And sometimes I think of Sarah.</p><p>But what is wisdom? Let's see. There are many people who I either know or have a more parasocial relationship with that I view them as bringing out the best in me, but I don't know if that's always wisdom. Well, which lane do you want me to pick? People I don't know or who I do kno?

As you know, we sort of hang out in circles that talk about changing scientific institutions and that are trying to be more ambitious and different with how science is done. And they are really living it. They are living it. They've created a whole new institution that is iterating like crazy on doing experiments and how should you rethink publishing, and how should you, uh, rethink <em>stopping</em> investigating something? Like at what stage do you stop? Because of the opportunity costs, you know, you shouldn't investigate everything forever. When you do stop, what can you publish so other people can know? They&#8217;re actually living a lot of what I sort of think about.

He is like at the top, just like consistently somehow tells me things that I think I should have thought about before. And then I ignore him. And then a few years later, I'm like, oh wait, Tyler told me about this a few years before.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> It's a good way.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah, I noticed that whenever I think about things that are very difficult, I ask myself &#8220;how would Tyler think about this?&#8221; more often than for any other person. He&#8217;s kind of a scary person. He's too wise.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [laughs] Good thing to aim for, I suppose.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> So how will science be different in the 21st century?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Too big, too big.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Role of academia?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Role of academia?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> You mentioned that for aging, for example, for sociological reasons, it's a problem that often for-profit companies are funded by people who really care about the problem directly affecting them, perhaps.

And Tyler Cowen once said that it seems that young people are getting accelerated actually, because the internet just allows people to learn much more, to get up to speed a lot more.</p><p>Tyler pointed out an example of chess where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen\">Magnus</a> was pretty young when he became world champion and the person who Tyler expects to be the new world champion is like 17 or something crazy like that. And so the top performance keeps getting younger.</p><p>I was recently talking to a professor of physics at MIT and was asking him about the preparedness for research of undergrads and grad students these days. And he told me the same thing that because of the internet sometimes the best undergrads are better prepared today than like 10 or 20 years ago. So in my head, there is this thing about on one hand, it seems that naturally young people are getting accelerated and like they should be getting more funding and more support and like, should be getting up to speed faster. And like in software, obviously. Or, like even you [Jacob], you are now, whatever, like 30 or so. Maybe you look younger [laughs], but you're now running this big thing at Open Philanthropy, right? And on the other hand, it seems that academia is not reacting to that at all. In fact, it's like the professors are getting older and then there is this AI thing and I think it also pulls away the most talented.</p><p>For example, a bunch of the most talented grad students I know in biology who I would have expected them to go and become professors and they all &#8211; well, not all, but the most talented ones, a bunch of them &#8211; just started biotech companies immediately after graduating PhD, even though I would have been sure they're the kind of people who I think would like, for them, the perfect career path would be to become a professor around the lab.</p><p>And so I have all of these things in my head and I am famously a person who likes to criticize academia a lot, but I do wonder if there is going to be some kind of a trend where more and more research on the basic one will just be done by other sources, maybe it's going to be, you know, Tyler funds the 20-year-old and Open Philanthropy funds the person when they're 23 and then they're just now running their own lab doing whatever it is that they want to do, sidestepping the entire system. And then with the help of AI also like one of the things that I feel like AI will do is just amplify the top performers. Like in biology, if you don't need to... if the experiments are done by robots, intellectually intensive work is going to be more and more outsourced and individuals get more leverage as well. And so there is, I feel like this aspect. Anyway, sort of been rambling.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> There's a lot of different parts of this picture, I think. Maybe a place to start is just me personally, and that's what I know best is my own life. And, you know, I view biology as one of the consolations of aging. There&#8217;s an unlimited nexus of different things you could know about cell biology, about different organs and diseases and all that, so that every year it feels better and better. It's so wonderful. The accumulation of knowledge. And I know so little, but next year I know a little more and then I know a little more. And that's sort of, you know, as I realize I will get older, that's been a nice field to go into because I think biology does actually sort of inherently, no, inherent isn't right, but it does reward accumulation of knowledge and connections rather than just raw &#8220;think my way through a problem&#8221; talent. So I think I dispute some of the premise in that I think some forms or some fields will have top performers of different ages. And then within any given field, you will get heterogeneity anyway. I totally agree with the punchline for what it's worth though, of even within biology, I don't think even the NIH wants the &#8211; who is the NIH? &#8211; But I think a lot of people at NIH probably feel quite awkward about how high the median age is of PI's getting grants.</p><p>And I mean, I view that as one of the big contributions of the work you've done, also of the ARC Institute, also of the meta-science community that's been building over the last few years as a kind of a broad group of people interested in trying to make science go better. Is this just highlighting this fact more and is the solution to that fact that you build more institutions that empower younger people sooner? Is the solution that you try and reform the NIH? Or is it somewhere in the middle? Like the Art Institute are put sort of in the middle of they're working with the existing universities in the area, Stanford and UCSF, and they work with Berkeley as well, I can't remember, but they're empowering certain people with much more resources and much sooner than you would. And that's great. So that's definitely a direction I agree with &#8211; sold, that should change. I don't know how it breaks down into what I would change.</p><p>Then... now I'm wondering what other parts of the question to pick up on. What will happen to academia broadly?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Okay. Proportion of revolutionary basic science done within like... Universities versus outside universities.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> As I think through, well, what do I really believe about that question and what drives it? One thing that is coming to mind is how many of the discoveries of the future will come from big science or big collaborative efforts, like the Human Genome Project, like AlphaFold requiring so much of an institution to... be behind it and the compute and all of that, like telescopes. Pick your examples that are kind of big, big collaboration versus the discoveries that <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2024/summary/\">just won the Medicine Nobel Prize this year</a>. I don't know that story well, and I'm curious if you do actually, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA\">microRNAs</a> &#8211; that was basically, you know, you can discover that in the 90s in a lab and that's kind of what they won it for. As I think through the big discoveries, <em>the</em> big discoveries... As I think through some discoveries from the last 30 years, a lot of the blockbuster ones do seem to have come from more of these big collaborations.</p><p>You could view the <a href=\"https://www.bakerlab.org/\">Baker Lab</a> that way, even though it's one lab. You know, the Institute of Project Design has tens &#8211; or maybe a hundred now &#8211; of students and just a couple of professors, but a lot of those students end up getting faculty positions. They've been trained on their <a href=\"https://docs.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/application_documentation/tools/Tools\">Rosetta tools</a>. They end up using them in their new position, feedback in and build a tool. So how do you count that in terms of size?</p><p>I do think that purposefully set up organizations with, you know, more regular managerial structures than academia can outperform on some of those big problems. I mean, it's happening right now in fusion. Who's going to end up adding the most value, these new fusion companies or the big government funded projects or national labs? I don't know the answer to that. But I really... I wouldn't be surprised if, frankly, because of wealth accumulation due to tech as well, it was like there's some really rich people now. They can do that, you know, projects they want to do in a private company because we support property rights in America. So where does that wealth go is almost going to drive some of the answer rather than the more bottom up scientist led answers to the question, probably.</p><h2><strong>The future of science in academia</strong></h2><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Do you have hope for academia? And if so, what kind of hope?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I have hope for undergrad part of universities. I think people, especially in Silicon Valley, underappreciate the value of a college degree funnily enough. But it's mostly because of the exposure. It's like a very nice track to be on where you can just like meet a lot of people, explore a lot of different things, talk to and meet a lot of professors, meet people your age, take any class you want. Socialize, have fun. But in terms of academia afterwards, I am... I mean I feel like I'm professionally obligated to say no in some way because I'm literally working on building new institutions of basic science.</p><p>But in a way there is... The way I think about academia now is that it's like... Professional science. I think academia has always been really good at professional science and paradigmatic science. And it's probably going to remain actually pretty good at this kind of thing, whereas I'm personally just more interested in pre-paradigmatic research and generalists doing things like... Uh, I know it seems that like, this is kind of a stupid example, but like Darwin, right? Like he spent whatever, a couple of decades writing his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species\">Origin of Species</a> and probably would not do well at all in academia and I think all of the researchers that I'm most interested in somehow don't quite fit in. They can't get funding. They are just too weird for academia. They work on things that are too long term, too poorly defined&#8212;</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Is that right? Don't you like lots of... I think of the people you've told me you love before, some of them are doing pretty well in academia. I don't know if you want me to out them on the podcast.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Well, we can, we can always cut things out.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Ed Boyden is doing pretty well.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> That's the most ridiculous example you could have come up with. Because Ed Boyden, the only reason he's still in academia is because of you guys, because he was about to close down his fucking lab at MIT and then you came in, Open Philanthropy and gave him a huge grant and now he's doing well and he recovered and didn't NIH literally reject him like nine times in a row. Like I remember he said that in some of his interviews that his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_microscopy\">expansion microscopy</a>, now one of the most successful projects coming out of his lab, was literally rejected nine times before it got funded. By who? [motions at Jacob]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Open Philanthropy. I think that's a great example.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> It's interesting that that's your narrative on it. Not that I had anything to do with that decision. So when we made the original grant to him, I wasn't there, but of course I'm willing to take the praise if you want to give it. It would be super interesting to ask him what he thinks would have happened to his career in the absence of that grant.</p><p>So I think what would have happened to expansion microscopy is a different question. I mean, expansion microscopy is crazy. I cannot believe how big that's gone. Like jeez, I can't believe it worked and it's gone <em>so</em> big. It's like, <em>what?</em> So yeah, that's one of those where you're if you make one of those grants, you can just pack it up and retire kind of.</p><p>But I wonder, I mean, he's so talented that in other ways that wouldn&#8217;t he have found something great to do with that? I don't know. Anyway, you know him better than I have, I've met him once in my life, so I don't know.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> No, I think that's actually a very good question to explore. Like what, what would he have done? I do think academia is doing... like, he&#8217;s restricted as a result.</p><p>I mean &#8211; I actually &#8211; I remember like I used to lobby Open Philanthropy&#8212;</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> You once sent me an email saying you need to give Ed Boyden a hundred million dollars. And I said, thank you so much. Or maybe I ghosted you. I probably ghosted you.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I think I was sending this email to Holden, to you, to anyone at Open Philanthropy I had an email for. And you guys never did.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Not yet, not yet.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah. And I think it would have been better for the world if Ed Boyden had a hundred million grant to start his own thing instead of being in academia.</p><p>I think a lot about the fact that he still lives within that system. Where he has to like constantly churn out papers, constantly apply for grants. He's constrained by the fact that he has students who are with him for five years. I would really love to see if Ed Boyden just had like 20 years of funding for an institute. Like, what would have happened? And I suspect that something way more interesting would have happened.</p><h2><strong>How Open Philanthropy uses neglectedness to make funding trade-offs</strong></h2><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> When you talk about duration of funding and flexibility of funding, to a funder, what looms large are the trade-offs.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah. Trade-offs, of course.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Unfortunately. Yeah.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I'm an Internet writer who just pesters people and sends them emails telling them to fund this and that. And you're the person who has constraints, who needs to make decisions, who faces trade-offs, the famous economics thing that sometimes features in our life.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Here's an example of a trade-off. If you give someone a four-year grant versus a 20-year grant, that's five times less money. Example: The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Biobank\">UK biobank</a> is so useful already, and we know it's going to get more useful over time as it accumulates more data. Does that mean that you should just endow it? Just give it as much money as an institution that can continue for decades, and don't faff around with all these grants that they have to write. And that's an argument that actually I find a bit more persuasive than pick your favorite scientists in 2024, give them 20 years of funding. Although I'm curious, how many scientists in the world would you think of the 20-year thing? Because, you know, for example, <a href=\"https://www.hhmi.org/\">HHMI</a>, how many investigators are there? I'm not sure, actually. But there's quite a few. You know, it's... It's a very limited set of science, but it's probably...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Three thousand?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yeah. Well, hundreds of thousands, say. And that's... Okay. So that's already a lot. Would you halve it and double the period? Would you double it and halve the period? Or are you talking about there are five Ed Boydens in the world, and it ain't about the 500? Oh, okay. Interesting. So list them. Who&#8217;re your faves?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Do you have anyone except Ed Boyden? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levin_(biologist)\">Michael Levin</a>, perhaps. <a href=\"https://as.tufts.edu/biology/people/faculty/michael-levin\">Tufts</a>.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> What would the annual size of your 20-year grant be?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> For Boyden, yeah, probably between 50 and 100 million... a year.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> That's beautiful. Thank you. That's really...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> That's like 20% of your endowment, right? Something like that.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yeah. But hey, it's a pitch. How would that get spent? So let's divide it out. How much is a postdoc's salary? How many people are in this lab?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah, that seems...</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I just think you get management constraints in labs. Like, you know, you...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> No, that seems too much. How many people can he... Actually, that probably... No, that's...</p><p>Probably closer to the order of $10 million per year. I think if it were more than that it&#8217;s not just a Boyden thing.</p><p>[laughs]</p><p>We'll see if I'm brave enough to leave this in.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Hopefully no one who is considering giving money to my non-profit is watching.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> If I were you, the productive line of inquiry, I would sort of advocate for myself is to just really scrutinize the trade-offs more. Because you can do a lot of damage with $1 million. You can really fund work that won't happen without it. And that work can be towards a goal that you think might...</p><p>In our case, we work on biomedical science. So towards a goal that you think might prevent tens of thousands of deaths a year, maybe hundreds of thousands of deaths. And the trade-offs get very acute when you're facing down the barrel of do we fund this marginal Malaria monoclonal antibody project?</p><p>We just funded <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/malaria-research-and-training-center-tb31f-clinical-trial/\">Alassane Dicko</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali\">Mali</a> to do a phase one to a trial that's basically never been done before, of a potentially transmission-blocking antibody that you could give maybe in combination with something that would have personal protection, too. And, oh my gosh, if that worked, just imagine. Right now, there's <a href=\"https://www.pmi.gov/what-we-do/seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention/\">seasonal malaria chemoprevention</a> that kids in many West African countries will get, which is taking preventive drugs that you swallow, you know, a few times, four months in a row. Kids hate the drugs. You find them in the trash. You know, like, not everyone finishes the regimen, all that. And they're not perfect. Even if you finish the regimen, imagine if you had one fucking &#8212; oh, sorry &#8212; one injection that protected you for a whole season, because you had a really good monoclonal and it involved a transmission-blocking component that reduced malaria spread to other people because there's fewer parasites in your body for every other reason. Then, oh my God, and guess what? That did not cost $10 million a year for 10 years. So the tradeoffs in science can be so intense because that's a great project. I'm very glad we funded it. And there's lots of other... That's not the only amazing project. There's many other ones, too. Some of them are in Mali, and some of them are in Thailand, and some of them, you know, they're not all at MIT. So, you know, if you're...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I think about this just... I'm just so much more interested in basic science and methods development. It just seems... Whenever I think about funding things, I always want to fund methods development, essentially. And so this is why I'm so excited about Boyden, for example.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Okay, let me sell you another one, that maybe we can meet in the middle on&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Again, I'm, like, I'm thinking about, like, the reason I'm, like...</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> So do you mean, like, tools as well? Like, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfluidics\">microfluidic chips</a>, do they get you going?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Maybe. I don't think I... After I said this $100 million a year thing, now I'm very worried about saying anything because that is very stupid.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> No, that wasn't stupid. I was not trying to shame you for that being stupid.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I'm trying to think of, like, 50-year time horizon, something like that.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yeah, I don't like the 50-year time horizon. I think the world changes too much. I'm into 10. You can get me at 10.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah, 10, I'm just, like, at 10... Again, if we're thinking about really understanding how the brain works, really understanding how aging works, really understanding Alzheimer's, will we get there in 10 years?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I don't think we will, no.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah, so why not think of 20 years? Because it seems like if we think about 10-year horizons, then we'll never find this Alzheimer's stuff.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> But, you know, the trouble is, play it back. It's, well, let's say...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Are you saying that if it's not tractable within 10 years... Then it's just too early to be finding this problem, essentially?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> No, no, no no. I don&#8217;t mean that. I don't mean that. I mean: if you're trying to attack Alzheimer's and you think it's a 50-year problem, the reason I would still try and think in 10-year chunks is that tools from other parts of biology, from AI, from whatever, will sweep in and hopefully be helpful in 10 years in a way that you can't predict now. So, if you just pick, I'm going to focus on Alzheimer's, I'm going to fund on Alzheimer's right now, but you don't yet have, you know, a clever probe that non-invasively detects XYZ that you end up getting in 10 years, then the work you did might not be that useful.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> The way I think about this is if I think about 50 years for Alzheimer's, then this kind of... where the middle ground is, it suggests that pure Alzheimer's &#8211; pure biological Alzheimer's research &#8211; is just not the right thing to fund right now for the reasons that you outlined, and, indeed, they're like more basic methods development things that will in the next 10 years get developed, and then over the course of coming decades really affect how more object-level Alzheimer's research is done &#8211; is the right thing.</p><p>So, this is why I'm interested in methods. I think you're right to say &#8211; I think you are right. Your argument is entirely correct, but I think in my case the fundamental thing I care about is still that the time horizon is too long, but the fact that there is such a long time horizon means that we need to move up the stack and fund something that will contribute to it over the longer term.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Okay. Yeah, I think the higher you move up the stack, the harder it is to know, you might end up not funding science. Maybe you end up funding something completely different, depending how high you go up the stack.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I think this is indeed, but I think a lot of things that are funded there, it's probably not going to be like theoretical physics, but it is going to be somewhere between, you know, applied physics and biometrics development...</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I think, yeah, that&#8217;s cool. If you do end up&#8211;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Does this like &#8211; you kind of, like, said it's cool and then didn't comment on this but like, does this make sense? [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Well, you know, if I was trying to work on Alzheimer's, which we have done some of the thing that we really try and avoid is working on conventional theories or on conventional approaches to the problem, because <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/\">NIA</a> &#8211; the part of NIH that funds Alzheimer's &#8211; the budget, you should fact-check me on this, but my memory is, like five years ago, or maybe seven years ago, when we started doing the funding, the budget was maybe 800 million a year on Alzheimer's, and now it's gone up to like 3 billion or 2.5 billion. It's gone way up.</p><p>So they're going to fund a lot of stuff, which is great, but that means that we have to go really contrarian. Within Alzheimer's, we go really contrarian. And so we look for unusual lines of evidence, and one that has been very interesting to watch, and that I was wrong about relative to my colleagues, Chris and Heather, and others &#8211; so, I place so much weight on neglectedness, and that I'm like, there's <em>so</em> much money in Alzheimer's. There's <em>so much money</em> in Alzheimer's. How the hell can we do anything in Alzheimer's? And then Chris and Heather were like &#8220;yeah, but a lot of that money is absolute trash.&#8221; You know, like, who cares about that money? And I go, &#8220;no, but if it's there, then if you have a project idea, still, you've got a better chance of getting some of it, right?&#8221; You know, we have this kind of debate. And they ended up funding a very unusual line of evidence with a relatively early career scientist to take on the next step of what has been a 30-year project by a more senior scientist in Columbia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lopera\">Francisco Lopera</a>, who worked with an extended family in Columbia who have familial Alzheimer's. They tend to develop Alzheimer's in their 40s, and there are thousands of people in this family over many years sort of working with them.</p><p>Then there's this group in Boston, <a href=\"https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/6326719/Yakeel-T.-Quiroz\">Yakeel Quiroz</a> and <a href=\"https://researchers.masseyeandear.org/details/278/joseph-arboleda-velasquez\">Joe Arboleda-Velasquez</a>, that <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2308583\">looked in a huge amount of depth at one member of the family</a> &#8211; or actually maybe two members of the family &#8211; who <em>did not</em> develop Alzheimer's in their 40s, but in fact went on to develop it in their 60s, so a long time afterwards. And you're like, well, what the hell happened there? This is a genetic form of Alzheimer's, so how the hell did they avoid it? This is <em>the polar opposite</em> of something like our TB vaccine grant, where there are thousands or tens of thousands of people, and you're taking a little bit of knowledge from each sample. This is like, there are two people, and you're going really in-depth and trying to learn as much as friggin' possible.</p><p>From those studies, there have come out potentially new targets &#8211; which would be wild if they end up being useful targets &#8211; of the <a href=\"https://www.alzforum.org/mutations/apoe-r154s-christchurch\">Christchurch allele</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reelin\">RELN gene variant</a> that they've mapped really carefully from looking at these brains, like what actually it looks like might have happened biochemically, and okay, maybe it makes sense of this observation in this other part of the literature 15 years ago.</p><p>So now maybe RELN is a gene you can try and play with as a drug target, maybe the Christchurch allele is important. And that you would never <em>in a million years</em> get from a conventional medical school or a conventional type of exercise on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta\">amyloid beta</a> or whatever. You just wouldn't ever get that. You have to go back and think what is this, how can I get something really weird to play into the story?</p><p>Now I forget the original question. I just got excited by that story.</p><p>[pause]</p><p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So how up the stack do you go? I don't know. I think you might want to do a mix. I'm not sure I'd go &#8211; there's still some low-hanging fruit left around, but there's so much money, I'd probably go up the stack. But we've done some down the stack as well.</p><p>We've funded a trial of a <em>sleep drug</em>, where, you know [gestures] if you sleep, that is good for you.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Oh, God. I actually didn't, as I started saying this...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I... I sleep.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I was not planning this. This was not an attack.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> It's okay. I sleep a lot these days.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> That's great. And if you can sleep half an hour more, which on <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/suvorexant-oral-route/description/drg-20113017\">suvorexant</a>, this drug, you probably can, then what happens if you randomize people, give some people this drug? They sleep for half an hour more. Will that affect their progression of Alzheimer's?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Wow. Did you fund this?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> <a href=\"https://clin-star.org/uploads/images/Lucey-Brendan-Beeson-2021.pdf#page=12\">We did fund this</a>. I mean, we haven't got the results. I'm very curious.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> This is great. I'm excited. This is exactly what I wanted to see. This is exactly the kind of sleep study I wanted to see. There are no RCTs where you just make people sleep more or less.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> God, I can't believe I didn't tell you this earlier, <a href=\"https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/\">given</a>... We haven't done much in sleep, but...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Wonderful. Well, I'd be happy to see that <a href=\"https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/\">my writing</a> is making some impact... probably not, but cool.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [laughs]</p><h2><strong>Jacob&#8217;s advice and views on purpose</strong></h2><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Advice for a talented 20-year-old watching this?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Oh, God. I don't know. Giving advice is so... People gave me advice when I was 20, and it didn't work.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> How about advice to your 20-year-old self? Do you have any?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> It's so hard, Alexey, because life ends up being what it is. And I can now see with more clarity what decisions I made ended up changing my life a lot.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> What do I do with that, though? You know, I don't see the other side. I didn't notice at the time that much that deciding to move to San Francisco when I was 22 would be a big decision that would have lots of downstream changes in my life. And now I have a group of best friends here. I have no plans to leave anytime soon. My job is here. My value system, I'm sure, is infected by lots of people around me. So, did I know when I, on a whim &#8211; <em>roughly</em> on a whim &#8211; did that in 2015 after grad school that it would be one of the... I narrativize it as one of the best decisions I've made. So, I guess maybe that's my advice to a 20-year-old Jacob. Just do what you're about to do. It's really good.</p><p>Then, there's sort of more personal, like, what are the other really big ones? Whether you decide to break up with certain people or date certain people and all that. So, but not that generalizable. Then&#8212;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Any love advice you'd give to a 20-year-old Jacob?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Love advice?</p><p>Well, when I was 20, I was very happily &#8211; [laughs] I was about to say very happily married, but that's not true &#8211; I was a very conventional 20-year-old. I dated the same man for all of undergrad and had a wonderful relationship. So maybe my 20-year-old self was on to something, you know, he had it pretty good.</p><p>Then, I think I have all sorts, actually, of sort of smaller romantic advice, but probably not for the podcast.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Advice for me?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Wait, hold on. But can... I don't want to give it, but do you want to give it? Do you have romantic advice?</p><p>[laughs]</p><p>That's what your listeners tune in for.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> My romantic advice for younger Alexey?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Yeah, well, don't go there if you don't want to go there.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> My romantic advice to my younger self was when we had this eight-hour-long conversation in May of 2022 when I was very conflicted about a lot of things, I should have followed up with you sometime soon afterwards instead of just kind of sweeping everything we talked under the rug and trying to pretend nothing happened, and then it just blew up months later. Yeah.</p><p>But I think it's the same thing, actually. It's very much the same thing as with New Science, where you just didn't have people to talk to about things. And that it&#8217;s this weekly thing where I would occasionally talk to someone about things that were happening in New Science. But if I talked once and talked through all the problems, it only happens once, there is no follow-up, so it doesn't actually matter.</p><p>I think the biggest thing that I do differently now is I just talk to my friends consistently about what's happening in my life.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Oh, cool.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> That's, yeah, I think that's universal advice. Talk to your friends who are not conflicted with you, not competitive with you, and who listen to you and who tell you what their thoughts are on whatever is happening.</p><p>Yeah, I think that&#8217;s the single biggest life lesson, in a way.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I co-sign that. You make me realize some of my life lessons are just learning from the inside the things that now sound trite.</p><p>Another angle on talking to your friends more about what's going on in your life is, like, who are your friends? The trite thing is completely true. The people you spend the most time with then shape who you are in terms of your values and what you think about.</p><p>I now understand that somewhat because I've changed. I can see the ways I've changed. I'm blind to many of them, I'm sure, but I can see some of them. And I can see the influence of particular people. I can see the influence of one particular person in this room, actually, in the way this room is set up. So, yeah, I think the extended mind as located in your closest friends or family or partner or children is very real. And so, that has various implications, yeah.</p><p>I'm with you. \\</p><p>And if you don't like someone that much and you end up spending time with them anyway, you will become close to them and you will become more like them. That's another one.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> There are different ways that can happen to people. Like, you hang out with your partner's friends a lot, for example. It's one.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> What's the meaning of life?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> At least we got easier than academia in 50 years. Of course, I dispute the question, but... You want one word, one sentence, one?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Whatever suits you?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> I mean, if it's one word. Love is pretty close to the meaning of life in one word. So, maybe I'll go with that.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Can you expand?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> That would be more than one word. How pretentious do you want me to go? I can...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> I would say, okay, just say whatever you want. And then if you aren&#8217;t... we can cut it.</p><p>[laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> But I'm curious.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Maybe I'll relate it to our conversation about science and about methods.</p><p>I think some of the most confusing parts of being alive are that the questions that I care about most, or that people in general maybe care about most, are not always well matched to the methods we have for producing generalizable knowledge.</p><p>So, for example, a lot of the most important questions are in the social realm. And the methods of social science do not produce generalizable knowledge as much, as often as people want. And, you know, there's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis\">famous debates</a> about which ones produce knowledge that's generalizable and in which ways. There is progress in those methods. I was just talking to a friend about progress in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_in_differences\">diff-and-diff</a> and how you change the staggering of how you do diff-and-diff in economics. You know, you can make methodological progress, but...</p><p>And then some of the questions are, like, you know, is there a God? And what is the meaning of life? And why do I feel this way when it doesn&#8217;t make any sense? Why do I feel so overwhelmed, what does it mean? Or, I feel nothing... The things that matter so much, we have no methods, or we have very weak methods. So we live in a state of knowledge-lessness about the things that touch us most deeply. To try and make that more professional, if the things that matter most often don&#8217;t touch the scientific methods, what does that imply for our jobs? I sometimes wonder about that.</p><p>To get back to your first question, why am I doing what I&#8217;m doing?</p><p>I think what I'm doing, I can see value in without having to answer deeper questions about what is valuable. Because if you give people the chance to not die of preventable diseases, I don't have to have a further normative sense of what is good for them, what is good for the world. I can just know that those people will go on to do whatever they end up doing, whatever they want to do. They'll have families. And so it's a philosophically easier area to work in because I don't have to solve impossible questions.</p><p>I don't know. That's probably mostly a dodge of your question.</p><h2><strong>Jacob&#8217;s favorite joke</strong></h2><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Can you tell me your favorite joke?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> A joke that my friendship group riffs on commonly, so maybe this counts as my favorite joke, have you seen <em>Airplane!</em>? The movie, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane!\">Airplane!</a></em>?</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [shakes head]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> That's a huge one for you. You get to watch it for the first time. It's a kind of old slapstick-ish movie.</p><p>And there's a recurring joke that I'll try and remember one instantiation of, which is... So they're on an airplane. It's in the title. And someone's having a medical problem. And so a doctor coming down the aisle grabs the air steward and says, &#8220;This woman is in trouble. We need to find a place to land the plane. She's got to go to hospital &#8211;&#8221; or, &#8220;we need a hospital.&#8221;</p><p>Ah, I <em>fucked up</em> the delivery...</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Okay, let's start again. Ready?</p><p>Wait, how does it go? How does my favorite joke go? Okay.</p><p>&#8220;We need to land this plane. She needs a hospital.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;A hospital? What is it?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It's a big building with patients in, but that's not important right now.&#8221;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> [laughs]</p><p>Then there's another version. It goes like,</p><p>&#8220;There's a problem in the cockpit.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The cockpit? What is it?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It's the small room at the front with the pilots in, but that's not important right now.&#8221;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> And so, Alexey, I'm worried about how this recent podcast I did went.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> What's a podcast?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> You have to say, &#8220;oh, what is it?&#8221;</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Oh, what is it?</p><p>Oh, sorry. Let's do it together. Let's do it together.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Alexey, I'm not feeling great about this. I'm worried about this recent podcast I did.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Oh, what is it?</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> A podcast. It's a recording of two men sitting in front of each other talking about &#8211; it's not important right now. It doesn&#8217;t have to be two men, but it statistically is.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> [laughs] Statistically, that&#8217;s great.</p><p><strong>TREFETHEN:</strong> Cool, thank you.</p><p><strong>GUZEY:</strong> Thanks for doing this.</p>"

After 5 months, his weight increased from 36.8 kg to 40.4 kg, and muscle mass increased from 25.1 kg to 30.1 kg. Muscle strength also improved. His physical function and swallowing ability also improved. In parallel with physical symptoms, score of ALS functional rating scale-revised improved.

Today, I\u2019d like to share one such story. The paper is Variational Inference for Uncertainty Quantification ,\nwritten with Lawrence Saul and Loucas Pillaud-Vivien to appear in the Journal of Machine Learning Research and here\u2019s the abstract: Given an intractable distribution $p$, the problem of variational inference (VI) is to find the best approximation from some more tractable family $\\mathcal Q$. Commonly, one chooses $\\mathcal Q$ to be a family of factorized distributions (i.e., the mean-field assumption), even though $p$ itself does not factorize. We show that this mismatch can lead to an impossibility theorem: if $p$ does not factorize and furthermore has a non-diagonal covariance matrix, then any factorized approximation $q \\in \\mathcal Q$ can correctly estimate at most one of the following three measures of uncertainty: (i) the marginal variances, (ii) the marginal precisions, or (iii) the generalized variance (which for elliptical distributions is closely related to the entropy). In practice, the best variational approximation in $\\mathcal Q$ is found by minimizing some divergence $D(q,p)$ between distributions, and so we ask: how does the choice of divergence determine which measure of uncertainty, if any, is correctly estimated by VI? We consider the classic Kullback-Leibler divergences, the more general $\\alpha$-divergences, and a score-based divergence which compares $\\nabla \\log p$ and $\\nabla \\log q$. We thoroughly analyze the case where $p$ is a Gaussian and $q$ is a (factorized) Gaussian. In this setting, we show that all the considered divergences can be ordered based on the estimates of uncertainty they yield as objective functions for VI. Finally, we empirically evaluate the validity of this ordering when the target distribution p is not Gaussian. Disclaimer: During the job search, this was not the paper I spoke about :)\nMy favorite paper (that I\u2019ve written) is probably still the nested $\\widehat R$ paper .\nBut when I got home from an interview, I started thinking, the VI for uncertainty could\u2019ve also been a good paper to discuss and I drafted this blog post way\nback in February. (February 9th 2025) A textbook question A little over two years ago, I started working on variational inference (VI).\nAs I read the literature, I kept coming across the comment that \u201cVI\nunderestimates uncertainty\u201d and I wanted to convince myself of this fact with\na simple example. Say I approximate a non-factorized Gaussian with a factorized\nGaussian, can I show that the approximation always underestimates the marginal\nvariances? So I scribbled and scribbled, and I didn\u2019t get anywhere.\nNo problem: VI legend Lawrence Saul was down the hall\n(at the Flatiron Institute ),\nand I submitted this textbook problem to him. He agreed the result seemed elementary.\nIn fact, many books and review papers proved the claim in 2-D, and it seemed\nstraightforward to generalize it to higher dimensions. So we went to the black board, and we tinkered, and tinkered, and\u2026 hmmm\u2026\ncould this problem be harder than we thought? We did eventually write a proof: it was short but unintuitive. (I didn\u2019t like\nthis proof.) (The excellent paper by Turner & Sahini (2011) has a statement of the result, albeit without a proof.)\nThen we derived more results on variance estimation and wrote a precursor to our paper on VI uncertainty. A fleeting shadow Lawrence felt strongly that in addition to variance we should also analyze entropy\nas a measure of uncertainty. And we did find that VI also underestimates entropy.\nBut when I ran numerical experiments, something surprising\ntranspired. As dimension increased, I found that estimates of the variance\nbecame worst, while estimates of the entropy improved. This contradicted our\nvisuals: the volume of the approximating sphere was clearly much smaller than\nthe volume of the target ellipsoid. For entropies to match, you would need\nthe volumes of the two objects to be the same. Fig1. Factorized Gaussian approximation of an $n$-dimensional Gaussian. The target\nhas a covariance matrix with constant off-diagonal element $\\varepsilon$. I checked and double-checked my code, and I couldn\u2019t find an error. And then I\nhad a happy thought. The two dimensional picture we were looking at was\nmisleading. The sphere was not smaller than the ellipsoid, even though its shadow was.\nEach time we \u201cadded\u201d back a dimension, the sphere would grow in every direction, while the\nellipsoid would only grow a little bit. Until eventually, the volume of the\ntwo objects nearly matched. Here\u2019s another way to understand the result. Setting correlations to 0 (as one\ndoes with the factorized/mean-field approximation) increases entropy. If our\ngoal is to match the entropy of the target, the increase in volume caused by\nthe null correlation must be compensated by a shrinkage in the marginal variances.\nConversely, matching the variances means overestimating the entropy of the target. The two\nmeasures of uncertainty therefore compete with one another. This fact is\nelegantly captured by an equation we termed the shrinkage-delinkage trade-off .\nHere it is, without any proper definition of the terms but just to highlight its simplicity: $$ \\Delta \\mathcal H = \\frac{1}{2} \\log |S| - \\frac{1}{2} \\log |C|^{-1}. $$ This late result became the main character of our precursor paper. I presented this result at the UAI conference 2023 in Pittsburg. It was a fun\nconference, mostly because I met some amazing PhD students and postdocs to\nhang out with. I should now mention that all the work Lawrence and I did was\nbased on minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, $$\n\\text{KL}(q||p) = \\int (\\log q(z) - \\log p(z)) q(z) \\text d z,\n$$ which is the usual\nobjective function we minimize in VI. Many people asked me if I had thought\nabout what would happen if I minimized other divergences\nand I figured this would be a straightforward extension.\nIt would also allow me to address a question that had long pre-occupied me,\nnamely what is the best way to compare probability distributions? Thanksgiving break So back to the blackboard (we have beautiful blackboards at the Flatiron\nInstitute). I looked at a few divergences and even some metrics. Did you\nknow there is not analytical expression for the total variation distance\nbetween two multivariate Gaussians? It turned out the KL-divergence was\nparticularly easy to manipulate, with other divergences posing additional\nchallenges. Still, we made progress, one divergence at a time. I had another small breakthrough on Thanksgiving. I remember I was taking the\nbus to Pennsylvania. I had missed my original bus and then, I received an email,\ntelling me another paper of mine had gotten rejected. I read the reviews and\nfelt absolutely gutted. I can still see it: the overcrowded bus terminal, the\nendless waiting, the phone call I made to a close one, the reviews I read and\nre-read and re-read. It was a sunny day. I was fortunate to be with family that\nday. And the next morning, I woke up early and felt the need to make amends\nfor my \u201cfailure\u201d. I sat in the kitchen and extended the shrinkage-delinkage\ntrade-off to a three-way impossibility theorem between precision, variance,\nand entropy. Loucas\u2019 napkin I had intended to submit a manuscript by the end of November, with the hope\nthat within a year, my paper would be reviewed and accepted, and that this\nwould strengthen my application for my next job. (None of this happened.) Some\nof the results resisted us. Lawrence and I had an incredibly difficult time\nproving an \u201cordering\u201d of the Renyi $\\alpha$-divergences. We felt close: each\nweek, we believed we would finish the proof; and each week, the last piece\nof the puzzle eluded us. One day, I was working at the white board, messing around with the terms of\nan equation. My then fellow post-doc Loucas Pillaud-Vivien walked by and asked\nme what I was working on. So I explained the problem. He then grabbed a marker\nand began working in his corner of the white board. He shared his ideas, his\nperspective as a theorist and a probabilist. He spoke about \u201cagreeable facts\u201d,\nhe dug out results from linear algebra that I wasn\u2019t familiar with. It was also\nfun for me to revisit the topic in French, somehow it gave me a fresh\nperspective. (Loucas was also French.) And so, Loucas joined forces with Lawrence and I. I remember the day when we\nfinally cracked the proof. It was a Friday. We  felt close (as always) and it\nwas getting late. Another one of our colleagues brought beers and we drank\nthem in front of the white board. Now we were one or two details away from\nthe contradiction that would complete the proof. But I had a ballroom dance\npractice and I left the office. Later that night, while I was warming up at the dance studio, I got a message\nfrom Loucas: \u201cI think I got it. You can dance in peace.\u201d Dance in peace?? No,\nI had to see the proof for myself before being \u201cat peace\u201d. Right after practice,\nLoucas and I met at the usual Mexican bar and he completed the proof on a napkin, which is\na cliche, but we had ran out of paper. After that, it took me quite a bit of time to check all the proofs, scattered\nin my notebooks, and patch together the missing details. And of course,\nLawrence made an heroic effort editing the manuscript and making sure it lived\nup to his very high writing standards.\nI suppose the story is far from finished, since the paper is still under review\u2026! Afterthought (November 11th) I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything extraordinary about this project. It\u2019s a\ntypical good research story and illustrates one of the happy collaborations I\nhad as a postdoc. Some of the results seem elementary, or to use a more\nflattering word, fundamental. (A reviewer criticized results I had in another\npaper as \u201celementary\u201d and it had never occurred to me that this word could\nhave a negative connotation.) I trust we will see the results we derived in\nupcoming textbooks. With time, I was able to simplify several of the proofs.\nAt this point, I am aware of four proofs to show VI underestimates variance,\neach offering its particular perspective. p.s. The paper was desk-rejected from a first journal. We then revised it quite\na bit and sent it to JMLR. After a few months, we got requests for some\nminor revisions and the paper was published another few months later.",

Since I have the most experience with\nBRFSS, I started with just some simple visualizations looking at the\ndata through a cohort lense. Things run a bit slow to use srvyr or\nsurvey functions to get estimates of variance, so I\u2019ll just use weighted\nmeans and rely on inter-year variability to show the variation (at least\nfor now, for this exploratory work). I think the best graphs come from the most simple variable whether the\nrespondent has smoked 100 cigarettes total in their lifetime. Here they\nare in gif form: If that gif makes your head swim, here\u2019s a faceted graph showing every\n5th cohort\u2019s trends. I see 4 phases of broad trends: Not enough data (Roughly 1890-1905) At first there\u2019s just not enough data and so there\u2019s too much\nvariation to see any clear trends. BRFSS doesn\u2019t have a lot of\npeople in the older age groups. A big part of this is due to people\ndying, but also the BRFSS sample frame doesn\u2019t cover nursing homes\nor long-term care facilities so it\u2019s coverage of older respondents\nis pretty poor. Further, to make this anaysis as simple as possible,\nI don\u2019t include respondents in the top-coded age categories (97 in\n1984, 80 in 2012 and later, and 99 in all other years). Differential mortality & women catch up (Roughly 1905-1935) Because we are looking at ever smoking, the fact that the slope goes\ndown is somewhat confusing. For each person, they can never change\nfrom an ever smoker to a never smoker. Yet, the percentage of the\ncohort who are ever smokers goes down in this period. This is\nself-reported data of course, so some of it could be changes in\nrecall or social desirability bias as time goes on, but a big part\nof it is likely due to the fact that there is differential mortality\nbetween people who have ever smoked and those who have not. This can\nbe caused both by the harmful effects of smoking as well as other\nbehaviors that are correlated with smoking such as alcohol and other\ndrugs and other risk behaviors. Another interesting thing to look at in this phase of the gif is that\nwomen are catching up to men in smoking prevalence. Presumably this is\nevidence of women\u2019s liberation and other changes in social norms around\nwomen\u2019s behavior. Rates fall, and men converge to women (Roughly 1935-1965) After generally increasing (probably partly due to differential\nmortality), the rates begin to fall pretty quickly cohort birth year\nover year. At the beginning of this phase, ~75% of men and 60% of\nwomen have ever smoked, and by the end they are below 50%. Seeing introduction of smoking (1965-2013) These groups are the first that we are seeing young enough for \nsignificant numbers of new ever smokers to be introduced (both because \nthey are younger when the first survey interviewed them and because the age of smoking introduction is getting older). This is shown by the \nupward trend for each cohort. It appears like men are starting to smoke \nmore than women again, though there\u2019s not enough data to be completely \nsure. Those are the first set of graphs I made from BRFSS. Hopefully soon I\u2019ll\nshow something about currently smoking and retrospective prevalence from\nBRFSS as well as some of the other surveys we have harmonized (YRBSS,\nNSDUH, NHIS).

This is\nself-reported data of course, so some of it could be changes in\nrecall or social desirability bias as time goes on, but a big part\nof it is likely due to the fact that there is differential mortality\nbetween people who have ever smoked and those who have not. This can\nbe caused both by the harmful effects of smoking as well as other\nbehaviors that are correlated with smoking such as alcohol and other\ndrugs and other risk behaviors.</p>\n\n    <p>Another interesting thing to look at in this phase of the gif is that\nwomen are catching up to men in smoking prevalence. Presumably this is\nevidence of women\u2019s liberation and other changes in social norms around\nwomen\u2019s behavior.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Rates fall, and men converge to women (Roughly 1935-1965)</strong><br />\nAfter generally increasing (probably partly due to differential\nmortality), the rates begin to fall pretty quickly cohort birth year\nover year. At the beginning of this phase, ~75% of men and 60% of\nwomen have ever smoked, and by the end they are below 50%.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Seeing introduction of smoking (1965-2013)</strong> \nThese groups are the first that we are seeing young enough for \nsignificant numbers of new ever smokers to be introduced (both because \nthey are younger when the first survey interviewed them and because the age of smoking introduction is getting older). This is shown by the \nupward trend for each cohort. It appears like men are starting to smoke \nmore than women again, though there\u2019s not enough data to be completely \nsure.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Those are the first set of graphs I made from BRFSS. Hopefully soon I\u2019ll\nshow something about currently smoking and retrospective prevalence from\nBRFSS as well as some of the other surveys we have harmonized (YRBSS,\nNSDUH, NHIS).</p>\n\n<p>I can\u2019t really share the data yet (hopefully soon), but here\u2019s the code\nused to produce these plots (man it\u2019d be nice to have collapsible code\nblocks in this blog CMS).</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>suppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(dplyr)\n  library(gganimate) # requires devtools::install_github(\"gergness/gganimate@1d611fa\")\n  library(ggplot2)\n  library(mpctools)\n  library(purrr)\n  library(readr)\n  library(srvyr)\n  library(tibble)\n  library(tidyr)\n})\n\n# Load data ---------\nout_dir &lt;- \"~/smoking_age_cohort/interim_data/\"\nbrfss_years &lt;- 1984:2013\n\ncalc_age_clean &lt;- function(age, year) {\n  # NAs for top code because we don't know their real age...\n  ifelse((year == 1984 &amp; age &gt;= 97) |\n           (year &gt;= 1985 &amp; year &lt;= 2012 &amp; age &gt;= 99) | \n           (year == 2013 &amp; age &gt;= 80), \n         NA, age)\n  \n}\n\nall_brfss &lt;- map_df(brfss_years, function(yyy) {\n  out &lt;- readRDS(paste0(out_dir, \"/person/brfss\", yyy, \"a.Rds\")) %&gt;%\n    set_names(tolower(names(.))) %&gt;% \n    mutate(\n      age = as.numeric(age), \n      age_clean = calc_age_clean(age, yyy),\n      cohort = yyy - age_clean,\n      sex = haven::as_factor(sex), \n      survey_year = yyy\n    ) %&gt;% \n    filter(!is.na(age_clean))\n  \n  # Get weights\n  if (yyy &lt;= 2010) {\n    out &lt;- mutate(out, weights = landwt)\n  } else {\n    out &lt;-  mutate(out, weights = llcpwt)\n  }   \n  \n  out\n})\n\n\n# Calcualte ever Smoked -------------\ncalc_smokev_bin &lt;- function(smokev) {\n  smokev == 2\n}\n\never_smoked_data &lt;- all_brfss %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    smokev_bin = calc_smokev_bin(smokev), \n    year = survey_year\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(sex, age_clean, cohort, year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    ever_smoked = weighted.mean(smokev_bin, weights, na.rm = TRUE), \n    n = sum(!is.na(smokev_bin))\n  )\n\n# Animated plot ------------\never_smoked_plot_data &lt;- ever_smoked_data %&gt;% \n  # To make graphs more readable\n  filter(cohort &gt; 1905)\nplot &lt;- ggplot(\n  ever_smoked_plot_data, \n  aes(x = year, y = ever_smoked, group = paste0(sex, \"-\", cohort), color = sex, \n      frame = cohort, cumulative = TRUE, alpha_decay = function(x) exp(-x/5))\n) + \n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw() + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#984ea3\", \"#ff7f00\")) + \n  scale_y_continuous(\"Ever smoked\", labels = scales::percent) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Cohort: \",\n    subtitle = \"Prevalence of ever smoking\", \n    caption = \"Data: BRFSS 1984-2013\"\n  )\n\ngg_animate(plot, interval = 0.15)\n\n# Static plot ------------\never_smoked_plot_data &lt;- ever_smoked_data %&gt;% \n  # To make graphs more readable\n  filter(cohort %in% seq(1905, 2005, by = 5))\n  \nggplot(ever_smoked_plot_data, aes(x = year, y = ever_smoked, group = sex, color = sex)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~cohort) + \n  theme_bw() + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#984ea3\", \"#ff7f00\")) + \n  scale_y_continuous(\"Ever smoked\", labels = scales::percent) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Prevalence of ever smoking by cohort (every 5th year)\", \n    caption = \"Data: BRFSS 1984-2013\"\n  )\n</code></pre>\n</div>"

Last week he introduced us to several Missouri natives who made a national impact on agricultural education and the FFA. That continues this week. Take it away Dr. Tummons. Three-circle model Both Larry Case and Steve Brown reflected on the importance of the three-circle model of Agricultural Education in guiding their work. Case brought up the model as a key piece of his philosophy he brought from Missouri. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any different. That\u2019s the way we did it in Missouri. And it worked\u201d. Case recalled times of friction over the competing priorities within the profession: that FFA had no right to tell Agricultural Education what to do. Case mentioned an FFA Board of Directors meeting where he was trying to get money together for a strategic plan based on the green book. Hearing push back, he drew the 3 circles on a flip chart and pointed to the center portion where all circles overlapped. \u201cAnd I said every one of you people in here are Agricultural Educators first and FFA advisor second. And if you can\u2019t make a decision to help support the mother program of education, we won\u2019t have an FFA. We have a vested interest in seeing to it that [the strategic plan] happens. They [FFA Board] passed $75,000, and that was a lot of money in those days to set up and try to do a strategic plan\u2026 But anyway, what I think that plan did was codify our beliefs.\u201d \u00a0(Case) Figure 1. The Strategic Plan for Agricultural Education Case reflected on promoting the 3-circle model. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to serve those students and take their dues, money and so forth, you got to figure out what they need and serve them. That was the kind of the launchpad where the three-circle model influenced me tremendously.\u201d Case credits Dr. Steve Brown with promoting the 3-circle model within the profession. \u201cI would tell you this, I would give Steve Brown more of the credit for getting the three-circle model in the literature. Brown set the modern-day terminology that education reformers were using.\u201d Dr. Steve Brown grew up as a member of the Orrick FFA chapter. Steve earned his BS, MS, and PhD in Agricultural Education at the University of Missouri. Upon completing his BS, Steve taught Agricultural Education for five years in Macon. In 1986, Brown left the classroom to work at DESE as a district supervisor and FFA executive secretary. Bob Chapman served as FFA Executive Secretary for a short time between Hagan and Brown. Brown worked at DESE for 24 years. Brown served for two years as National FFA executive secretary with Dr. Case, then served from 2010-2020 as the last USDE specialist and National FFA advisor. Dr. Brown also reflected on the importance of the 3 interconnected components of agricultural education as a foundation of his philosophy for the profession. \u201cI think one of the basic things, the grounding I received at the university instruction, was the focus on the three-component model, and I just feel like that has been the building block for most of my career.\u201d Brown discussed how he expanded the model during his time. Well, I\u2019m a die-hard believer in the three-component model, but I think that it is critical to truly understand that model, and what it represents, and how it\u2019s to be delivered. And sometimes, how it\u2019s to be delivered changes a little bit, so that is critical. We\u2019ve expanded the classroom part to be contextual, inquiry-based learning, and SAE to include work-based learning and implementation. The same way with leadership and personal development through FFA, PAS and the National Young Farmers. It\u2019s about developing activities and engaging ALL students. Figure 2. The Three Circle Agricultural Education Model Dr. Brown was an early adopter of computers and technology; he developed many of the early electronic FFA award applications. When I served in Missouri, I tried to solve problematic issues.\u00a0 Developing an electronic state degree application followed by the American FFA Degree in Microsoft Excel.\u00a0\u00a0 Other states (10 to 12) began to use a similar format. Most of them have now graduated from that to AET or developed their own system, but I guess, it was rewarding to be a frontrunner in developing the award applications such as chapter activity, proficiency, choir, band and even the American FFA degree. It all began by National FFA trying to launch two years in a row a stand-alone computerized American FFA degree application with very limited success. And that\u2019s when I said to myself, I think I can do this in Microsoft Excel and National FFA was pleased with the prototypes provided. National Quality Program Standards Missouri agricultural education was strongly represented in the development of the National Quality Program Standards for Agricultural Education. As a young teacher, I used the Missouri Program Standards and Quality Indicators (blue book) to improve my program in the early 2000s. Dr. Terry Heiman provides a further description. The [Missouri] Program Standards and Quality Indicators (blue book) was a collaborative effort by Joint Staff with input from local school administrators. The Program Planning Handbook had been developed earlier and was a precursor to the question of how to describe a quality program. A common question when meeting with local school administrators and teacher visitations was how to effectively describe what a local program could/should look like. Then the need for self-assessment of local programs in conjunction with advisory committees and school administrators became the focus. To my knowledge this was the first effort to develop a local assessment tool for teachers and schools. Dr. Case mentioned the formation of the National Quality Program Standards as project of the Council in the September/October 2004 Agricultural Education Magazine (Case, 2004). Case stated the strategic plan called for the development of these National quality indicators for secondary agricultural education programs by May 2005. Figure 3. National Quality Program Standards document I asked Dr. Brown about his role in developing the NQPS. I served on the National Council for Agricultural Education. I and Dr. David Hall on the Council were given the task of trying to develop the National Quality Program Standards. It was Dr. David Hall, (who has passed) and myself who spearheaded the work on that and developed the National Quality Program Standards along with a committee of state leaders and who developed the concepts, and then ask the Council to dig into it and approve it and move it forward. I think we (Missouri) had an opportunity to influence that or share our things we thought were critical, and so it [Missouri standards] was some of the basis, as well as some work in Ohio and Oklahoma, to develop that\u2026 the National Quality Program Standards. Dr. Heiman confirmed how the Missouri blue book was a foundational document for the NQPS. \u201cThe Missouri effort was shared nationally and was used as a base document by many states to develop their own standards and quality indicators. After a few years it became the foundation for the national quality standards. The format and verbiage are very similar.\u201d I pulled the Missouri Program Standards and Quality Indicators and compared the standards to the 2009 version of the National Quality program standards in Figure 4. Figure 4.\u00a0Comparison of Blue book standards and 2009 National Quality Program Standards. Brown recalled some of the challenges and opportunities in the conversations around the Missouri model feeding into the National Quality Program Standards. \u201cI think one that was challenging and is difficult is the adult components. In Missouri at the time, we had a pretty strong adult program, and so that component was, scrutinized, or difficult for other states.\u201d Missouri\u2019s Joint State Staff served as a collaborative model for other states to increase communication among leaders. A lot of states did not have things like that [Joint State Staff], where we worked with the teacher educators, and the State Department of Education, and the Teacher Association to all work hand-in-hand to move things forward. I always thought that [Missouri] was a good model for states to have a joint group, because if all three entities agree and come to conclusion this is the direction, the way to go, versus\u2026 regarding curriculum or any other aspects of agriculture education, it was probably going to happen. The people are in those leadership positions, they have the respect of the profession, and so there\u2019s a tendency to listen to them and what they have to say, and they also have some of the rationale of why they think a particular item is important, and I think it helps younger teachers as well as the profession to understand, yes, this is something we should do. Missouri compromise- bringing together the different parts of the nation. I asked Dr. Heiman to reflect on how Dr. Case and Dr. Brown brought Missouri Agricultural Education to the national level. I think what stands out is Missouri was formed as a compromise state, way back when we became a state. That [compromise] has been one of the attributes of Missourians that work on a national level. They understand you must listen to the North, the South, the East, and the West to come up with the best solutions to whatever\u2019s confronting us. Both of those gentlemen express that and demonstrate that very well. They [Case and Brown] don\u2019t have to have the best ideas, but they can collaborate and find the best ideas that work for the nation. Dr. Case believed in leading change through recognition. Part of the philosophy behind trying to lead change is \u2018what gets recognized gets done\u2019. We had to broaden the curriculum. We decided somewhere along the line to have a national winner for the Agriscience Teacher of the year, and a national award for the Agriscience Student of the Year. What that did was provide focus for Ag teachers and others across the country to be able to say, \u2018You know, I\u2019m getting recognized here for doing something a bit different.\u2019\u00a0 And of course, that parlayed into now for Stars, you know, at the American degree level. I don\u2019t want to say we used FFA, but the way FFA influenced the direction of our nation was to provide recognition for outstanding achievement, which was our role to do with students, and we just parlayed it over into the teaching part there a little bit, which, that award eventually moved to the teacher\u2019s organization. So that was still trying to keep FFA separate some rather than aggregation. I asked Dr. Brown for his leadership strategies to help facilitate change. Brown: Communications includes speaking AND listening. You know, explaining why you want to have a good rationale of why you think that change is important for the advancement of the organization and or Agricultural Education, and then communicating that to state leaders and others, and actually then listening to what they have to say to see if there\u2019s something that you\u2019ve overlooked, or an obstacle that you need to make sure we tackle before making the change. It\u2019s got to be a two-way communication. Sometimes just listening, sometimes working with state and national leaders, just listening to what they have to say and listening to the challenges that they\u2019re facing, you can also help in helping solve some of those by just listening and then implementing or putting policy in place that will help them address it. Dr. Heiman worked closely with Dr. Brown for many years. \u201cI think he [Brown] was a great collaborator, and worked for agreed upon goals, outcomes, and looking towards the future. [Brown] identified resources and people that could move FFA forward. I really respect his perseverance and his ability to stay true to the mission.\u201d Missouri\u2019s six agricultural education districts express the geologic and sociologic differences within our state. Southern Missouri looks pretty southern in its agriculture; farmers and ranchers raise poultry, cattle, hay, timber, rice, cotton, catfish, peaches, pecans, and watermelons. Above the Missouri river, Missouri looks very mid-western with its row crops, hogs, and cattle. Saint Louis was an east-coast city, laid out in its first-generation immigrant neighborhoods. Kansas City was a frontier and cattle town. I can see how serving Missouri Agricultural Education is helpful preparation in leading the national organization. As FFA approaches its 100th anniversary, the legacy of Missouri \u2014 its people, its traditions, and its vision \u2014 remains central to the story of agricultural education in America. Figure 5.

Hearing push back, he drew the 3 circles on a flip chart and pointed to the center portion where all circles overlapped.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">\u201cAnd I said every one of you people in here are Agricultural Educators first and FFA advisor second. And if you can&#8217;t make a decision to help support the mother program of education, we won&#8217;t have an FFA. We have a vested interest in seeing to it that [the strategic plan] happens. They [FFA Board] passed $75,000, and that was a lot of money in those days to set up and try to do a strategic plan\u2026 But anyway, what I think that plan did was codify our beliefs.\u201d \u00a0(Case)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4118\" height=\"386\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/drive/1fPxcON_bGsMZGfWnxqqFl2R21WJpjSpC/Strategic%20plan.jpg\" width=\"300\" />Figure 1. The Strategic Plan for Agricultural Education</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Case reflected on promoting the 3-circle model. \u201cIf you&#8217;re going to serve those students and take their dues, money and so forth, you got to figure out what they need and serve them. That was the kind of the launchpad where the three-circle model influenced me tremendously.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Case credits Dr. Steve Brown with promoting the 3-circle model within the profession. \u201cI would tell you this, I would give Steve Brown more of the credit for getting the three-circle model in the literature. Brown set the modern-day terminology that education reformers were using.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Steve Brown grew up as a member of the Orrick FFA chapter. Steve earned his BS, MS, and PhD in Agricultural Education at the University of Missouri. Upon completing his BS, Steve taught Agricultural Education for five years in Macon. In 1986, Brown left the classroom to work at DESE as a district supervisor and FFA executive secretary. Bob Chapman served as FFA Executive Secretary for a short time between Hagan and Brown. Brown worked at DESE for 24 years. Brown served for two years as National FFA executive secretary with Dr. Case, then served from 2010-2020 as the last USDE specialist and National FFA advisor.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Brown also reflected on the importance of the 3 interconnected components of agricultural education as a foundation of his philosophy for the profession. \u201cI think one of the basic things, the grounding I received at the university instruction, was the focus on the three-component model, and I just feel like that has been the building block for most of my career.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown discussed how he expanded the model during his time.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">Well, I&#8217;m a die-hard believer in the three-component model, but I think that it is critical to truly understand that model, and what it represents, and how it&#8217;s to be delivered. And sometimes, how it&#8217;s to be delivered changes a little bit, so that is critical. We\u2019ve expanded the classroom part to be contextual, inquiry-based learning, and SAE to include work-based learning and implementation. The same way with leadership and personal development through FFA, PAS and the National Young Farmers. It\u2019s about developing activities and engaging ALL students.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4117\" height=\"269\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/drive/1QYvQTAbO4g5y72Qr5NfaKyBcy7YnVp3q/Three-Circle-Model.jpg\" width=\"300\" />Figure 2. The Three Circle Agricultural Education Model</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Brown was an early adopter of computers and technology; he developed many of the early electronic FFA award applications.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">When I served in Missouri, I tried to solve problematic issues.\u00a0 Developing an electronic state degree application followed by the American FFA Degree in Microsoft Excel.\u00a0\u00a0 Other states (10 to 12) began to use a similar format. Most of them have now graduated from that to AET or developed their own system, but I guess, it was rewarding to be a frontrunner in developing the award applications such as chapter activity, proficiency, choir, band and even the American FFA degree. It all began by National FFA trying to launch two years in a row a stand-alone computerized American FFA degree application with very limited success. And that&#8217;s when I said to myself, I think I can do this in Microsoft Excel and National FFA was pleased with the prototypes provided.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><strong>National Quality Program Standards</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Missouri agricultural education was strongly represented in the development of the National Quality Program Standards for Agricultural Education. As a young teacher, I used the Missouri Program Standards and Quality Indicators (blue book) to improve my program in the early 2000s. Dr. Terry Heiman provides a further description.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">The [Missouri] Program Standards and Quality Indicators (blue book) was a collaborative effort by Joint Staff with input from local school administrators. The Program Planning Handbook had been developed earlier and was a precursor to the question of how to describe a quality program.<br />\nA common question when meeting with local school administrators and teacher visitations was how to effectively describe what a local program could/should look like. Then the need for self-assessment of local programs in conjunction with advisory committees and school administrators became the focus. To my knowledge this was the first effort to develop a local assessment tool for teachers and schools.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Case mentioned the formation of the National Quality Program Standards as project of the Council in the September/October 2004 Agricultural Education Magazine (Case, 2004). Case stated the strategic plan called for the development of these National quality indicators for secondary agricultural education programs by May 2005.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4115\" height=\"372\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/drive/1TeDbPZSc9kJlByuN2zsGRZ3c3TXnXC5Z/quality%20with%20border.jpg\" width=\"320\" />Figure 3. National Quality Program Standards document</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I asked Dr. Brown about his role in developing the NQPS.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">I served on the National Council for Agricultural Education. I and Dr. David Hall on the Council were given the task of trying to develop the National Quality Program Standards. It was Dr. David Hall, (who has passed) and myself who spearheaded the work on that and developed the National Quality Program Standards along with a committee of state leaders and who developed the concepts, and then ask the Council to dig into it and approve it and move it forward.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">I think we (Missouri) had an opportunity to influence that or share our things we thought were critical, and so it [Missouri standards] was some of the basis, as well as some work in Ohio and Oklahoma, to develop that\u2026 the National Quality Program Standards.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Heiman confirmed how the Missouri blue book was a foundational document for the NQPS. \u201cThe Missouri effort was shared nationally and was used as a base document by many states to develop their own standards and quality indicators. After a few years it became the foundation for the national quality standards. The format and verbiage are very similar.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I pulled the Missouri Program Standards and Quality Indicators and compared the standards to the 2009 version of the National Quality program standards in Figure 4.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4119\" height=\"352\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/2025/11/Tummons-Figure-4-1024x681.png\" width=\"530\" />Figure 4.\u00a0Comparison of Blue book standards and 2009 National Quality Program Standards.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown recalled some of the challenges and opportunities in the conversations around the Missouri model feeding into the National Quality Program Standards. \u201cI think one that was challenging and is difficult is the adult components. In Missouri at the time, we had a pretty strong adult program, and so that component was, scrutinized, or difficult for other states.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Missouri\u2019s Joint State Staff served as a collaborative model for other states to increase communication among leaders.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">A lot of states did not have things like that [Joint State Staff], where we worked with the teacher educators, and the State Department of Education, and the Teacher Association to all work hand-in-hand to move things forward.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">I always thought that [Missouri] was a good model for states to have a joint group, because if all three entities agree and come to conclusion this is the direction, the way to go, versus\u2026 regarding curriculum or any other aspects of agriculture education, it was probably going to happen. The people are in those leadership positions, they have the respect of the profession, and so there&#8217;s a tendency to listen to them and what they have to say, and they also have some of the rationale of why they think a particular item is important, and I think it helps younger teachers as well as the profession to understand, yes, this is something we should do.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><strong>Missouri compromise- bringing together the different parts of the nation.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I asked Dr. Heiman to reflect on how Dr. Case and Dr. Brown brought Missouri Agricultural Education to the national level.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">I think what stands out is Missouri was formed as a compromise state, way back when we became a state. That [compromise] has been one of the attributes of Missourians that work on a national level. They understand you must listen to the North, the South, the East, and the West to come up with the best solutions to whatever&#8217;s confronting us. Both of those gentlemen express that and demonstrate that very well. They [Case and Brown] don&#8217;t have to have the best ideas, but they can collaborate and find the best ideas that work for the nation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Case believed in leading change through recognition.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">Part of the philosophy behind trying to lead change is \u2018what gets recognized gets done\u2019. We had to broaden the curriculum. We decided somewhere along the line to have a national winner for the Agriscience Teacher of the year, and a national award for the Agriscience Student of the Year. What that did was provide focus for Ag teachers and others across the country to be able to say, \u2018You know, I&#8217;m getting recognized here for doing something a bit different.\u2019\u00a0 And of course, that parlayed into now for Stars, you know, at the American degree level. I don&#8217;t want to say we used FFA, but the way FFA influenced the direction of our nation was to provide recognition for outstanding achievement, which was our role to do with students, and we just parlayed it over into the teaching part there a little bit, which, that award eventually moved to the teacher\u2019s organization. So that was still trying to keep FFA separate some rather than aggregation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I asked Dr. Brown for his leadership strategies to help facilitate change.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">Brown: Communications includes speaking AND listening. You know, explaining why you want to have a good rationale of why you think that change is important for the advancement of the organization and or Agricultural Education, and then communicating that to state leaders and others, and actually then listening to what they have to say to see if there&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ve overlooked, or an obstacle that you need to make sure we tackle before making the change.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">It&#8217;s got to be a two-way communication. Sometimes just listening, sometimes working with state and national leaders, just listening to what they have to say and listening to the challenges that they&#8217;re facing, you can also help in helping solve some of those by just listening and then implementing or putting policy in place that will help them address it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Heiman worked closely with Dr. Brown for many years. \u201cI think he [Brown] was a great collaborator, and worked for agreed upon goals, outcomes, and looking towards the future. [Brown] identified resources and people that could move FFA forward. I really respect his perseverance and his ability to stay true to the mission.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Missouri\u2019s six agricultural education districts express the geologic and sociologic differences within our state. Southern Missouri looks pretty southern in its agriculture; farmers and ranchers raise poultry, cattle, hay, timber, rice, cotton, catfish, peaches, pecans, and watermelons. Above the Missouri river, Missouri looks very mid-western with its row crops, hogs, and cattle. Saint Louis was an east-coast city, laid out in its first-generation immigrant neighborhoods. Kansas City was a frontier and cattle town. I can see how serving Missouri Agricultural Education is helpful preparation in leading the national organization. As FFA approaches its 100th anniversary, the legacy of Missouri \u2014 its people, its traditions, and its vision \u2014 remains central to the story of agricultural education in America.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4116\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/drive/1AeiSxdRJPagQcYDCi5Xm55SDKtszuXiN/lunch%20group.jpg\" width=\"279\" />Figure 5.

One last thing: This post is long and won\u2019t show up properly in your inbox. To read the whole thing, open it in your browser or the Substack app. I\u2019m a bit behind on writing this newsletter \u2014 for which I can only apologize. The truth is that I have three stories, all partially complete, ready for me to cross the finish line. My inability to do so has been, in part, because I\u2019ve felt extremely down. I\u2019ve been unable to shake the feeling that, no matter how soon the generative AI bubble bursts, so much damage has been done, and will continue to be done. Perhaps the first big blow to my mood was the reports that Amazon is preparing for a labor-free workforce \u2014 with the company believing that automation and AI will replace 600,000 workers by 2033 . To be clear, Amazon\u2019s a horrific employer \u2014 particularly for those working in delivery and fulfilment \u2014 and I don\u2019t believe that automation will be able to deliver even close to the kinds of job cuts it\u2019s aiming for, at least by those deadlines. And yet, this news served as (if we needed one) yet another reminder of the fact that big tech doesn\u2019t care about people . What We Lost  is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Then, Amazon announced swingeing 30,000 cuts to its existing workforce \u2014 which it said absolutely wasn\u2019t down to AI, or the insane capex commitments it\u2019s made to support generative AI, but because of \u201cculture.\u201d To be clear, if you decide to fire 30,000 people in one of the worst job markets in recent memory for a reason as nebulous as \u201cculture,\u201d you\u2019re a scumbag. But also, it\u2019s absolutely a lie . For the past week-and-a-half, I\u2019ve been reading through the past few years of quarterly and annual financial reports of the five companies most acutely exposed to the AI bubble \u2014 namely Oracle, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon. The research was for Ed Zitron\u2019s most recent premium article , where he calculated how much revenue these companies will need to generate exclusively from AI in order to actually make their investments worthwhile. These reports made for sobering reading. Since 2022 (but, really, since 2023), these companies have racked up hundreds of billions of dollars worth of debt and long-term lease agreements. Whether their bets on AI fail or succeed, they\u2019ll have to service these obligations \u2014 with some of them ending when I\u2019m (at least, in theory) supposed to be retired. By the end of last year, Microsoft had nearly $400bn in long-term payment obligations. That\u2019s roughly the annual GDP of Denmark. And almost all of those obligations are a consequence of its exposure to the generative AI boom. It\u2019s insane. Maddening. And there\u2019s no way that this shit isn\u2019t going to end up hurting people. Eventually, the bill comes due \u2014 and there\u2019s no way to reconcile these long-term obligations with, say, the need for companies like Microsoft and Google to pay shareholders dividends, or run share buybacks. And so, we\u2019ll see cuts and cuts. But here\u2019s the thing: it\u2019s not like Jassy, Nadella, Pichai, Zuckerberg, Altman, or any of these reprehensible toads feel even the slightest bit of emotional turmoil about what they\u2019ve done, or what they will do. I believe that these people are, at heart, bad people. I also believe that they are profoundly stupid, and through their wealth, they have alienated themselves from the human experience \u2014 meaning they are unable to understand why someone might be a bit miffed about getting fired at a time when tech hiring is non-existent, and job security means \u201cas long as it takes for an Infosys consultant to learn how to do your job.\u201d I don\u2019t say this because I\u2019m horribly prejudiced against these fabulously wealthy scumbags \u2014 though I am, and you should be too \u2014 but because their own statements reveal their motivations. Like when Sam Altman says that some of the jobs he hopes to eliminate through his technology were not, in fact, \u201creal work.\u201d It\u2019s when Dario Amodei gloats about how half of all entry-level jobs will disappear in the near future to a credulous Axios reporter , who fails to ask whether this is true (it isn\u2019t), or even the simply question of \u201cwouldn\u2019t, uh, this be really bad?\u201d It\u2019s when any tech CEO talks in a hand-waving way about AI eliminating jobs, but just shrugs and says \u201cwe\u2019ll figure it out\u201d \u2014 given that, even now, without the specter of the tech-driven annihilation of employment, we\u2019re utterly failing to provide a robust safety net. As a side note , any journalist who interviews a tech CEO who says that is obligated to ask: \u201cwell, does that mean your company is willing to pay more tax?\u201d And if that CEO represents a company that aggressively avoids tax \u2014 which, in fairness, is most of them \u2014 ask whether it\u2019s fair to expect society to pick up the tab, and not them . And if they say \u201cwe comply with all the tax laws in all of the countries in which we operate,\u201d it\u2019s your job to say, \u201cyeah, but you also use a bunch of complex tax schemes and trans-national corporate structures to limit your tax obligations, don\u2019t you?\u201d Make the bastards squirm. As I\u2019ve said again, and again, and again, big tech hates you . They do not care if your living conditions crater. Even without AI, they were happy for your kids to attend crumbling schools , to drive on pothole-pockmarked roads, and to see the functions of the state slashed, eliminating basic social goods like early-years services and cultural spending. Your value to them extends as far as your ability to consume \u2014 and no further. To be clear, I do not believe that generative AI will come close to delivering the crushing blow on employment that its boosters portend . It\u2019s just not reliable enough. The economics don\u2019t make sense. It kinda sucks . But I do believe that the disdain that big tech holds for ordinary people \u2014 and their belief that said people are, essentially, interchangeable units of labor that can be replaced at a whim, whether that\u2019s by an offshoring firm or by AI \u2014 is very real. We need some clarity here. We need to be direct. These people are happy to bring about the conditions for mass, Great Depression-style unemployment, and the only thing that\u2019s stopping them is the fact that their means of doing so isn\u2019t particularly good, and it\u2019s rather expensive to run. If generative AI fails to deliver on these aspirations, those aspirations won\u2019t go away. They\u2019ll just morph. There\u2019ll be a new technology, or a new strategy. This is what keeps me up at night. This is what I\u2019m afraid of. And it\u2019s because I know precisely what it leads to. And that\u2019s what this newsletter is all about. While I\u2019ve repeatedly emphasized the fact that I do not believe the long-term goals of the generative AI industry are even remotely achievable (these goals, I add, continuously grow grander, with OpenAI signing more than $1tn dollars in compute deals , a truly absurd number that nobody should take seriously), I also believe that we need to discuss what a tech-driven annihilation of employment actually looks like. As a Brit \u2014 and, in particular, one from Liverpool, a detail that\u2019ll become pertinent later \u2014 I know what this means. The Iron Liars As a reminder, for this piece, we\u2019re disposing our skepticism of generative AI and operating under the assumption that the predictions made by Amodei and Altman and others are, in fact, inevitable . Mass unemployment will, inevitably, be a consequence of this \u2014 and we\u2019ll talk about that later in the piece \u2014 but I feel like perhaps the biggest, and arguably most destructive, consequence will be a deepening of the stratification between the rich and poor, those with assets and those without, combined with an elimination in the ways to actually achieve economic mobility. That\u2019s the thing. Part of what I find so distasteful about the generative AI bubble is that the undercurrents driving it \u2014 the desire for the consolidation of wealth in the hands of a small few, although the current generation of shareholding-rich don\u2019t wear suits but rather Patagonia gilets, and the disdain for the economic circumstances of the poorest in society \u2014 are so old, they\u2019re boring . The economic model of generative AI is Thatcherism by another name \u2014 a failed economic experiment that, because the Iron Lady \u201c stuck it up [their] junta ,\u201d we\u2019ve failed to acknowledge was, in fact, a spectacular catastrophe with dire generational consequences. You might accuse me of reaching \u2014 trying to link my two personal b\u00eate noirs through a contrived thread \u2014 but, before you close the tab, I\u2019d ask you to think about it. Generative AI presupposes the consolidation of economic power into the hands of a small few, as wealth gravitates to those either building the models, or running the infrastructure that said models depend upon, or those that fund and own the companies that build the models. OpenAI lost $11.5bn last quarter \u2014 a truly insane number, and roughly $2bn more than Merrill Lynch lost at the height of the global financial crisis , right before it had to be rescued by Bank of America. And that loss is not, by all accounts, an outlier \u2014 and it\u2019s something that\u2019ll almost certainly continue into the near future. Anthropic spent a sum greater than the entirety of its year-to-date revenue on compute from a single provider \u2014 AWS. Add in the compute that it gets from Google Cloud, as well as its basic operational costs, and we\u2019re looking at several billion dollars in losses. And, again, there\u2019s no sign that\u2019ll change in the near future \u2014 despite the genuinely laughable projections that Anthropic has made . GPT-5 reportedly cost $500m per training run . Last year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted that by 2025, models will cost as much as $1bn to train . Despite the veneer of Anthropic and OpenAI as scrapy, disruptive startups, the reality is that they\u2019re a facade for the ambitions of their backers \u2014 which are dominated by the biggest of the big tech companies. Microsoft owns a 27% stake in the new for-profit OpenAI entity , with the possibility to increase that percentage over time, and has a revenue share agreement that sees it take 20% of everything it brings in. Anthropic\u2019s biggest stakeholders are Amazon and Google, with other big tech investors including Qualcomm and Intuit . Generative AI is legacy business, draped in the startup aesthetic. And, honestly, it reminded me of Thatcher\u2019s economic legacy. Thatcher famously privatized state-owned assets (including those that, by their very nature, were natural monopolies, like the provision of water or energy, and thus, didn\u2019t really make sense as private businesses), ostensibly to turn the British public into shareholders of the utilities that were previously owned by all \u2014 only for said utilities to eventually gravitate into the claws of larger corporations and investment funds. It was a bait-and-switch. The largest shareholder in Thames Water \u2014 the company that provides water and sewerage for much of the South-East of England, or, at least, tries to \u2014 is the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System . Anyway, here\u2019s an ad pitching shares in the various state-owned British water authorities. The largest shareholder in BT is the Indian conglomerate Bharti Airtel, followed by Deutsche Telecom. Anyway, here\u2019s Thatcher-era advert for the initial BT share sale, aimed at normal people Blackrock owns the largest stake in Centrica \u2014 the company that operates British Gas, and which made insane profits in 2022, when prices spiked forcing consumers to choose between heating their homes or eating . Anyway, here\u2019s an advert telling people to buy shares in British Gas from 1986. Council houses \u2014 which kept a lid on housing prices in the UK, until the Thatcher-era government sold them off and stopped building more \u2014 are increasingly in the hands of private developers . Anyway, here\u2019s an advert telling people to buy their council houses. All of these programs, though draped in the cloak of mass economic empowerment, were scams, each designed to benefit those already wealthy, and I see similarities in the generative AI bubble. Should generative AI become what its boosters promise, we\u2019ll see a similar gravitation of wealth. Sure, we\u2019ll be told about the \u201cnew opportunities.\u201d How anyone with an idea can vibe-code an app, allowing Brenda and Dave from next door to become a new Mark Zuckerberg, and how it\u2019ll allow people to work faster and make more money as a result. But it\u2019s all bullshit. With models costing billions of dollars to train \u2014 and that\u2019s before we mention the cost of inference \u2014 companies like Anthropic and OpenAI will essentially be the necessary feudal kings of the new economy. I say \u201cnecessary feudal kings\u201d because there\u2019s, given the operational and development costs of generative AI, the pool of companies who can possibly replace them will be vanishingly small, and they\u2019ll have to be backed by a bigger, much larger benefactor. The direction in which wealth travels will change \u2014 albeit only superficially. Whenever a Brit pays a utility bill, a chunk inevitably travels to the shareholders who now own those formerly state-owned enterprises through dividends. Brits have subsidized nearly \u00a385bn in dividends to water companies since privatization, all while the quality and cost of service has declined , and the infrastructure has crumbled to the point where human waste routinely flows into rivers, lakes, and coastal waters . Last year, the water companies discharged raw sewage into these waters 450,000 times . Altman and Amodei dream of a world where, in every economic transaction, a chunk ultimately lines their pockets, as well as the big tech companies, venture capitalists, and sovereign wealth funds that back them. Generative AI is an exercise in centralization, with the generative AI companies and cloud hyperscalers acting as the nucleus of this new economy. Every transaction, every payment, every interaction resulting in cash gravitating towards them . When Amodei talked about his vision of the first billion-dollar company with zero employees , save for the founder, what he was really describing was a world in which wealth inequality is even more stark . Forget about the lip-service that Silicon Valley pays to economic mobility \u2014 the idea that if you\u2019re an early employee, you can see your entire life transformed as your shares morph into gold \u2014 or even the RSU programs that many tech companies offer their staffers. And then we get to employment. Managed Decline We\u2019re often told that, for every job that AI displaces, another will take its place \u2014 something that begs the question \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhat will these jobs involve\u201d and \u201chow much will they pay?\u201d If the whole point of AI is to, in fact, save labor costs, the idea that this technology will create equal or similar jobs is, in fact, laughable. Are we supposed to believe that those jobs will spawn from the hellmouthes of OpenAI and Anthropic? Although these companies have, admittedly, ramped up hiring over the past few years, they\u2019re hardly labor-intensive companies. Anthropic, according to Wired, had 1,300 employees in May . In August, OpenAI had (according to The Verge) \u201croughly 3,000 employees .\u201d It\u2019s, incidentally, eyeing up an IPO that would see the company valued at $1tn \u2014 a market cap that Microsoft only reached after nearly 45 years of existence \u2014 and assuming its headcount crosses (let\u2019s be generous) 5,000, we\u2019ll have an employee to market-cap ratio of 1:200,000,000, a truly insane figure. The reason why I feel so strongly about the parallels between Thatcherism and the generative AI dream is because, even if the details differ slightly, I believe that the end outcome will ultimately be the same. Thatcher entered office in 1979 and immediately began privatizing or liquidating state-owned entities. Unemployment doubled from 1.5m when she entered office, to 2.5m in 1981, to 3m in 1982, and it remained that high until early 1987 , with a peak unemployment rate of 11.8% in 1984. The young were, of course, the most disproportionately affected \u2014 with young people accounting for roughly one-third of those unemployed . As I\u2019ve written previously, generative AI\u2019s most immediate victims in the labor force are those on the bottom rungs of the employment ladder . Admittedly, an unemployment rate of 11.8% doesn\u2019t sound too bad \u2014 it\u2019s a couple of percentage points off the US peak during the global financial crisis, and a couple of percentage points less than the Covid peak \u2014 but it\u2019s worth noting that these job losses weren\u2019t distributed equally across the country. In Northern Ireland \u2014 a nation already suffering from a prolonged sectarian civil war \u2014 one-in-five adults were unemployed . Traditional mining towns \u2014 like those in Yorkshire and Wales \u2014 faced the biggest brunt of the collapse in mining and heavy industries. In Norris Green, one of the poorest parts of Liverpool, which until recently, was the poorest city in the UK , youth unemployment was the highest in Europe . Unemployment was, essentially, centralized and concentrated into specific locations. Now, if we believe the most bullish projections for generative AI, the job losses from automation will be far worse than even the worst years of the Thatcher era. And yet, Thatcher provides a useful case study of what happens when places are subjected to long-term periods of economic decline, deprivation, and joblessness. And what\u2019s scary is that, even after a period of relative economic revival (which isn\u2019t even guaranteed, assuming the mass-automation of labor), the scars still linger. Bridgend, a mining town in Wales, suffered tremendously during the early 1980s. In 2009, it achieved global infamy for a cluster of suicides, mostly affecting young men . In 2013, it had some of the highest rates of antidepressant prescriptions in the entire UK . According to UK government statistics, some of the cities most keenly affected by Thatcher-era de-industrialization and joblessness (Port Talbot and Burnley, to give two examples), had the among highest rates of opioid deaths in 2024 \u2014 with economic deprivation strongly correlating with the rate of overdose fatalities. And then we come to my hometown. Liverpool. In the 1970s, Liverpool was a hub of manufacturing and trade. Its docks connected the UK with the Americas, and the city\u2019s factories dotted the skyline. And it was devastated by the Thatcher premiership. While this was, in part, because the UK\u2019s primary trade partners shifted after its accession to the EEC in 1973, making its docks, which faced away from Europe, less relevant, government policy played a major role. As a convinced monetarist, Thatcher raised interest rates to battle inflation \u2014 which inevitably resulted in job losses \u2014 and r educed the amounts that central government paid to local councils , forcing councils to either issue redundancies or raise local tax rates. The city haemorrhaged jobs, both in the private and public sector. By one contemporaneous analysis, Liverpool was the UK city most affected by Thatcherite economic policy . I\u2019m trying to paint a picture here. Liverpool was a city that suffered a tremendous amount, and in a relatively short amount of time. And it was very nearly destroyed. Liverpool experienced high rates of emigration, as people left to find work elsewhere in the country, or abroad. According to the 2021 census , its population was three percent lower than in 1980. Urban blight proliferated as entire streets were abandoned. In 1981, Toxteth \u2014 then the poorest ward of the UK\u2019s poorest major city, and the place I\u2019m proud to call home \u2014 was engulfed in riots, partly due to heavy-handed and racist police practices against the ward\u2019s black population, and partly due to the economic deprivation that had swallowed the city, which affected black residents hardest. Similar large-scale riots would occur in Toxteth again in 1985. Liverpool had become a headache for the Thatcher government, not least because the local government had embraced a policy of open defiance , and it was left searching for a solution. Behind the scenes, Thatcher was encouraged to simply\u2026 let the city die. Ministers close to Thatcher proposed a policy of \u201cmanaged decline,\u201d allowing the city to simply bleed jobs and residents, becoming Britain\u2019s own Detroit \u2014 a city where deindustrialization has led to entire ghost neighborhoods. \u201cIt would be even more regrettable if some of the brighter ideas for renewing economic activity were to be sown only on relatively stony ground on the banks of the Mersey,\u201d wrote Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe at the time . \u201cI cannot help feeling that the option of managed decline is one which we should not forget altogether. We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.\u201d Fortunately, this was advice that wasn\u2019t taken \u2014 although it was only after the mass inflows of EU development money, and its city\u2019s recognition as the European Capital of Culture in 2008, that Liverpool\u2019s fortunes revived. Still, the name Thatcher remains somewhat of a dirty word on Merseyside. The anger and resentment hasn\u2019t gone away, and in fact, it\u2019s passed down through the generations. Outside the ornate St George\u2019s Hall, champagne corks popped when she did, as people raised a glass to the demise of someone who caused so much harm. Similar scenes would be repeated elsewhere in the country, from Brixton and Glasgow , to the mining towns of Yorkshire, where a Thatcher effigy burned alongside a floral arrangement that read \u201cSCAB.\u201d The point I wish to stress is that you can\u2019t just destroy employment at a large scale without experiencing long-term second-order effects. Thatcher privatized or closed state-owned entities, and raised interest rates to cut inflation, resulting in a half-century of national employment rates that exceeded 10%. And what happened? Poverty. Joblessness. Mental illness. Crime. Violence. Deprivation. Urban blight. Addiction and drug-related death. And those ills didn\u2019t end when Thatcher was booted out of office, or when Tony Blair ended nearly two decades of constant Conservative rule in 1997. They still \u2014 still ! \u2014 linger. Are we so stupid to think that the same won\u2019t happen if generative AI destroys employment? Do we really think that, if we bring about the kinds of unemployment we saw during the Great Depression, we won\u2019t also see a spike in poverty? In mental ill-health? In crime? In violence? In deprivation. In urban blight? In addiction and drug-releated death? Most of my readers are American. This stuff probably sounds familiar to you, as it\u2019s exactly what happened to the Rust Belt and the Appalachia. It\u2019s no surprise that the former coal towns of West Virginia and Pennsylvania were Ground Zero for the opioid epidemic. We\u2019ve all seen pictures of empty streets and factories in Detroit, where weeds poke through the asphalt of roads that nobody ever drives down. Every country has a similar story. Belgium has Charleroi . Germany has the Ruhr . France has Marseille and its North coast. We all know what happens when economic opportunity goes away, and how even a short-term blip can have long-term, even generational consequences. As a reminder, I don\u2019t believe that generative AI will be the thing that brings about the employment apocalypse. But I do believe that Altman and Amodei are comfortable with that happening \u2014 which says everything you need to know about their characters. A Warning from History Although Thatcher\u2019s policies led to a prolonged period of mass-unemployment, the core functioning of the welfare state existed \u2014 although in a somewhat diminished form. The NHS, which provides healthcare that\u2019s free at the point of delivery, wasn\u2019t changed to a US-style system. Unemployment payments, however meager, continued to flow to those left standing on the dole queue. Can the same be said for today? The welfare state in the US is inconsistent and threadbare, and often time-limited. And even those programs that aren\u2019t time limited are vulnerable to cuts and government shutdowns \u2014 as the current disruption to SNAP payments shows . In the UK, we\u2019ve seen the emergence of a grotesque \u201cstrivers versus skivers\u201d narrative, with benefits claimants often presumed to be lazy, with their unemployment treated as a lifestyle choice rather than a product of economic circumstance. Changes made during the David Cameron years means that people can have their benefit claims suspended \u2014 or sanctioned \u2014 for prolonged periods of time, often for the most trivial of reasons. Fall ill and can\u2019t attend a meeting? Fail to pick up the phone? Late for an appointment? Too bad. You\u2019re not going to eat for the next month. If you think I\u2019m exaggerating, go on the Reddit page for welfare claimants in the UK and look up \u201csanction.\u201d Over the past couple of decades, the culture in the UK has become far less generous to those least among us. In the US, that shift probably happened earlier, and something I imagine really starting with Reagan\u2019s racist Welfare Queen trope. And so, I don\u2019t think, as a society, we\u2019re ready for mass AI-driven unemployment. What We Lost  is a reader-supported publication.

And that\u2019s without saying anything about the economics of supporting a population for whom unemployment is now an inevitable and perpetual part of life. Where\u2019s the money coming from? Seriously, if unemployment spikes to, say, 40%, and remains that high for the indefinite future, how on earth are we going to afford to support them? How on earth will we pay for their housing, or their basic costs of living? I believe that universal basic income (UBI) is a good, moral idea \u2014 and the only real solution to a world in which human labor no longer carries the value it once did \u2014 but the money for it has to come from somewhere . And while I\u2019d love to see the rich taxed until their eyes pop, I also recognize that big tech is very good at minimizing their tax liabilities . So, I ask, what happens next? I\u2019ve thought about this, and the only answer I can give is to advise you, the reader, to not be unlucky. That\u2019s the best I\u2019ve got. There but for the grace of God go I . And, for that matter, all of us. And this is not, itself, a particularly original perspective. It\u2019s essentially what Neil Kinnock, the former leader of the Labour party, and Thatcher\u2019s one-time political rival, said in 1983 on the eve of a general election that would, regrettably, see her returned to office . If Margaret Thatcher is re-elected as prime minister on Thursday, I warn you. I warn you that you will have pain\u2013when healing and relief depend upon payment. I warn you that you will have ignorance\u2013when talents are untended and wits are wasted, when learning is a privilege and not a right. I warn you that you will have poverty\u2013when pensions slip and benefits are whittled away by a government that won\u2019t pay in an economy that can\u2019t pay. I warn you that you will be cold\u2013when fuel charges are used as a tax system that the rich don\u2019t notice and the poor can\u2019t afford. I warn you that you must not expect work\u2013when many cannot spend, more will not be able to earn. When they don\u2019t earn, they don\u2019t spend. When they don\u2019t spend, work dies. I warn you not to go into the streets alone after dark or into the streets in large crowds of protest in the light. I warn you that you will be quiet\u2013when the curfew of fear and the gibbet of unemployment make you obedient. I warn you that you will have defence of a sort\u2013with a risk and at a price that passes all understanding. I warn you that you will be home-bound\u2013when fares and transport bills kill leisure and lock you up. I warn you that you will borrow less\u2013when credit, loans, mortgages and easy payments are refused to people on your melting income. If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday\u2014 I warn you not to be ordinary I warn you not to be young I warn you not to fall ill I warn you not to get old. I don\u2019t believe that generative AI will result in the kind of layoffs and redundancies and firings that Amodei and Altman have foretold \u2014 at least, not directly. Like I\u2019ve written in the past, AI provides excellent cover for outsourcing and offshoring, even if it isn\u2019t itself doing any of the work that a human once did. But what if I\u2019m wrong and they\u2019re right? Then I warn you not to be ordinary. I warn you not to be young. I warn you not to fall ill. I warn you not to get old. God help us all.

But also, it&#8217;s <em>absolutely a lie</em>.</p><p>For the past week-and-a-half, I&#8217;ve been reading through the past few years of quarterly and annual financial reports of the five companies most acutely exposed to the AI bubble &#8212; namely Oracle, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon. The <a href=\"https://www.wheresyoured.at/big-tech-2tr/\">research was for Ed Zitron&#8217;s most recent premium article</a>, where he calculated how much revenue these companies will need to generate exclusively from AI in order to actually make their investments worthwhile.</p><p>These reports made for sobering reading. Since 2022 (but, really, since 2023), these companies have racked up <em>hundreds</em> of billions of dollars worth of debt and long-term lease agreements. Whether their bets on AI fail or succeed, they&#8217;ll have to service these obligations &#8212; with some of them ending when I&#8217;m (at least, in theory) supposed to be retired.</p><p>By the end of last year, Microsoft had nearly $400bn in long-term payment obligations. That&#8217;s roughly the annual GDP of Denmark. And almost all of those obligations are a consequence of its exposure to the generative AI boom.</p><p>It&#8217;s insane. Maddening. And there&#8217;s no way that this shit isn&#8217;t going to end up hurting people. Eventually, the bill comes due &#8212; and there&#8217;s no way to reconcile these long-term obligations with, say, the need for companies like Microsoft and Google to pay shareholders dividends, or run share buybacks.</p><p>And so, we&#8217;ll see cuts and cuts.</p><p>But here&#8217;s the thing: it&#8217;s not like Jassy, Nadella, Pichai, Zuckerberg, Altman, or any of these reprehensible toads feel even the slightest bit of emotional turmoil about what they&#8217;ve done, or what they will do.</p><p>I believe that these people are, at heart, bad people. I also believe that they are profoundly stupid, and through their wealth, they <a href=\"https://www.whatwelo.st/p/these-people-are-weird\">have alienated themselves from the human experience</a> &#8212; meaning they are unable to understand why someone might be a bit miffed about getting fired at a time when tech hiring is non-existent, and job security means &#8220;as long as it takes for an Infosys consultant to learn how to do your job.&#8221;</p><p>I don&#8217;t say this because I&#8217;m horribly prejudiced against these fabulously wealthy scumbags &#8212; though I am, and you should be too &#8212; but because their own statements reveal their motivations.</p><p>Like when Sam Altman says that some of the jobs he hopes to eliminate through his technology <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/sam-altman-says-ai-could-eliminate-jobs-that-arent-real-work\">were not, in fact, &#8220;real work.&#8221;</a></p><p>It&#8217;s when Dario Amodei gloats about how <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic\">half of all entry-level jobs will disappear in the near future to a credulous Axios reporter</a>, who fails to ask whether this is true (it isn&#8217;t), or even the simply question of &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t, uh, this be really bad?&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s when any tech CEO talks in a hand-waving way about AI eliminating jobs, but just shrugs and says &#8220;we&#8217;ll figure it out&#8221; &#8212; given that, even now, <em>without</em> the specter of the tech-driven annihilation of employment, we&#8217;re utterly <em>failing</em> to provide a robust safety net.</p><blockquote><p><strong>As a side note</strong>, any journalist who interviews a tech CEO who says that is obligated to ask: &#8220;well, does that mean your company is willing to pay more tax?&#8221; And if that CEO represents a company that aggressively avoids tax &#8212; which, in fairness, is most of them &#8212; ask whether it&#8217;s fair to expect society to pick up the tab, and not <em>them</em>.</p><p>And if they say &#8220;we comply with all the tax laws in all of the countries in which we operate,&#8221; it&#8217;s your job to say, &#8220;yeah, but you also use a bunch of complex tax schemes and trans-national corporate structures to limit your tax obligations, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p><p>Make the bastards squirm.</p></blockquote><p>As I&#8217;ve said again, and again, and again, <em>big tech hates you</em>. They do not care if your living conditions crater. Even without AI, they were happy for your kids to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/12/hundreds-of-english-schools-still-at-risk-from-crumbling-concrete\">attend crumbling schools</a>, to drive on pothole-pockmarked roads, and to see the functions of the state slashed, eliminating basic social goods like early-years services and cultural spending. Your value to them extends as far as your ability to consume &#8212; and no further.</p><p>To be clear, <a href=\"https://www.whatwelo.st/p/generative-ai-is-a-paper-tiger-with\">I do not believe that generative AI will come close to delivering the crushing blow on employment that its boosters portend</a>. It&#8217;s just not reliable enough. The economics don&#8217;t make sense. <a href=\"https://www.whatwelo.st/p/generative-ais-impending-death-by\">It kinda sucks</a>.</p><p>But I do believe that <a href=\"https://www.whatwelo.st/p/they-want-to-ruin-your-life\">the disdain that big tech holds for ordinary people</a> &#8212; and their belief that said people are, essentially, interchangeable units of labor that can be replaced at a whim, whether that&#8217;s by an offshoring firm or by AI &#8212; is very real.</p><p>We need some clarity here. We need to be direct. These people are happy to bring about the conditions for mass, Great Depression-style unemployment, and the only thing that&#8217;s stopping them is the fact that their means of doing so isn&#8217;t particularly good, and it&#8217;s rather expensive to run.</p><p>If generative AI fails to deliver on these aspirations, those aspirations won&#8217;t go away. They&#8217;ll just morph. There&#8217;ll be a new technology, or a new strategy.</p><p>This is what keeps me up at night. This is what I&#8217;m afraid of. And it&#8217;s because I know precisely what it leads to.</p><p>And that&#8217;s what this newsletter is all about.</p><p>While I&#8217;ve repeatedly emphasized the fact that I <em>do not believe the long-term goals of the generative AI industry are even remotely achievable</em> (these goals, I add, continuously grow grander, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f6f78af-aed9-43a5-8e31-2df7851ceb67\">OpenAI signing more than $1tn dollars in compute deals</a>, a truly absurd number that nobody should take seriously), I also believe that we need to discuss what a tech-driven annihilation of employment actually looks like.</p><p>As a Brit &#8212; and, in particular, one from Liverpool, a detail that&#8217;ll become pertinent later &#8212; I know what this means.</p><h2>The Iron Liars</h2><p>As a reminder, for this piece, we&#8217;re disposing our skepticism of generative AI and operating under the assumption that the predictions made by Amodei and Altman and others are, in fact, <em>inevitable</em>.</p><p>Mass unemployment will, inevitably, be a consequence of this &#8212; and we&#8217;ll talk about that later in the piece &#8212; but I feel like perhaps the biggest, and arguably most destructive, consequence will be a deepening of the stratification between the rich and poor, those with assets and those without, combined with an elimination in the ways to actually achieve economic mobility.</p><p>That&#8217;s the thing. Part of what I find so distasteful about the generative AI bubble is that the undercurrents driving it &#8212; the desire for the consolidation of wealth in the hands of a small few, although the current generation of shareholding-rich don&#8217;t wear suits but rather Patagonia gilets, and the disdain for the economic circumstances of the poorest in society &#8212; are so old, <em>they&#8217;re boring</em>.</p><p>The economic model of generative AI is Thatcherism by another name &#8212; a failed economic experiment that, because the Iron Lady &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/feb/25/pressandpublishing.falklands\">stuck it up [their] junta</a>,&#8221; we&#8217;ve failed to acknowledge was, in fact, a spectacular catastrophe with <em>dire</em> generational consequences.</p><p>You might accuse me of reaching &#8212; trying to link my two personal b&#234;te noirs through a contrived thread &#8212; but, before you close the tab, I&#8217;d ask you to think about it.</p><p>Generative AI presupposes the consolidation of economic power into the hands of a small few, as wealth gravitates to those either building the models, or running the infrastructure that said models depend upon, or those that fund and own the companies that build the models.</p><p>OpenAI lost $11.5bn last <em>quarter &#8212; </em>a truly insane number, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/business/worldbusiness/17iht-merrill.4.9298820.html\">roughly $2bn more than Merrill Lynch lost at the height of the global financial crisis</a>, right before it had to be rescued by Bank of America.

But I do believe that Altman and Amodei are comfortable with that happening &#8212; which says everything you need to know about their characters.</p><h2>A Warning from History</h2><p>Although Thatcher&#8217;s policies led to a prolonged period of mass-unemployment, the core functioning of the welfare state existed &#8212; although in a somewhat diminished form. The NHS, which provides healthcare that&#8217;s free at the point of delivery, wasn&#8217;t changed to a US-style system. Unemployment payments, however meager, continued to flow to those left standing on the dole queue.</p><p>Can the same be said for today?</p><p>The welfare state in the US is inconsistent and threadbare, and often time-limited. And even those programs that aren&#8217;t time limited <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czx0e9p9nrko\">are vulnerable to cuts</a> and government shutdowns &#8212; as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions\">current disruption to SNAP payments shows</a>.</p><p>In the UK, we&#8217;ve seen the emergence of a grotesque &#8220;strivers versus skivers&#8221; narrative, with benefits claimants often presumed to be lazy, with their unemployment treated as a lifestyle choice rather than a product of economic circumstance.</p><p>Changes made during the David Cameron years means that people can have their benefit claims suspended &#8212; or sanctioned &#8212; for prolonged periods of time, often for the most trivial of reasons.</p><p>Fall ill and can&#8217;t attend a meeting? Fail to pick up the phone? Late for an appointment? Too bad. You&#8217;re not going to eat for the next month. If you think I&#8217;m exaggerating, go on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DWPhelp/\">the Reddit page for welfare claimants in the UK </a>and look up &#8220;sanction.&#8221;</p><p>Over the past couple of decades, the culture in the UK has become far less generous to those least among us. In the US, that shift probably happened earlier, and something I imagine really starting with Reagan&#8217;s racist Welfare Queen trope. And so, I don&#8217;t think, as a society, we&#8217;re ready for mass AI-driven unemployment.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">What We Lost  is a reader-supported publication.

How on earth will we pay for their housing, or their basic costs of living?</p><p>I believe that universal basic income (UBI) is a good, moral idea &#8212; and the only real solution to a world in which human labor no longer carries the value it once did &#8212; but the money for it has to come from <em>somewhere</em>. And while I&#8217;d love to see the rich taxed until their eyes pop, I also <a href=\"https://www.whatwelo.st/p/how-europe-can-win-the-war-on-big\">recognize that big tech is very good at minimizing their tax liabilities</a>.</p><p>So, I ask, what happens next?</p><p>I&#8217;ve thought about this, and the only answer I can give is to advise you, the reader, to not be unlucky. That&#8217;s the best I&#8217;ve got. <em>There but for the grace of God go I</em>. And, for that matter, all of us.</p><p>And this is not, itself, a particularly original perspective. It&#8217;s essentially what Neil Kinnock, the former leader of the Labour party, and Thatcher&#8217;s one-time political rival, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yjLr5fMX4A\">said in 1983 on the eve of a general election that would, regrettably, see her returned to office</a>.</p><blockquote><p>If Margaret Thatcher is re-elected as prime minister on Thursday, I warn you.</p><p>I warn you that you will have pain&#8211;when healing and relief depend upon payment.</p><p>I warn you that you will have ignorance&#8211;when talents are untended and wits are wasted, when learning is a privilege and not a right.</p><p>I warn you that you will have poverty&#8211;when pensions slip and benefits are whittled away by a government that won&#8217;t pay in an economy that can&#8217;t pay.</p><p>I warn you that you will be cold&#8211;when fuel charges are used as a tax system that the rich don&#8217;t notice and the poor can&#8217;t afford.</p><p>I warn you that you must not expect work&#8211;when many cannot spend, more will not be able to earn. When they don&#8217;t earn, they don&#8217;t spend. When they don&#8217;t spend, work dies.</p><p>I warn you not to go into the streets alone after dark or into the streets in large crowds of protest in the light.</p><p>I warn you that you will be quiet&#8211;when the curfew of fear and the gibbet of unemployment make you obedient.</p><p>I warn you that you will have defence of a sort&#8211;with a risk and at a price that passes all understanding.</p><p>I warn you that you will be home-bound&#8211;when fares and transport bills kill leisure and lock you up.</p><p>I warn you that you will borrow less&#8211;when credit, loans, mortgages and easy payments are refused to people on your melting income.</p><p>If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday&#8212;</p><p>I warn you not to be ordinary</p><p>I warn you not to be young</p><p>I warn you not to fall ill</p><p>I warn you not to get old.</p></blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t believe that generative AI will result in the kind of layoffs and redundancies and firings that Amodei and Altman have foretold &#8212; at least, not directly.

In the next code chunk we are going to randomly select 20% of observations and set the value to NA . We can calculate the mean and standard deviation excluding the missing values (i.e. NA s) but setting na.rm = TRUE . The mean and standard deviation are relatively close. x[ sample ( length (x), length (x) * 0.2 , replace = FALSE )] <- NA (mean2 <- mean (x, na.rm = TRUE )) [1] 0.02136184 (sd2 <- sd (x, na.rm = TRUE )) [1] 1.071757 Now we will replace the NA s we introduced above with the mean. We can see that the standard deviation is quite a bit smaller, hence reducing the variance of our estimate. Since many of our statistical tests rely on variance, reducing the variance may lead to spurious conclusions. x[ is.na (x)] <- mean (x, na.rm = TRUE ) (mean3 <- mean (x)) [1] 0.02136184 (sd3 <- sd (x)) [1] 0.9573977 To show this is not a random anomaly for our one random sample, let\u2019s repeat the above 1,000 times. n_samples <- 1000 percent_missing <- 0.10 sd_diffs <- data.frame ( sample = 1 : n_samples, sd_drop_miss = numeric (n_samples), sd_impute_miss = numeric (n_samples)) for (i in seq_len (n_samples)) { x2 <- x x2[ sample ( length (x), length (x) * percent_missing, replace = FALSE )] <- NA sd_diffs[i,] $ sd_drop_miss <- sd (x2, na.rm = TRUE ) x2[ is.na (x2)] <- mean (x2, na.rm = TRUE ) sd_diffs[i,] $ sd_impute_miss <- sd (x2) } sd_diffs |> reshape2 :: melt ( id.vars = 'sample' , variable.name = 'calculation_type' , value.name = 'sd' ) |> ggplot ( aes ( x = sd, color = calculation_type)) + geom_vline ( xintercept = sd (x)) + geom_density () + xlab ( 'Standard Deviation' ) + theme_minimal () As the figure above shows, there is a significant difference in the standard deviation estimates when calculated using only observed values and calculated with missing values imputed with the mean.

So, if you\u2019re chasing a marathon PB (personal best) time, you need to choose which Marathon to target wisely. How can we use data to help our decision? Let\u2019s use R to find out! For the impatient: just show me the marathon data! or I want to see how to code this up! Let\u2019s leave aside the fact that for the most popular marathons, it might not be your choice whether you can register. What factors do we need to consider to pick the best one? Flat course Favourable weather Travel considerations The flattest course is ideal. Any elevation gain will slow us down. We could look at finish times to know how \u201cfast\u201d the course is in practice, however the finish times really depend on who is running, and how many participants there are. It\u2019s slightly cyclical with the bigger marathons attracting faster runners. To keep things simple, I didn\u2019t use timings and went solely with elevation data. Most people would agree that running in cool temperatures, ideally dry, is best. This is why they tend to be organised in the spring and autumn. So, we need to have an idea of the likely conditions on the day. The ideal marathon would also be easy to get to. Since I am based in the UK, I made a list of popular marathons in the UK and then added the World Marathons for comparison, as well as a few others from Europe that people I know have run. For each one, I grabbed a GPX file of the route from Garmin (more on this below), and made a note of what date the last 3 editions occurred (for the weather data). Using these things, and making use of a few R libraries, I could generate graphics to compare the marathon routes. The marathon data Click on each image to enlarge it: The course profile for each race is shown on the same scale to give feel for how challenging it is. Here is the key data organised into a table, listed by date. Marathon Date Elevation gain (m) Typical max temp (\u00b0C) Tokyo 1/3/26 150 14.8 Great Welsh 8/3/26 118 11.4 Cambridge Boundary 15/3/26 158 10.4 Boston Lincs. 12/4/26 46 13.4 Brighton 12/4/26 160 13.1 Paris 12/4/26 194 14.6 Manchester 19/4/26 121 14.2 Newport 19/4/26 77 13.6 Boston 20/4/26 234 17.9 Blackpool 26/4/26 172 13.1 London 26/4/26 162 14.6 Stratford-upon-Avon 26/4/26 195 14.2 Milton Keynes 4/5/26 205 14.8 Leeds Rob Burrow 10/5/26 400 19.4 Worcester 17/5/26 296 19.6 Edinburgh 24/5/26 113 14.4 Sydney 30/8/26 369 21.8 Berlin 27/9/26 101 19.7 Chester 4/10/26 213 17 Chicago 11/10/26 105 16.2 Abingdon 18/10/26 97 15.6 Yorkshire 18/10/26 148 14.1 Amsterdam 18/10/26 174 13.8 Frankfurt 25/10/26 142 13 New York 1/11/26 179 15.2 Valencia 6/12/26 144 17.2 and here\u2019s a graphical look at the same data: Breakdown Let\u2019s face it, most marathons market themselves as flat and fast. Which ones can really make that claim The three flattest on our list are Boston (Lincs.), Newport and Abingdon. The following marathons are all less than 150 m gain and therefore pretty flat: Great Welsh, Manchester, Edinburgh, Berlin, Chicago, Yorkshire, Frankfurt, Valencia. Between 150-200 m, which is still fairly flat, we have Tokyo, Cambridge Boundary, Brighton, Paris, Blackpool, London, Stratford-upon-Avon, Amsterdam and New York. Beyond this, we are into rolling territory. Marathons with more than 200 m of elevation gain are Boston, Milton Keynes, Leeds, Worcester, Sydney and Chester. Of the flattest marathons on our list, the coolest temperatures are likely to be at Great Welsh, Frankfurt, Boston (Lincolnshire) and Newport. Whereas Berlin, Valencia and Chicago are probably the warmest. So, this gives us an idea of where the best performances can be unlocked. Data accuracy Getting the total elevation gain is difficult. I used a single data source (Garmin Connect) for the GPS data to reduce variation but even on this single source, the total gain calculated varied a lot. The elevation data for a GPS location obviously needs to be correct. This is not necessarily true if the data is taken from a watch, where the barometer could be inaccurate or where tall buildings interfere with the location (which is a problem for city marathons). If the data is correct then the calculation can still be inaccurate due to sampling frequency. If we add all the elevation gains for a track sampled every 10 metres, versus one sampled every 50 metres, we will get a different answer because the latter is smoother than the former. To deal with this, I resampled the elevation data on a uniform distance scale to get the most accurate elevation gain I could from the data I had. This caveat will be the case for whatever marathon data you will find online. So our comparison here allows us to say that one marathon has more or less elevation gain than another, but it doesn\u2019t allow us to compare elevation gain with data on another site. The weather \u201cforecast\u201d is taken by looking at the weather at the last three editions \u2013 with the exception of Valencia where the 2025 edition has not yet happened. I used the average of the max temperature on those editions. A more accurate picture would be to take a several days either side of the event because it could be that the weather on one or more of the editions was rather atypical. Finally, I manually collated the data, so errors are possible. Apologies for any mistakes! The code If you came here for the R coding rather than the running, here is the bit where I show how the analysis works! Besides general R stuff \u2013 importing data, calculations, making plots \u2013 we need to do a few other things: read the GPX data and calculate the elevation data \u2013 we\u2019ll use {gpxtoolbox} to help with this retrieve weather data \u2013 we\u2019ll use {openmeteo} for this convert WMO codes into icons, load the icons and display them We have two functions saved to a script that gets sourced during the main script. It\u2019s purpose is to convert the WMO codes into icons. I found a gist that had the WMO codes and the corresponding URLs of the day or night versions of the icons. The first function converts this data (in json format) into a data frame that we can use in the main script.

Using analyse_gpx() we read in the data from the file which includes elevation data and lat/long coordinates. We convert these to cartesian coordinates because we deal with coordinate sets from different parts of the globe. These data are used to generate the route map. The elevation data is resampled at 100 m intervals so that we get a uniform elevation measurement to calculate the total elevation gain and loss. This is used to make the elevation plot. Stats from the course can be retrieved using analyse_gpx() but, as discussed above, I recalculated the elevation data and stored this together with the other stats I needed. This saved an extra call to analyse_gpx() which sped up the execution time. Using the dates for the last three editions, I looked up the historical weather data on those dates for a location that is the midpoint of the lat/long coordinates. This was possible using {openmeteo} which is a client to use the Open-Meteo API. I found that openweathermap (which I have used for other projects) charges for access to historical weather data. Whereas Open-Meteo is truly free. Once we have this weather data we can then use the WMO code to retrieve the appropriate icon from openweathermap. These codes show the most extreme weather for the day, rather than a perfect summary. I just wanted something to signify the weather on the previous editions. The icons can be loaded from a URL using {png} . Finally, we have a wind direction which can be converted to arrows using the function above. To assemble the graphic, I used {cowplot} to assemble the graphical and text elements. Then this \u201cplot\u201d, the route and the elevation profile were put together using {patchwork} . This is done for each event and saved as a file. The summary data gets stored as we go so that we can make the table and the plot, which were shown above in the post. Conclusion I\u2019m quite happy with the result(s) but I can see a few ways to improve it. For example, I think having a more sophisticated measure of marathon toughness would be good. I also could use some custom fonts and improve the colours of the graphics to get a more professional look. Anyway, the purpose was to figure out which marathon to run in 2026 and I have been able to do that. \u2014 The post title comes from Choose Your Fighter by The Nova Twins.

        "raw_html": "<p>Running a marathon is a big deal. It takes a lot of time to train to run a good time, and it takes a while to recover. So, if you&#8217;re chasing a marathon PB (personal best) time, you need to choose which Marathon to target wisely. <strong>How can we use data to help our decision?</strong> Let&#8217;s use R to find out!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the impatient: <a href=\"#the-data\">just show me the marathon data!</a> or <a href=\"#the-code\">I want to see how to code this up!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s leave aside the fact that for the most popular marathons, it might not be your choice whether you can register. What factors do we need to consider to pick the best one?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Flat course</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Favourable weather</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Travel considerations</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The flattest course is ideal. Any elevation gain will slow us down. We could look at finish times to know how &#8220;fast&#8221; the course is in practice, however the finish times really depend on who is running, and how many participants there are. It&#8217;s slightly cyclical with the bigger marathons attracting faster runners. To keep things simple, I didn&#8217;t use timings and went solely with elevation data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people would agree that running in cool temperatures, ideally dry, is best. This is why they tend to be organised in the spring and autumn. So, we need to have an idea of the likely conditions on the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ideal marathon would also be easy to get to. Since I am based in the UK, I made a list of popular marathons in the UK and then added the World Marathons for comparison, as well as a few others from Europe that people I know have run. For each one, I grabbed a GPX file of the route from Garmin (more on this below), and made a note of what date the last 3 editions occurred (for the weather data). Using these things, and making use of a few R libraries, I could generate graphics to compare the marathon routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-data\">The marathon

Which ones can really make that claim</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three flattest on our list are Boston (Lincs.), Newport and Abingdon. The following marathons are all less than 150 m gain and therefore pretty flat: Great Welsh, Manchester, Edinburgh, Berlin, Chicago, Yorkshire, Frankfurt, Valencia. Between 150-200 m, which is still fairly flat, we have Tokyo, Cambridge Boundary, Brighton, Paris, Blackpool, London, Stratford-upon-Avon, Amsterdam and New York. Beyond this, we are into rolling territory. Marathons with more than 200 m of elevation gain are Boston, Milton Keynes, Leeds, Worcester, Sydney and Chester.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the flattest marathons on our list, the coolest temperatures are likely to be at Great Welsh, Frankfurt, Boston (Lincolnshire) and Newport. Whereas Berlin, Valencia and Chicago are probably the warmest. So, this gives us an idea of where the best performances can be unlocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data accuracy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting the total elevation gain is difficult. I used a single data source (Garmin Connect) for the GPS data to reduce variation but even on this single source, the total gain calculated varied a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3591\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://quantixed.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-1-851x1024.png\" width=\"851\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The elevation data for a GPS location obviously needs to be correct. This is not necessarily true if the data is taken from a watch, where the barometer could be inaccurate or where tall buildings interfere with the location (which is a problem for city marathons).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the data is correct then the calculation can still be inaccurate due to sampling frequency. If we add all the elevation gains for a track sampled every 10 metres, versus one sampled every 50 metres, we will get a different answer because the latter is smoother than the former. To deal with this, I resampled the elevation data on a uniform distance scale to get the most accurate elevation gain I could from the data I had. This caveat will be the case for whatever marathon data you will find online. So our comparison here allows us to say that one marathon has more or less elevation gain than another, but it doesn&#8217;t allow us to compare elevation gain with data on another site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weather &#8220;forecast&#8221; is taken by looking at the weather at the last three editions &#8211; with the exception of Valencia where the 2025 edition has not yet happened. I used the average of the max temperature on those editions. A more accurate picture would be to take a several days either side of the event because it could be that the weather on one or more of the editions was rather atypical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I manually collated the data, so errors are possible. Apologies for any mistakes!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-code\">The code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you came here for the R coding rather than the running, here is the bit where I show how the analysis works! Besides general R stuff &#8211; importing data, calculations, making plots &#8211; we need to do a few other things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>read the GPX data and calculate the elevation data &#8211; we&#8217;ll use <code>{gpxtoolbox}</code> to help with this</li>\n\n\n\n<li>retrieve weather data &#8211; we&#8217;ll use <code>{openmeteo}</code> for this</li>\n\n\n\n<li>convert WMO codes into icons, load the icons and display them</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We have two functions saved to a script that gets sourced during the main script. It&#8217;s purpose is to convert the WMO codes into icons. I found a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/stellasphere/9490c195ed2b53c707087c8c2db4ec0c\">gist</a> that had the WMO codes and the corresponding URLs of the day or night versions of the icons. The first function converts this data (in json format) into a data frame that we can use in the main script. The second function converts the wind direction into a text arrow for display.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\">\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(tibble)\n\n# Example: read the JSON into `lst`\n# lst &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(&quot;Data/descriptions.json&quot;, simplifyVector = FALSE)\n\ndescriptions_to_df &lt;- function(lst) {\n  # lst is expected to be a named list or a list of entries where each element corresponds to a WMO code.\n  # Support either:\n  #  - named list where names(lst) are WMO codes and each element is a list with day/night fields\n  #  - or a list of objects where each object has a &quot;wmo&quot;

I had the marathon event list in tab-separated format as a file in the <code>Data</code> directory and a gpx file for each marathon in the same directory. The name of the gpx file is the same as the event name. The event list also had an alias for display of the marathon name.

Using <code>analyse_gpx()</code> we read in the data from the file which includes elevation data and lat/long coordinates. We convert these to cartesian coordinates because we deal with coordinate sets from different parts of the globe. These data are used to generate the route map. The elevation data is resampled at 100 m intervals so that we get a uniform elevation measurement to calculate the total elevation gain and loss. This is used to make the elevation plot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stats from the course can be retrieved using <code>analyse_gpx()</code> but, as discussed above, I recalculated the elevation data and stored this together with the other stats I needed. This saved an extra call to <code>analyse_gpx()</code> which sped up the execution time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the dates for the last three editions, I looked up the historical weather data on those dates for a location that is the midpoint of the lat/long coordinates. This was possible using <code>{openmeteo}</code> which is a client to use the Open-Meteo API. I found that openweathermap (which I have used for other projects) charges for access to historical weather data. Whereas Open-Meteo is truly free. Once we have this weather data we can then use the WMO code to retrieve the appropriate icon from openweathermap. These codes show the most extreme weather for the day, rather than a perfect summary. I just wanted something to signify the weather on the previous editions. The icons can be loaded from a URL using <code>{png}</code>. Finally, we have a wind direction which can be converted to arrows using the function above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To assemble the graphic, I used <code>{cowplot}</code> to assemble the graphical and text elements. Then this &#8220;plot&#8221;, the route and the elevation profile were put together using <code>{patchwork}</code>. This is done for each event and saved as a file. The summary data gets stored as we go so that we can make the table and the plot, which were shown above in the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m quite happy with the result(s) but I can see a few ways to improve it. For example, I think having a more sophisticated measure of marathon toughness would be good. I also could use some custom fonts and improve the colours of the graphics to get a more professional look. Anyway, the purpose was to figure out which marathon to run in 2026 and I have been able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post title comes from Choose Your Fighter by The Nova Twins.

The CPI from the BLS measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of consumer goods and services. Over the years , the BLS has improved the official CPI by updating samples and weights, expanding coverage, and enhancing how it calculates the numbers. Sometimes the BLS also produces experimental versions to explore alternative methodologies. One of these experiments is the harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP). Our FRED graph above shows the year-over-year inflation rate measured by each of these indexes. They differ in a\u00a0 few ways. Solid blue line: The CPI inflation rate estimates price changes for the noninstitutional urban population. It doesn\u2019t include the rural/nonmetropolitan population in its coverage, due largely to the difficulty involved in sampling the remote and sparsely populated areas of the country. Dashed green line: The HICP inflation rate estimates price changes for the entire population, both urban and rural. And, unlike the CPI, it excludes cost measures of owner-occupied housing. (Learn more about how CPI measures housing inflation .) Despite the methodological differences between the CPI and HICP, both price indexes generally yield very similar inflation rates. The most visible differences are noticeable during times of heightened inflation volatility, such as the Great Recession of 2007-2009 and the post-Covid inflation ramp-up and slow-down from 2021 to 2024.

Ted Cruz\u2019s thinking implies there\u2019s something dangerous about advocating for the end of private control over productive capacities. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images) For months, Zohran Mamdani\u2019s critics have gnashed their teeth over his self-identification as a democratic socialist, an ideology they consider beyond the pale. Their attacks didn\u2019t work; Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race without backing down, even reiterating his socialist affiliation in his victory speech . So now, his critics are upping the ante. Last week on Fox News, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) claimed that Mamdani isn\u2019t a socialist at all. Instead, Cruz said, he\u2019s something far worse. He\u2019s a Marxist . The senator is very confused. First, he badly misunderstands what Marxism is. When Mamdani \u201cargues for government seizing the means of production in society,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cthat is Marxism.\u201d Cruz is harking back to an earlier bout of right-wing hysteria about Mamdani that broke out last summer, when an old clip emerged of the future mayor at a Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) conference in 2021. In the clip , Mamdani mentions various short-term reforms favored by YDSA and its parent organization, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). But he also mentions the long-term \u201cend goal\u201d of \u201cseizing the means of production.\u201d To the extent that any sense can be squeezed out of Cruz\u2019s alarmism, his idea seems to be something like this: Normal, mainstream democratic socialists might want to implement doses of socialism within a fundamentally capitalist framework, like a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system of single-payer public health insurance . But the end goal of going beyond capitalism entirely is only advocated by crazy marginal extremists, and Marxism is a word that describes that extreme. This is just plain incorrect. All socialists want private ownership of things like factories, banks, and hospitals to eventually end. Marxism is indeed a variant of socialist thought, but it\u2019s not a more extreme variant. It\u2019s a particular theoretical framework for thinking about systems like capitalism and socialism \u2014\u00a0their internal economic and political dynamics, and how they rise and fall over the course of history. Karl Marx and his close collaborator Friedrich Engels called the framework they developed \u201cscientific socialism\u201d since they grounded their ideas about how socialism could be achieved in a social-scientific analysis of capitalism. But the non-Marxist socialists of their day (e.g., the \u201cutopian socialists\u201d) had the same end goal of socializing the means of production. All socialists do; it\u2019s the definition of the term. The second problem with Cruz\u2019s thinking is that it implies there\u2019s something dangerous and spooky about advocating for the end of private control over productive capacities, as though holding this view were synonymous with fringe political extremism. In fact, mainstream socialist parties all over the world advocated the end goal of socialism until very recently. Socialist parties \u2014 and in particular democratic socialist parties with a strategy informed by a Marxist analysis of material conditions \u2014 have long sought to achieve their aims through entirely above-board means. And they have not been secretive about those aims, maintaining that advocating capitalism\u2019s end is no more \u201cextreme\u201d than advocating its continuation. In the UK, for example, the original version of Clause IV of the Labour Party\u2019s constitution committed the party to \u201csecure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.\u201d During the nearly eighty years when this was in the Labour Party constitution, there were many Labour mayors of cities like London and Manchester. They mostly did things like build large-scale council housing estates , bring utilities and transport under municipal ownership or control, expand public health and sanitation services, create public parks , and use wage policy and social programs to raise working-class living standards. Mainstream socialist parties in many European and Latin American countries had similar long-term horizons, which they defended and took seriously as they implemented short-term reforms. In Sweden, the ruling Social Democrats even made an abortive attempt to move toward that long-term end goal in 1975, with the \u201cMeidner Plan\u201d that would have required companies over a certain size to cede a certain portion of their ownership shares every year to funds controlled by workers. That effort was politically defeated at the time, but it was a glimpse at one way that a society that had already achieved many short-term reformist goals might try to go beyond capitalist ownership relations. The Overton Window Shifts To be generous to Cruz, his confusion might be partly explained by the fact that the tradition outlined above has been suppressed for half a century. Many countries no longer have mainstream socialist parties that tie their minimum program of reform to a maximum program of social transformation. He can perhaps be forgiven, then, for having no clue what he\u2019s talking about. The Labour Party, for example, dropped Clause IV in the 1990s. It was the subject of much debate. The argument in favor of keeping it was made well by the Marxist philosopher G. A. Cohen, who observed that it didn\u2019t make much sense to say the party cared about equality while rejecting its commitment to the socialist end goal. He wrote: In the capitalist division, some live by virtue of their participation in the creation of social wealth, while others live by virtue of their ownership or control of that wealth, and, therefore, on the backs of those who create it. No one can call that division a form of equality. But the division between capital and labor is generated by private ownership of means of production. And the only alternative to private ownership of the means of production is common ownership of the means of production. . . . There is no third possibility. Cohen and other socialists lost that debate. And they weren\u2019t alone: Labour\u2019s abandonment of its long-term commitments in the 1990s was part of a global process by which the whole spectrum of mainstream discourse about economics was shifting to the right. Here in the United States, neither of our mainstream parties ever supported socialism in the first place, but at the same time that Tony Blair\u2019s Labour Party was abandoning any pretense of a commitment to socialism, Bill Clinton\u2019s Democrats were abandoning their support for the New Deal order and declaring that \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d Blair and Clinton were champions of a general shift in how capitalism was managed called neoliberalism. It was a revival (hence \u201cneo\u201d) of an older and more \u201cliberalized\u201d form of capitalism \u2014\u00a0one, in other words, where employers faced less interference from labor unions and the regulatory and welfare states. It manifested in things like the privatization of railways in the UK, Clinton\u2019s brutal welfare reform in the United States, and the widespread adoption of trade treaties that made it easier for corporations to hop from nation to nation in search of lower wages. If we think of neoliberalism as a kind of global social experiment, the results of that experiment have long since come in. It\u2019s made the lives of vast numbers of human beings far more miserable and precarious. Little wonder, then, that older forms of left politics are being revived today by democratic socialists like Mamdani. Don\u2019t let the Cruzes of the world scare you with visions of radical extremism and Soviet breadlines in Manhattan. A left politics that aims to make policy shifts that benefit the working class here and now, and sets its long-term sights at changing the economic foundations of society through common ownership and democratic control of society\u2019s productive resources, isn\u2019t foreign to the mainstream socialist tradition. It\u2019s the historical core of that tradition.",

To connect to InfluxDB from R,\nI thought I can use the <code>influxdbr</code> package. But I got some errors because\nthis package seems to be outdated.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I get, when fetching data:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><div class=\"chroma\">\n<table

Not everything has to be AI.\n\nIn order to validate or push such a thing in prod, you typically need GitHub Actions and a set of objective rules ( e.g what 's a critical warning, or a critical note, if there' s such a thing... ) . It 's not even AI (see e.g https://github.com/Techtonique/techtonique-r-pkgs). \n\nTypically, since submitting this package to your highest authority, I' ve shipped ~5 packages to PyPI ( within minutes, and they also check if the code is malicious, or it will be removed ) without being bothered by gatekeeping ( \"this comma is missing\" , \"oh english grammar requires a full stop there\" ) . And this is not an insult, it 's food for thought (if you' re humble enough to accept it ) , when Python is eating R at breakfast everyday. \n\nR seems to be stuck somewhere in a very distant past with discussions like this. That\u2019s the comment of a foolish guy. If that is foolishness , I want to be foolish forever. The package, unifiedml , provides a consistent interface for machine learning in R, making it easier to work with different ML algorithms using a unified API. Why unifiedml ? R has an incredibly rich ecosystem of machine learning packages, but each comes with its own syntax and conventions. unifiedml is an effort to bridge this gap by providing: Extremely lightweight (see for yourself: https://github.com/Techtonique/unifiedml/blob/main/R/model.R ) and consistent API across different ML algorithms Automatic task detection (regression vs classification) Built-in cross-validation with appropriate metrics Model interpretation tools including feature importance and partial dependence plots Seamless integration with existing R packages (once installed) like glmnet, randomForest, and more Installation install.packages ( \"unifiedml\" , repos = \"https://cran.r-project.org/\" ) library ( unifiedml ) Quick Start: Regression Example Here\u2019s how easy it is to build a regression model: library ( glmnet ) data ( mtcars ) # Prepare data X <- as.matrix ( mtcars [, -1 ]) y <- mtcars $ mpg # numeric \u2192 automatic regression # Fit model mod <- Model $ new ( glmnet :: glmnet ) mod $ fit ( X , y , alpha = 0 , lambda = 0.1 ) # Make predictions predictions <- mod $ predict ( X ) # Get model summary with feature importance mod $ summary () # Visualize partial dependence mod $ plot ( feature = 1 ) # Cross-validation (automatically uses RMSE for regression) cv_scores <- cross_val_score ( mod , X , y , cv = 5 ) cat ( \"Mean RMSE:\" , mean ( cv_scores ), \"\\n\" ) Quick Start: Classification Example The same intuitive API works for classification: library ( randomForest ) data ( iris ) # Prepare data X <- as.matrix ( iris [, 1 : 4 ]) y <- iris $ Species # factor \u2192 automatic classification # Fit model mod <- Model $ new ( randomForest :: randomForest ) mod $ fit ( X , y , ntree = 100 ) # Make predictions predictions <- mod $ predict ( X ) # Cross-validation (automatically uses accuracy for classification) cv_scores <- cross_val_score ( mod , X , y , cv = 5 ) cat ( \"Mean Accuracy:\" , mean ( cv_scores ), \"\\n\" ) Key Features Consistent Interface\nWhether you\u2019re using glmnet, randomForest, xgboost, or any other compatible algorithm, the interface remains the same. This makes it easy to: Switch between algorithms Compare model performance Build reproducible workflows Automatic Task Detection\nNo need to specify whether you\u2019re doing regression or classification\u2014unifiedml automatically detects this based on your target variable type. Model Interpretation (in progress)\nBuilt-in tools for understanding your models:\nFeature importance rankings\nPartial dependence plots\nComprehensive model summaries Note unifiedml is still very young, so there might be some rough edges. The package will mature over time as I refine the lightweight API (see for yourself: https://github.com/Techtonique/unifiedml/blob/main/R/model.R ), expand functionality, and incorporate user feedback.

        "full_content": "From DeepSeek R1 to MiniMax-M2, the largest and most capable open-weight LLMs today remain autoregressive decoder-style transformers, which are built on flavors of the original multi-head attention mechanism. However, we have also seen alternatives to standard LLMs popping up in recent years, from text diffusion models to the most recent linear attention hybrid architectures. Some of them are geared towards better efficiency, and others, like code world models, aim to improve modeling performance. After I shared my Big LLM Architecture Comparison a few months ago, which focused on the main transformer-based LLMs, I received a lot of questions with respect to what I think about alternative approaches. (I also recently gave a short talk about that at the PyTorch Conference 2025, where I also promised attendees to follow up with a write-up of these alternative approaches). So here it is! Figure 1: Overview of the LLM landscape. This article covers those architectures surrounded by the black frames. The decoder-style transformers are covered in my \u201cThe Big Architecture Comparison\u201d article. Other non-framed architectures may be covered in future articles. Note that ideally each of these topics shown in the figure above would deserve at least a whole article itself (and hopefully get it in the future). So, to keep this article at a reasonable length, many sections are reasonably short. However, I hope this article is still useful as an introduction to all the interesting LLM alternatives that emerged in recent years. PS: The aforementioned PyTorch conference talk will be uploaded to the official PyTorch YouTube channel. In the meantime, if you are curious, you can find a practice recording version below. (There is also a YouTube version here .) 1. Transformer-Based LLMs Transformer-based LLMs based on the classic Attention Is All You Need architecture are still state-of-the-art across text and code. If we just consider some of the highlights from late 2024 to today, notable models include DeepSeek V3/R1 OLMo 2 Gemma 3 Mistral Small 3.1 Llama 4 Qwen3 SmolLM3 Kimi K2 gpt-oss GLM-4.5 GLM-4.6 MiniMax-M2 and many more. (The list above focuses on the open-weight models; there are proprietary models like GPT-5, Grok 4, Gemini 2.5, etc. that also fall into this category.) Figure 2: An overview of the most notable decoder-style transformers released in the past year. Since I talked and wrote about transformer-based LLMs so many times, I assume you are familiar with the broad idea and architecture. If you\u2019d like a deeper coverage, I compared the architectures listed above (and shown in the figure below) in my The Big LLM Architecture Comparison article. (Side note: I could have grouped Qwen3-Next and Kimi Linear with the other transformer-state space model (SSM) hybrids in the overview figure. Personally, I see these other transformer-SSM hybrids as SSMs with transformer components, whereas I see the models discussed here (Qwen3-Next and Kimi Linear) as transformers with SSM components. However, since I have listed IBM Granite 4.0 and NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 2 in the transformer-SSM box, an argument could be made for putting them into a single category.) Figure 3. A subset of the architectures discussed in my The Big Architecture Comparison (https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/the-big-llm-architecture-comparison) article. If you are working with or on LLMs, for example, building applications, fine-tuning models, or trying new algorithms, I would make these models my go-to. They are tested, proven, and perform well. Moreover, as discussed in the The Big Architecture Comparison article, there are many efficiency improvements, including grouped-query attention, sliding-window attention, multi-head latent attention, and others. However, it would be boring (and shortsighted) if researchers and engineers didn\u2019t work on trying alternatives. So, the remaining sections will cover some of the interesting alternatives that emerged in recent years. 2. (Linear) Attention Hybrids Before we discuss the \u201cmore different\u201d approaches, let\u2019s first look at transformer-based LLMs that have adopted more efficient attention mechanisms. In particular, the focus is on those that scale linearly rather than quadratically with the number of input tokens. There\u2019s recently been a revival in linear attention mechanisms to improve the efficiency of LLMs. The attention mechanism introduced in the Attention Is All You Need paper (2017), aka scaled-dot-product attention, remains the most popular attention variant in today\u2019s LLMs. Besides traditional multi-head attention, it\u2019s also used in the more efficient flavors like grouped-query attention, sliding window attention, and multi-head latent attention as discussed in my talk . 2.1 Traditional Attention and Quadratic Costs The original attention mechanism scales quadratically with the sequence length: This is because the query (Q), key (K), and value (V) are n -by- d matrices, where d is the embedding dimension (a hyperparameter) and n is the sequence length (i.e., the number of tokens). (You can find more details in my Understanding and Coding Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention, Causal-Attention, and Cross-Attention in LLMs article ) Figure 4: Illustration of the traditional scaled-dot-product attention mechanism in multi-head attention; the quadratic cost in attention due to sequence length n. 2.2 Linear attention Linear attention variants have been around for a long time, and I remember seeing tons of papers in the 2020s. For example, one of the earliest I recall is the 2020 Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention paper, where the researchers approximated the attention mechanism: Here, \u03d5(\u22c5) is a kernel feature function, set to \u03d5(x) = elu(x)+1. This approximation is efficient because it avoids explicitly computing the n\u00d7n attention matrix QK T . I don\u2019t want to dwell too long on these older attempts. But the bottom line was that they reduced both time and memory complexity from O(n 2 ) to O(n) to make attention much more efficient for long sequences. However, they never really gained traction as they degraded the model accuracy, and I have never really seen one of these variants applied in an open-weight state-of-the-art LLM. 2.3 Linear Attention Revival In the second half of this year, there has been revival of linear attention variants, as well as a bit of a back-and-forth from some model developers as illustrated in the figure below. Figure 5: An overview of the linear attention hybrid architectures. The first notable model was MiniMax-M1 with lightning attention. MiniMax-M1 is a 456B parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 46B active parameters, which came out back in June. Then, in August, the Qwen3 team followed up with Qwen3-Next, which I discussed in more detail above. Then, in September, the DeepSeek Team announced DeepSeek V3.2 . (DeepSeek V3.2 sparse attention mechanism is not strictly linear but at least subquadratic in terms of computational costs, so I think it\u2019s fair to put it into the same category as MiniMax-M1, Qwen3-Next, and Kimi Linear.) All three models (MiniMax-M1, Qwen3-Next, DeepSeek V3.2) replace the traditional quadratic attention variants in most or all of their layers with efficient linear variants. Interestingly, there was a recent plot twist, where the MiniMax team released their new 230B parameter M2 model without linear attention, going back to regular attention. The team stated that linear attention is tricky in production LLMs. It seemed to work fine with regular prompts, but it had poor accuracy in reasoning and multi-turn tasks, which are not only important for regular chat sessions but also agentic applications. This could have been a turning point where linear attention may not be worth pursuing after all. However, it gets more interesting. In October, the Kimi team released their new Kimi Linear model with linear attention. For this linear attention aspect, both Qwen3-Next and Kimi Linear adopt a Gated DeltaNet, which I wanted to discuss in the next few sections as one example of a hybrid attention architecture. 2.4 Qwen3-Next Let\u2019s start with Qwen3-Next, which replaced the regular attention mechanism by a Gated DeltaNet + Gated Attention hybrid, which helps enable the native 262k token context length in terms of memory usage (the previous 235B-A22B model model supported 32k natively, and 131k with YaRN scaling.) Their hybrid mechanism mixes Gated DeltaNet blocks with Gated Attention blocks within a 3:1 ratio as shown in the figure below. Figure 6: Qwen3-Next with gated attention and Gated DeltaNet. As depicted in the figure above, the attention mechanism is either implemented as gated attention or Gated DeltaNet. This simply means the 48 transformer blocks (layers) in this architecture alternate between this. Specifically, as mentioned earlier, they alternate in a 3:1 ratio. For instance, the transformer blocks are as follows: \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nLayer 1 : Linear attention \u2192 MoE\nLayer 2 : Linear attention \u2192 MoE\nLayer 3 : Linear attention \u2192 MoE\nLayer 4 : Full attention \u2192 MoE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nLayer 5 : Linear attention \u2192 MoE\nLayer 6 : Linear attention \u2192 MoE\nLayer 7 : Linear attention \u2192 MoE\nLayer 8 : Full attention \u2192 MoE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n... Otherwise, the architecture is pretty standard and similar to Qwen3: Figure 7: A previous \u201cregular\u201d Qwen3 model (left) next to Qwen3-Next (right). So, what are gated attention and Gated DeltaNet? 2.5 Gated Attention Before we get to the Gated DeltaNet itself, let\u2019s briefly talk about the gate. As you can see in the upper part of the Qwen3-Next architecture in the previous figure, Qwen3-Next uses \u201cgated attention\u201d. This is essentially regular full attention with an additional sigmoid gate. This gating is a simple modification that I added to an MultiHeadAttention implementation (based on code from chapter 3 of my LLMs from Scratch book ) below for illustration purposes: As we can see, after computing attention as usual, the model uses a separate gating signal from the same input, applies a sigmoid to keep it between 0 and 1, and multiplies it with the attention output. This allows the model to scale up or down certain features dynamically. The Qwen3-Next developers state that this helps with training stability: [...] the attention output gating mechanism helps eliminate issues like Attention Sink and Massive Activation, ensuring numerical stability across the model. In short, gated attention modulates the output of standard attention. In the next section, we discuss Gated DeltaNet, which replaces the attention mechanism itself with a recurrent delta-rule memory update. 2.6 Gated DeltaNet Now, what is Gated DeltaNet? Gated DeltaNet (short for Gated Delta Network ) is Qwen3-Next\u2019s linear-attention layer, which is intended as an alternative to standard softmax attention. It was adopted from the Gated Delta Networks: Improving Mamba2 with Delta Rule paper as mentioned earlier. Gated DeltaNet was originally proposed as an improved version of Mamba2, where it combines the gated decay mechanism of Mamba2 with a delta rule. Mamba is a state-space model (an alternative to transformers), a big topic that deserves separate coverage in the future. The delta rule part refers to computing the difference (delta, \u0394) between new and predicted values to update a hidden state that is used as a memory state (more on that later). (Side note: Readers with classic machine learning literature can think of this as similar to Hebbian learning inspired by biology: \u201cCells that fire together wire together.\u201d It\u2019s basically a precursor of the perceptron update rule and gradient descent-based learning, but without supervision.) Gated DeltaNet has a gate similar to the gate in gated attention discussed earlier, except that it uses a SiLU instead of logistic sigmoid activation, as illustrated below. (The SiLU choice is likely to improve gradient flow and stability over the standard sigmoid.) Figure 8: Gated attention compared to Gated DeltaNet. However, as shown in the figure above, next to the output gate, the \u201cgated\u201d in the Gated DeltaNet also refers to several additional gates: \u03b1 (decay gate) controls how fast the memory decays or resets over time, \u03b2 (update gate) controls how strongly new inputs modify the state. In code, a simplified version of the Gated DeltaNet depicted above (without the convolutional mixing) can be implemented as follows (the code is inspired by the official implementation by the Qwen3 team): (Note that for simplicity, I omitted the convolutional mixing that Qwen3-Next and Kimi Linear use to keep the code more readable and focus on the recurrent aspects.) So, as we can see above, there are lots of differences to standard (or gated) attention. In gated attention, the model computes normal attention between all tokens (every token attends or looks at every other token). Then, after getting the attention output, a gate (a sigmoid) decides how much of that output to keep. The takeaway is that it\u2019s still the regular scaled-dot product attention that scales quadratically with the context length. As a refresher, scaled-dot product attention is computed as softmax(QK\u1d40)V, where Q and K are n -by- d matrices, where n is the number of input tokens, and d is the embedding dimension. So QK\u1d40 results in an attention n -by- n matrix, that is multiplied by an n -by- d dimensional value matrix V . Figure 9: The traditional attention mechanism (again), which scales with the number of tokens n . In Gated DeltaNet, there\u2019s no n -by- n attention matrix. Instead, the model processes tokens one by one. It keeps a running memory (a state) that gets updated as each new token comes in. This is what\u2019s implemented as, where S is the state that gets updated recurrently for each time step t . And the gates control how that memory changes: \u03b1 (alpha) regulates how much of the old memory to forget (decay). \u03b2 (beta) regulates how much the current token at time step t updates the memory. (And the final output gate, not shown in the snippet above, is similar to gated attention; it controls how much of the output is kept.) So, in a sense, this state update in Gated DeltaNet is similar to how recurrent neural networks (RNNs) work. The advantage is that it scales linearly (via the for-loop) instead of quadratically with context length. The downside of this recurrent state update is that, compared to regular (or gated) attention, it sacrifices the global context modeling ability that comes from full pairwise attention. Gated DeltaNet, can, to some extend, still capture context, but it has to go through the memory ( S ) bottleneck. That memory is a fixed size and thus more efficient, but it compresses past context into a single hidden state similar to RNNs. That\u2019s why the Qwen3-Next and Kimi Linear architectures don\u2019t replace all attention layers with DeltaNet layers but use the 3:1 ratio mentioned earlier. 2.7 DeltaNet Memory Savings In the previous section, we discussed the advantage of the DeltaNet over full attention in terms of linear instead of quadratic compute complexity with respect to the context length. Next to the linear compute complexity, another big advantage of DeltaNet is the memory savings, as DeltaNet modules don\u2019t grow the KV cache. (For more information about KV caching, see my Understanding and Coding the KV Cache in LLMs from Scratch article). Instead, as mentioned earlier, they keep a fixed-size recurrent state, so memory stays constant with context length. For a regular multi-head attention (MHA) layer, we can compute the KV cache size as follows: KV_cache_MHA \u2248 batch_size \u00d7 n_tokens \u00d7 n_heads \u00d7 d_head \u00d7 2 \u00d7 bytes (The 2 multiplier is there because we have both keys and values that we store in the cache.) For the simplified DeltaNet version implemented above, we have: KV_cache_DeltaNet = batch_size \u00d7 n_heads \u00d7 d_head \u00d7 d_head \u00d7 bytes Note that the KV_cache_DeltaNet memory size doesn\u2019t have a context length ( n_tokens ) dependency. Also, we have only the memory state S that we store instead of separate keys and values, hence 2 \u00d7 bytes becomes just bytes. However, note that we now have a quadratic d_head \u00d7 d_head in here. This comes from the state: S = x.new_zeros(b, self.num_heads, self.head_dim, self.head_dim) But that\u2019s usually nothing to worry about, as the head dimension is usually relatively small. For instance, it\u2019s 128 in Qwen3-Next. The full version with the convolutional mixing is a bit more complex, including the kernel size and so on, but the formulas above should illustrate the main trend and motivation behind the Gated DeltaNet. Figure 10: A comparison of the growing KV cache size. The 3:1 ratio refers to the ratio of Gated DeltaNet to full attention layers. The calculation assumes emb_dim=2048, n_heads=16, n_layers=48, bf16. You can find the code to reproduce this here: https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch04/08_deltanet. 2.8 Kimi Linear vs. Qwen3-Next Kimi Linear shares several structural similarities with Qwen3-Next. Both models rely on a hybrid attention strategy. Concretely, they combine lightweight linear attention with heavier full attention layers. Specifically, both use a 3:1 ratio, meaning for every three transformer blocks employing the linear Gated DeltaNet variant, there\u2019s one block that uses full attention as shown in the figure below. Figure 11: Qwen3-Next and Kimi Linear side by side. Gated DeltaNet is a linear attention variant with inspiration from recurrent neural networks, including a gating mechanism from the Gated Delta Networks: Improving Mamba2 with Delta Rule paper. In a sense, Gated DeltaNet is a DeltaNet with Mamba-style gating, and DeltaNet is a linear attention mechanism (more on that in the next section) The MLA in Kimi Linear, depicted in the upper right box in the Figure 11 above, does not use the sigmoid gate.This omission was intentional so that the authors could compare the architecture more directly to standard MLA, however, they stated that they plan to add it in the future. Also note that the omission of the RoPE box in the Kimi Linear part of the figure above is intentional as well. Kimi applies NoPE (No Positional Embedding) in multi-head latent attention MLA) layers (global attention). As the authors state, this lets MLA run as pure multi-query attention at inference and avoids RoPE retuning for long\u2011context scaling (the positional bias is supposedly handled by the Kimi Delta Attention blocks). For more information on MLA, and multi-query attention, which is a special case of grouped-query attention, please see my The Big LLM Architecture Comparison article. 2.9 Kimi Delta Attention Kimi Linear modifies the linear attention mechanism of Qwen3-Next by the Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) mechanism, which is essentially a refinement of Gated DeltaNet. Whereas Qwen3-Next applies a scalar gate (one value per attention head) to control the memory decay rate, Kimi Linear replaces it with a channel-wise gating for each feature dimension. According to the authors, this gives more control over the memory, and this, in turn, improves long-context reasoning. In addition, for the full attention layers, Kimi Linear replaces Qwen3-Next\u2019s gated attention layers (which are essentially standard multi-head attention layers with output gating) with multi-head latent attention (MLA). This is the same MLA mechanism used by DeepSeek V3/R1 (as discussed in my The Big LLM Architecture Comparison article) but with an additional gate. (To recap, MLA compresses the key/value space to reduce the KV cache size.) There\u2019s no direct comparison to Qwen3-Next, but compared to the Gated DeltaNet-H1 model from the Gated DeltaNet paper (which is essentially Gated DeltaNet with sliding-window attention), Kimi Linear achieves higher modeling accuracy while maintaining the same token-generation speed. Figure 12: Annotated figure from the Kimi Linear paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26692) showing that Kimi Linear is as fast as GatedDeltaNet, and much faster than an architecture with multi-head latent attention (like DeepSeek V3/R1), while having a higher benchmark performance. Furthermore, according to the ablation studies in the DeepSeek-V2 paper , MLA is on par with regular full attention when the hyperparameters are carefully chosen. And the fact that Kimi Linear compares favorably to MLA on long-context and reasoning benchmarks makes linear attention variant once again promising for larger state-of-the-art models. That being said, Kimi Linear is 48B-parameter large, but it\u2019s 20x smaller than Kimi K2. It will be interesting to see if the Kimi team adopts this approach for their upcoming K3 model. 2.10 The Future of Attention Hybrids Linear attention is not a new concept, but the recent revival of hybrid approaches shows that researchers are again seriously looking for practical ways to make transformers more efficient. For example Kimi Linear, compared to regular full attention, has a 75% KV cache reduction and up to 6x decoding throughput. What makes this new generation of linear attention variants different from earlier attempts is that they are now used together with standard attention rather than replacing it completely. Looking ahead, I expect that the next wave of attention hybrids will focus on further improving long-context stability and reasoning accuracy so that they get closer to the full-attention state-of-the-art. 3. Text Diffusion Models A more radical departure from the standard autoregressive LLM architecture is the family of text diffusion models. You are probably familiar with diffusion models, which are based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models paper from 2020 for generating images (as a successor to generative adversarial networks) that was later implemented, scaled, and popularized by Stable Diffusion and others. Figure 13: Illustration of an image diffusion process from my very first Substack article in 2022. Here, Gaussian noise is added from left to right, and the model\u2019s task is to learn how to remove the noise (from right to left). 3.1 Why Work on Text Diffusion? With the Diffusion\u2011LM Improves Controllable Text Generation paper in 2022, we also started to see the beginning of a trend where researchers started to adopt diffusion models for generating text. And I\u2019ve seen a whole bunch of text diffusion papers in 2025. When I just checked my paper bookmark list, there are 39 text diffusion models on there! Given the rising popularity of these models, I thought it was finally time to talk about them. Figure 14: This section covers text diffusion models. So, what\u2019s the advantage of diffusion models, and why are researchers looking into this as an alternative to traditional, autoregressive LLMs? Traditional transformer-based (autoregressive) LLMs generate one token at a time. For brevity, let\u2019s refer to them simply as autoregressive LLMs . Now, the main selling point of text diffusion-based LLMs (let\u2019s call them \u201cdiffusion LLMs\u201d) is that they can generate multiple tokens in parallel rather than sequentially. Note that diffusion LLMs still require multiple denoising steps. However, even if a diffusion model needs, say, 64 denoising steps to produce all tokens in parallel at each step, this is still computationally more efficient than performing 2,000 sequential generation steps to produce a 2,000-token response. 3.2 The Denoising Process The denoising process in a diffusion LLM, analogous to the denoising process in regular image diffusion models, is shown in the GIF below. (The key difference is that, instead of adding Gaussian noise to pixels, text diffusion corrupts sequences by masking tokens probabilistically.) For this experiment, I ran the 8B instruct model from the Large Language Diffusion Models (LLaDA) paper that came out earlier this year. Figure 15: Illustration of the denoising process using the 8B LLaDA model. As we can see in the animation above, the text diffusion process successively replaces [MASK] tokens with text tokens to generate the answer. If you are familiar with BERT and masked language modeling, you can think of this diffusion process as an iterative application of the BERT forward pass (where BERT is used with different masking rates). Architecture-wise, diffusion LLMs are usually decoder-style transformers but without the causal attention mask. For instance, the aforementioned LLaDA model uses the Llama 3 architecture. We call those architectures without a causal mask \u201cbidirectional\u201d as they have access to all sequence elements all at once. (Note that this is similar to the BERT architecture, which is called \u201cencoder-style\u201d for historical reasons.) So, the main difference between autoregressive LLMs and diffusion LLMs (besides removing the causal mask) is the training objective. Diffusion LLMs like LLaDA use a generative diffusion objective instead of a next-token prediction objective. In image models, the generative diffusion objective is intuitive because we have a continuous pixel space. For instance, adding Gaussian noise and learning to denoise are mathematically natural operations. Text, however, consists of discrete tokens, so we can\u2019t directly add or remove \u201cnoise\u201d in the same continuous sense. So, instead of perturbing pixel intensities, these diffusion LLMs corrupt text by progressively masking tokens at random, where each token is replaced by a special mask token with a specified probability. The model then learns a reverse process that predicts the missing tokens at each step, which effectively \u201cdenoises\u201d (or unmasks) the sequence back to the original text, as shown in the animation in Figure 15 earlier. Explaining the math behind it would be better suited for a separate tutorial, but roughly, we can think about it as BERT extended into a probabilistic maximum-likelihood framework. 3.3 Autoregressive vs Diffusion LLMs Earlier, I said that what makes diffusion LLMs appealing is that they generate (or denoise) tokens in parallel instead of generating them sequentially as in a regular autoregressive LLM. This has the potential for making diffusion models more efficient than autoregressive LLMs. That said, the autoregressive nature of traditional LLMs is one of their key strengths, though. And the problem with pure parallel decoding can be illustrated with an excellent example from the recent ParallelBench: Understanding the Trade-offs of Parallel Decoding in Diffusion LLMs paper. Figure 16: Annotated figure from ParallelBench: Understanding the Trade-offs of Parallel Decoding in Diffusion LLMs paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04767) showing the issue with parallel decoding. For example, consider the following prompt: > \u201cPick a random city for travel: New York, New Orleans, Mexico City, or Panama > City?\u201d Suppose we ask the LLM to generate a two-token answer. It might first sample the token \u201cNew\u201d according to the conditional probability p(y t = \u201dNew\u201d | X). In the next iteration, it would then condition on the previously-generated token and likely choose \u201cYork\u201d or \u201cOrleans,\u201d since both conditional probabilities p(y t+1 = \u201dYork\u201d | X, y t = \u201dNew\u201d) and p(y t+1 = \u201dOrleans\u201d | X, y t = \u201dNew\u201d) are relatively high (because \u201cNew\u201d frequently co-occurs with these continuations in the training set). But if instead both tokens were sampled in parallel, the model might independently select the two highest-probability tokens p(y t = \u201cNew\u201d | X) and p(y {t+1} = \u201cCity\u201d | X) leading to awkward outputs like \u201cNew City.\u201d (This is because the model lacks autoregressive conditioning and fails to capture token dependencies.) In any case, the above is a simplification that makes it sound as if there is no conditional dependency in diffusion LLMs at all. This is not true. A diffusion LLM predicts all tokens in parallel, as said earlier, but the predictions are jointly dependent through the iterative refinement (denoising) steps. Here, each diffusion step conditions on the entire current noisy text. And tokens influence each other through cross-attention and self-attention in every step. So, even though all positions are updated simultaneously, the updates are conditioned on each other through shared attention layers. However, as mentioned earlier, in theory, 20-60 diffusion steps may be cheaper than the 2000 inference steps in an autoregressive LLM when generating a 2000-token answer. 3.4 Text Diffusion Today It\u2019s an interesting trend that vision models adopt components from LLMs like attention and the transformer architecture itself, whereas text-based LLMs are getting inspired by pure vision models, implementing diffusion for text. Personally, besides trying a few demos, I haven\u2019t used many diffusion models yet, but I consider it a trade-off. If we use a low number of diffusion steps, we generate the answer faster but may produce an answer with degraded quality. If we increase the diffusion steps to generate better answers, we may end up with a model that has similar costs to an autoregressive one. To quote the authors of the ParallelBench: Understanding the Trade-offs of Parallel Decoding in Diffusion LLMs paper: [...] we systematically analyse both [diffusion LLMs] and autoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) [diffusion LLMs] under parallel decoding can suffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current parallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism based on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speed-up without compromising quality. Additionally, another particular downside I see is that diffusion LLMs cannot use tools as part of their chain because there is no chain. Maybe it\u2019s possible to interleave them between diffusion steps, but I assume this is not trivial. (Please correct me if I am wrong.) In short, it appears that diffusion LLMs are an interesting direction to explore, but for now, they may not replace autoregressive LLMs. However, I can see them as interesting alternatives to smaller, on-device LLMs, or perhaps replacing smaller, distilled autoregressive LLMs. For instance, Google announced that it is working on a Gemini Diffusion model for text, where they state Rapid response: Generates content significantly faster than even our fastest model so far. And while being faster, it appears that the benchmark performance remains on par with their fast Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite model. It will be interesting to see what the adoption and feedback will be like once the model is released and users try it on different tasks and domains. Figure 17: Benchmark performance of a (faster) diffusion LLM (Gemini Diffusion) versus a fast autoregressive LLM (Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite). Based on the numbers reported in https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-diffusion/#capabilities. 4. World Models So far, we discussed approaches that focused on improving efficiency and making models faster or more scalable. And these approaches usually come at a slightly degraded modeling performance. Now, the topic in this section takes a different angle and focuses on improving modeling performance (not efficiency). This improved performance is achieved by teaching the models an \u201cunderstanding of the world.\u201d World models have traditionally been developed independently of language modeling, but the recent Code World Models paper in September 2025 has made them directly relevant in this context for the first time. Ideally, similar to the other topics of this article, world models are a whole dedicated article (or book) by themselves. However, before we get to the Code World Models (CWM) paper, let me provide at least a short introduction to world models. 4.1 The Main Idea Behind World Models Originally, the idea behind world models is to model outcomes implicitly, i.e., to anticipate what might happen next without those outcomes actually occurring (as illustrated in the figure below). It is similar to how the human brain continuously predicts upcoming events based on prior experience. For example, when we reach for a cup of coffee or tea, our brain already predicts how heavy it will feel, and we adjust our grip before we even touch or lift the cup. Figure 18: Conceptual overview of a world model system. The agent interacts with the environment by observing its current state(t) and taking action(t) to achieve a given objective. In parallel, the agent learns an internal world mode l , which serves as a mental simulation of the environment, which allows it to predict outcomes and plan actions before executing them in the real world. The term \u201cworld model\u201d, as far as I know, was popularized by Ha and Schmidhuber\u2019s 2018 paper of the same name: World Models , which used a VAE plus RNN architecture to learn an internal environment simulator for reinforcement learning agents. (But the term or concept itself essentially just refers to modeling a concept of a world or environment, so it goes back to reinforcement learning and robotics research in the 1980s.) To be honest, I didn\u2019t have the new interpretation of world models on my radar until Yann LeCun\u2019s 2022 article A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence . It was essentially about mapping an alternative path to AI instead of LLMs. 4.2 From Vision to Code That being said, world model papers were all focused on vision domains and spanned a wide range of architectures: from early VAE- and RNN-based models to transformers, diffusion models, and even Mamba-layer hybrids. Now, as someone currently more focused on LLMs, the Code World Model paper (Sep 30, 2025) is the first paper to capture my full attention (no pun intended). This is the first world model (to my knowledge) that maps from text to text (or, more precisely, from code to code). CWM is a 32-billion-parameter open-weight model with a 131k-token context window. Architecturally, it is still a dense decoder-only Transformer with sliding-window attention. Also, like other LLMs, it goes through pre-training, mid-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning stages, but the mid-training data introduces the world-modeling component. 4.3 Code World Models Vs Regular LLMs for Code So, how does this differ from a regular code LLM such as Qwen3-Coder ? Regular models like Qwen3-Coder are trained purely with next-token prediction. They learn patterns of syntax and logic to produce plausible code completions, which gives them a static text-level understanding of programming. CWM, in contrast, learns to simulate what happens when the code runs. It is trained to predict the resulting program state, such as the value of a variable, after performing an action like modifying a line of code, as shown in the figure below. Figure 19: Example of code execution tracing in the Code World Model (CWM). The model predicts how variable states evolve step by step as each line of code executes. Here, the model effectively simulates the code\u2019s behavior . Annotated figure from https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.02387. At inference time, CWM is still an autoregressive transformer that generates one token at a time, just like GPT-style models. The key difference is that these tokens can encode structured execution traces rather than plain text. So, I would maybe not call it a world model, but a world model-augmented LLM. For a first attempt, it performs surprisingly well, and is on par with gpt-oss-20b (mid reasoning effort) at roughly the same size. If test-time-scaling is used, it even performs slightly better than gpt-oss-120b (high reasoning effort) while being 4x smaller. Note that their test-time scaling uses a best@k procedure with generated unit tests (think of a fancy majority voting scheme). It would have been interesting to see a tokens/sec or time-to-solution comparison between CWM and gpt-oss, as they use different test-time-scaling strategies (best@k versus more tokens per reasoning effort). Figure 20: Performance of the code world model (CWM) compared to other popular LLMs on a coding benchmark (SWE-bench). Annotated figure from https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.02387. 5. Small Recursive Transformers You may have noticed that all previous approaches still build on the transformer architecture. The topic of this last section does too, but in contrast to the models we discussed earlier, these are small, specialized transformers designed for reasoning. Yes, reasoning-focused architectures don\u2019t always have to be large. In fact, with the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) a new approach to small recursive transformers has recently gained a lot of attention in the research community. Figure 21: LLM landscape overview; this section small recursive transformers. More specifically, the HRM developers showed that even very small transformer models (with only 4 blocks) can develop impressive reasoning capabilities (on specialized problems) when trained to refine their answers step by step. This resulted in a top spot on the ARC challenge. Figure 22: Example ARC-AGI 1 task (top) from arcprize.org/arc-agi/1 and the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) ranked on the leaderboard (bottom) from arcprize.org/blog/hrm-analysis. The idea behind recursive models like HRM is that instead of producing an answer in one forward pass, the model repeatedly refines its own output in a recursive fashion. (As part of this process, each iteration refines a latent representation, which the authors see as the model\u2019s \u201cthought\u201d or \u201creasoning\u201d process.) The first major example was HRM earlier in the summer, followed by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paper . And most recently, Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks (October 2025) proposes the Tiny Recursive Model (TRM, illustrated in the figure below), which is a simpler and even smaller model (7 million parameters, about 4\u00d7 smaller than HRM) that performs even better on the ARC benchmark. Figure 23: The Tiny Recursive Model (TRM). Annotated figure from https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871. In the remainder of this section, let\u2019s take a look at TRM in a bit more detail. 5.1 What Does Recursion Mean Here? TRM refines its answer through two alternating updates: It computes a latent reasoning state from the current question and answer. It then updates the answer based on that latent state. The training runs for up to 16 refinement steps per batch. Each step performs several no-grad loops to iteratively refine the answer. This is followed by a gradient loop that backpropagates through the full reasoning sequence to update the model weights. It\u2019s important to note that TRM is not a language model operating on text. However, because (a) it\u2019s a transformer-based architecture, (b) reasoning is now a central focus in LLM research, and this model represents a distinctly different take on reasoning, and (c) many readers have asked me to cover HRM (and TRM is its more advanced successor) I decided to include it here. While TRM could be extended to textual question-answer tasks in the future, TRM currently works on grid-based inputs and outputs. In other words, both the \u201cquestion\u201d and the \u201canswer\u201d are grids of discrete tokens (for example, 9\u00d79 Sudoku or 30\u00d730 ARC/Maze puzzles), not text sequences. 5.2 How Does TRM Differ From HRM? HRM consists of two small transformer modules (each 4 blocks) that communicate across recursion levels. TRM only uses a single 2-layer transformer. (Note that the previous TRM figure shows a 4\u00d7 next to the transformer block, but that\u2019s likely to make it easier to compare against HRM.) TRM backpropagates through all recursive steps, whereas HRM only backpropagates through the final few. HRM includes an explicit halting mechanism to determine when to stop iterating. TRM replaces this mechanism with a simple binary cross-entropy loss that learns when to stop iterating. Performance-wise, TRM performs really well compared to HRM, as shown in the figure below. Figure 24: Performance comparison of the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) and Tiny Recursive Model (TRM). The paper included a surprising number of ablation studies, which yielded some interesting additional insights. Here are two that stood out to me: Fewer layers leads to better generalization. Reducing from 4 to 2 layers improved Sudoku accuracy from 79.5% to 87.4%. Attention is not required . Replacing self-attention with a pure MLP layer also improved accuracy (74.7% to 87.4%). But this is only feasible here because the context is small and fixed-length. 5.3 The Bigger Picture While HRM and TRM achieve really good reasoning performance on these benchmarks, comparing them to large LLMs is not quite fair. HRM and TRM are specialized models for tasks like ARC, Sudoku, and Maze pathfinding, whereas LLMs are generalists. Sure, HRM and TRM can be adopted for other tasks as well, but they have to be specially trained on each task. So, in that sense, we can perhaps think of HRM and TRM as efficient pocket calculators, whereas LLM are more like computers, which can do a lot of other things as well. Still, these recursive architectures are exciting proof-of-concepts that highlight how small, efficient models can \u201creason\u201d through iterative self-refinement. Perhaps, in the future, such models could act as reasoning or planning modules embedded within larger tool-using LLM systems. For now, LLMs remain ideal for broad tasks, but domain-specific recursive models like TRM can be developed to solve certain problems more efficiently once the target domain is well understood. Beyond the Sudoku, Maze finding, and ARC proof-of-concept benchmarks, there are possibly lots of use cases in the physics and biology domain where such models could find use. As an interesting tidbit, the author shared that it took less than $500 to train this model, with 4 H100s for around 2 days. I am delighted to see that it\u2019s still possible to do interesting work without a data center. 6. Conclusion I originally planned to cover all models categories in the overview figure, but since the article ended up longer than I expected, I will have to save xLSTMs, Liquid Foundation Models, Transformer-RNN hybrids, and State Space Models for another time (although, Gated DeltaNet already gave a taste of State Space Models and recurrent designs.) As a conclusion to this article, I want to repeat the earlier words, i.e., that standard autoregressive transformer LLMs are proven and have stood the test of time so far. They are also, if efficiency is not the main factor, the best we have for now. Traditional Decoder-Style, Autoregressive Transformers + Proven & mature tooling + \u201cwell-understood\u201d + Scaling laws + SOTA - Expensive training - Expensive inference (except for aforementioned tricks) If I were to start a new LLM-based project today, autoregressive transformer-based LLMs would be my first choice. I definitely find the upcoming attention hybrids very promising, which are especially interesting when working with longer contexts where efficiency is a main concern. Linear Attention Hybrids + Same as decoder-style transformers + Cuts FLOPs/KV memory at long-context tasks - Added complexity - Trades a bit of accuracy for efficiency On the more extreme end, text diffusion models are an interesting development. I\u2019m still somewhat skeptical about how well they perform in everyday use, as I\u2019ve only tried a few quick demos. Hopefully, we\u2019ll soon see a large-scale production deployment with Google\u2019s Gemini Diffusion that we can test on daily and coding tasks, and then find out how people actually feel about them. Text Diffusion Models + Iterative denoising is a fresh idea for text + Better parallelism (no next-token dependence) - Can\u2019t stream answers - Doesn\u2019t benefit from CoT? - Tricky tool-calling? - Solid models but not SOTA While the main selling point of text diffusion models is improved efficiency, code world models sit on the other end of the spectrum, where they aim to improve modeling performance. As of this writing, coding models, based on standard LLMs, are mostly improved through reasoning techniques, yet if you have tried them on trickier challenges, you have probably noticed that they (more or less) still fall short and can\u2019t solve many of the trickier coding problems well. I find code world models particularly interesting and believe they could be an important next step toward developing more capable coding systems. Code World Model + Promising approach to improve code understanding + Verifiable intermediate states - Inclusion of executable code traces complicates training - Code running adds latency Lastly, we covered small recursive transformers such as hierarchical and tiny reasoning models. These are super interesting proof-of-concept models. However, as of today, they are primarily puzzle solvers, not general text or coding models. So, they are not in the same category as the other non-standard LLM alternatives covered in this article. Nonetheless, they are very interesting proofs-of-concept, and I am glad researchers are working on them. Right now, LLMs like GPT-5, DeepSeek R1, Kimi K2, and so forth are developed as special purpose models for free-form text, code, math problems and much more. They feel like brute-force and jack-of-all-trades approach that we use on a variety of tasks, from general knowledge questions to math and code. However, when we perform the same task repeatedly, such brute-force approaches become inefficient and may not even be ideal in terms of specialization. This is where tiny recursive transformers become interesting: they could serve as lightweight, task-specific models that are both efficient and purpose-built for repeated or structured reasoning tasks. Also, I can see them as potential \u201ctools\u201d for other tool-calling LLMs; for instance, when LLMs use Python or calculator APIs to solve math problems, special tiny reasoning models could fill this niche for other types of puzzle- or reasoning-like problems. Small Recursive Transformers + Very small architecture + Good generalization on puzzles - Special purpose models - Limited to puzzles (so far) This has been a long article, but I hope you discovered some of the fascinating approaches that often stay outside the spotlight of mainstream LLMs. And if you\u2019ve been feeling a bit bored by the more or less conventional LLM releases, I hope this helped rekindle your excitement about AI again because there\u2019s a lot of interesting work happening right now!

They are tested, proven, and perform well.</p><p>Moreover, as discussed in the <em>The Big Architecture Comparison</em> article, there are many efficiency improvements, including grouped-query attention, sliding-window attention, multi-head latent attention, and others.</p><p>However, it would be boring (and shortsighted) if researchers and engineers didn&#8217;t work on trying alternatives. So, the remaining sections will cover some of the interesting alternatives that emerged in recent years.</p><h1>2. (Linear) Attention Hybrids</h1><p>Before we discuss the &#8220;more different&#8221; approaches, let&#8217;s first look at transformer-based LLMs that have adopted more efficient attention mechanisms. In particular, the focus is on those that scale linearly rather than quadratically with the number of input tokens.</p><p>There&#8217;s recently been a revival in linear attention mechanisms to improve the efficiency of LLMs.</p><p>The attention mechanism introduced in the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">Attention Is All You Need paper</a> (2017), aka scaled-dot-product attention, remains the most popular attention variant in today&#8217;s LLMs. Besides traditional multi-head attention, it&#8217;s also used in the more efficient flavors like grouped-query attention, sliding window attention, and multi-head latent attention as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lONyteDR4XE\">discussed in my talk</a>.</p><h2><strong>2.1 Traditional Attention and Quadratic Costs</strong></h2><p>The original attention mechanism scales quadratically with the sequence length:</p><div class=\"latex-rendered\"></div><p></p><p>This is because the query (Q), key (K), and value (V) are <em>n</em>-by-<em>d</em> matrices, where <em>d</em> is the embedding dimension (a hyperparameter) and <em>n</em> is the sequence length (i.e., the number of tokens).</p><p>(You can find more details in my <a href=\"https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-and-coding-self-attention\">Understanding and Coding Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention, Causal-Attention, and Cross-Attention in LLMs article</a>)</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Eihw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F911104df-2916-4ab7-a64a-afc4aee26400_1845x2009.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"1585\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Eihw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F911104df-2916-4ab7-a64a-afc4aee26400_1845x2009.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><em>Figure 4: Illustration of the traditional scaled-dot-product attention mechanism in multi-head attention; the quadratic cost in attention due to sequence length n.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2><strong>2.2 Linear attention</strong></h2><p>Linear attention variants have been around for a long time, and I remember seeing tons of papers in the 2020s. For example, one of the earliest I recall is the 2020 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16236\">Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention</a> paper, where the researchers approximated the attention mechanism:</p><div class=\"latex-rendered\"></div><p>Here, &#981;(&#8901;) is a kernel feature function, set to &#981;(x) = elu(x)+1.</p><p>This approximation is efficient because it avoids explicitly computing the n&#215;n attention matrix QK<sup>T</sup>.</p><p>I don&#8217;t want to dwell too long on these older attempts. But the bottom line was that they reduced both time and memory complexity from O(n<sup>2</sup>) to O(n) to make attention much more efficient for long sequences.</p><p>However, they never really gained traction as they degraded the model accuracy, and I have never really seen one of these variants applied in an open-weight state-of-the-art LLM.</p><h2><strong>2.3 Linear Attention Revival</strong></h2><p>In the second half of this year, there has been revival of linear attention variants, as well as a bit of a back-and-forth from some model developers as illustrated in the figure below.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wJGD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7152e0-02e6-4d23-b356-7e9369ded9b2_970x398.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"398\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wJGD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7152e0-02e6-4d23-b356-7e9369ded9b2_970x398.png\" width=\"970\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><em>Figure 5: An overview of the linear attention hybrid architectures.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>The first notable model was <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13585\">MiniMax-M1</a> with lightning attention.</p><p>MiniMax-M1 is a 456B parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 46B active parameters, which came out back in June.</p><p>Then, in August, the Qwen3 team followed up with Qwen3-Next, which I discussed in more detail above. Then, in September, the DeepSeek Team announced <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp\">DeepSeek V3.2</a>. (DeepSeek V3.2 sparse attention mechanism is not strictly linear but at least subquadratic in terms of computational costs, so I think it&#8217;s fair to put it into the same category as MiniMax-M1, Qwen3-Next, and Kimi Linear.)</p><p>All three models (MiniMax-M1, Qwen3-Next, DeepSeek V3.2) replace the traditional quadratic attention variants in most or all of their layers with efficient linear variants.</p><p>Interestingly, there was a recent plot twist, where the MiniMax team released their new 230B parameter M2 model without linear attention, going back to regular attention. The team <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/MiniMax-AI/why-did-m2-end-up-as-a-full-attention-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">stated</a> that linear attention is tricky in production LLMs. It seemed to work fine with regular prompts, but it had poor accuracy in reasoning and multi-turn tasks, which are not only important for regular chat sessions but also agentic applications.</p><p>This could have been a turning point where linear attention may not be worth pursuing after all. However, it gets more interesting.

This allows the model to scale up or down certain features dynamically. The Qwen3-Next developers <a href=\"https://qwen.ai/blog?id=4074cca80393150c248e508aa62983f9cb7d27cd&amp;from=research.latest-advancements-list\">state</a> that this helps with training stability:</p><blockquote><p>[...] the attention output gating mechanism helps eliminate issues like Attention Sink and Massive Activation, ensuring numerical stability across the model.</p></blockquote><p>In short, gated attention modulates the <em>output</em> of standard attention. In the next section, we discuss Gated DeltaNet, which replaces the attention mechanism itself with a recurrent delta-rule memory update.</p><h2><strong>2.6 Gated DeltaNet</strong></h2><p>Now, what is Gated DeltaNet? Gated DeltaNet (short for <em>Gated Delta Network</em>) is Qwen3-Next&#8217;s linear-attention layer, which is intended as an alternative to standard softmax attention. It was adopted from the<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06464\"> Gated Delta Networks: Improving Mamba2 with Delta Rule</a> paper as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Gated DeltaNet was originally proposed as an improved version of Mamba2, where it combines the gated decay mechanism of Mamba2 with a delta rule.</p><p>Mamba is a state-space model (an alternative to transformers), a big topic that deserves separate coverage in the future.</p><p>The delta rule part refers to computing the difference (delta, &#916;) between new and predicted values to update a hidden state that is used as a memory state (more on that later).</p><p>(Side note: Readers with classic machine learning literature can think of this as similar to Hebbian learning inspired by biology: &#8220;Cells that fire together wire together.&#8221; It&#8217;s basically a precursor of the perceptron update rule and gradient descent-based learning, but without supervision.)</p><p>Gated DeltaNet has a gate similar to the gate in gated attention discussed earlier, except that it uses a SiLU instead of logistic sigmoid activation, as illustrated below. (The SiLU choice is likely to improve gradient flow and stability over the standard sigmoid.)</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Bfo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef8dde27-eddd-4e1f-b9f2-1c2ec7901a9e_824x1144.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"892.7087378640776\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Bfo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef8dde27-eddd-4e1f-b9f2-1c2ec7901a9e_824x1144.png\" width=\"643\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Figure 8: Gated attention compared to Gated DeltaNet.</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>However, as shown in the figure above, next to the output gate, the &#8220;gated&#8221;

The advantage is that it scales linearly (via the for-loop) instead of quadratically with context length.</p><p>The downside of this recurrent state update is that, compared to regular (or gated) attention, it sacrifices the global context modeling ability that comes from full pairwise attention.</p><p>Gated DeltaNet, can, to some extend, still capture context, but it has to go through the memory (<em>S</em>) bottleneck. That memory is a fixed size and thus more efficient, but it compresses past context into a single hidden state similar to RNNs.</p><p>That&#8217;s why the Qwen3-Next and Kimi Linear architectures don&#8217;t replace all attention layers with DeltaNet layers but use the 3:1 ratio mentioned earlier.</p><h2><strong>2.7 DeltaNet Memory Savings</strong></h2><p>In the previous section, we discussed the advantage of the DeltaNet over full attention in terms of linear instead of quadratic compute complexity with respect to the context length.</p><p>Next to the linear compute complexity, another big advantage of DeltaNet is the memory savings, as DeltaNet modules don&#8217;t grow the KV cache. (For more information about KV caching, see my <a href=\"https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/coding-the-kv-cache-in-llms\">Understanding and Coding the KV Cache in LLMs from Scratch</a> article). Instead, as mentioned earlier, they keep a fixed-size recurrent state, so memory stays constant with context length.</p><p>For a regular multi-head attention (MHA) layer, we can compute the KV cache size as follows:</p><pre><code>KV_cache_MHA &#8776; batch_size &#215; n_tokens &#215; n_heads &#215; d_head &#215; 2 &#215; bytes</code></pre><p>(The 2 multiplier is there because we have both keys and values that we store in the cache.)</p><p>For the simplified DeltaNet version implemented above, we have:</p><pre><code>KV_cache_DeltaNet = batch_size &#215; n_heads &#215; d_head &#215; d_head &#215; bytes</code></pre><p>Note that the <code>KV_cache_DeltaNet</code> memory size doesn&#8217;t have a context length (<code>n_tokens</code>) dependency. Also, we have only the memory state S that we store instead of separate keys and values, hence <code>2 &#215; bytes</code> becomes just bytes. However, note that we now have a quadratic <code>d_head &#215; d_head</code> in here. This comes from the state:</p><pre><code>S = x.new_zeros(b, self.num_heads, self.head_dim, self.head_dim)</code></pre><p>But that&#8217;s usually nothing to worry about, as the head dimension is usually relatively small. For instance, it&#8217;s 128 in Qwen3-Next.</p><p>The full version with the convolutional mixing is a bit more complex, including the kernel size and so on, but the formulas above should illustrate the main trend and motivation behind the Gated DeltaNet.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ar25!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda0a6fe5-b29d-46ce-ab64-6096a67accd1_2048x1293.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"919\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ar25!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda0a6fe5-b29d-46ce-ab64-6096a67accd1_2048x1293.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Figure 10: A comparison of the growing KV cache size.

Kimi applies NoPE (No Positional Embedding) in multi-head latent attention MLA) layers (global attention). As the authors state, this lets MLA run as pure multi-query attention at inference and avoids RoPE retuning for long&#8209;context scaling (the positional bias is supposedly handled by the Kimi Delta Attention blocks). For more information on MLA, and multi-query attention, which is a special case of grouped-query attention, please see my <a href=\"https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/the-big-llm-architecture-comparison\">The Big LLM Architecture Comparison</a> article.</p><h2><strong>2.9 Kimi Delta Attention</strong></h2><p>Kimi Linear modifies the linear attention mechanism of Qwen3-Next by the Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) mechanism, which is essentially a refinement of Gated DeltaNet.<br />Whereas Qwen3-Next applies a scalar gate (one value per attention head) to control the memory decay rate, Kimi Linear replaces it with a channel-wise gating for each feature dimension. According to the authors, this gives more control over the memory, and this, in turn, improves long-context reasoning.</p><p>In addition, for the full attention layers, Kimi Linear replaces Qwen3-Next&#8217;s gated attention layers (which are essentially standard multi-head attention layers with output gating) with multi-head latent attention (MLA). This is the same MLA mechanism used by DeepSeek V3/R1 (as discussed in my <a href=\"https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/the-big-llm-architecture-comparison\">The Big LLM Architecture Comparison</a> article) but with an additional gate.

For brevity, let&#8217;s refer to them simply as <em>autoregressive LLMs</em>. Now, the main selling point of <em>text diffusion-based LLMs</em> (let&#8217;s call them &#8220;diffusion LLMs&#8221;) is that they can generate multiple tokens in parallel rather than sequentially.</p><p>Note that diffusion LLMs still require multiple denoising steps. However, even if a diffusion model needs, say, 64 denoising steps to produce all tokens in parallel at each step, this is still computationally more efficient than performing 2,000 sequential generation steps to produce a 2,000-token response.</p><h2><strong>3.2 The Denoising Process</strong></h2><p>The denoising process in a diffusion LLM, analogous to the denoising process in regular image diffusion models, is shown in the GIF below. (The key difference is that, instead of adding Gaussian noise to pixels, text diffusion corrupts sequences by masking tokens probabilistically.)</p><p>For this experiment, I ran the 8B instruct model from the<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992\"> Large Language Diffusion Models</a> (LLaDA) paper that came out earlier this year.</p><p></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PyYP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F476348a3-03e7-489d-ab1d-81ad87963f99_800x450.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PyYP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F476348a3-03e7-489d-ab1d-81ad87963f99_800x450.gif\" width=\"800\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Figure 15: Illustration of the denoising process using the 8B LLaDA model.</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p></p><p>As we can see in the animation above, the text diffusion process successively replaces [MASK] tokens with text tokens to generate the answer. If you are familiar with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805\">BERT</a> and masked language modeling, you can think of this diffusion process as an iterative application of the BERT forward pass (where BERT is used with different masking rates).</p><p>Architecture-wise, diffusion LLMs are usually decoder-style transformers but without the causal attention mask. For instance, the aforementioned LLaDA model uses the Llama 3 architecture. We call those architectures without a causal mask &#8220;bidirectional&#8221; as they have access to all sequence elements all at once. (Note that this is similar to the BERT architecture, which is called &#8220;encoder-style&#8221; for historical reasons.)</p><p>So, the main difference between autoregressive LLMs and diffusion LLMs (besides removing the causal mask) is the training objective. Diffusion LLMs like LLaDA use a generative diffusion objective instead of a next-token prediction objective.</p><p>In image models, the generative diffusion objective is intuitive because we have a continuous pixel space. For instance, adding Gaussian noise and learning to denoise are mathematically natural operations. Text, however, consists of discrete tokens, so we can&#8217;t directly add or remove &#8220;noise&#8221; in the same continuous sense.</p><p>So, instead of perturbing pixel intensities, these diffusion LLMs corrupt text by progressively masking tokens at random, where each token is replaced by a special mask token with a specified probability. The model then learns a reverse process that predicts the missing tokens at each step, which effectively &#8220;denoises&#8221; (or unmasks) the sequence back to the original text, as shown in the animation in Figure 15 earlier.</p><p>Explaining the math behind it would be better suited for a separate tutorial, but roughly, we can think about it as BERT extended into a probabilistic maximum-likelihood framework.</p><h2><strong>3.3 Autoregressive vs Diffusion LLMs</strong></h2><p>Earlier, I said that what makes diffusion LLMs appealing is that they generate (or denoise) tokens in parallel instead of generating them sequentially as in a regular autoregressive LLM. This has the potential for making diffusion models more efficient than autoregressive LLMs.</p><p>That said, the autoregressive nature of traditional LLMs is one of their key strengths, though. And the problem with pure parallel decoding can be illustrated with an excellent example from the recent ParallelBench: Understanding the Trade-offs of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04767\">Parallel Decoding in Diffusion LLMs</a> paper.</p><p></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RcdN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab335034-190f-427e-85e8-7044886c3f26_819x572.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"442.0952380952381\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RcdN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab335034-190f-427e-85e8-7044886c3f26_819x572.png\" width=\"633\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Figure 16: Annotated figure from ParallelBench: Understanding the Trade-offs of Parallel Decoding in Diffusion LLMs paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04767) showing the issue with parallel decoding.</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p></p><p>For example, consider the following prompt:</p><p>&gt; &#8220;Pick a random city for travel: New York, New Orleans, Mexico City, or Panama</p><p>&gt; City?&#8221;</p><p>Suppose we ask the LLM to generate a two-token answer. It might first sample the token &#8220;New&#8221; according to the conditional probability p(y<sub>t</sub> = &#8221;New&#8221; | X). </p><p>In the next iteration, it would then condition on the previously-generated token and likely choose &#8220;York&#8221; or &#8220;Orleans,&#8221; since both conditional probabilities </p><p>p(y<sub>t+1</sub> = &#8221;York&#8221; | X, y<sub>t</sub> = &#8221;New&#8221;) and p(y<sub>t+1</sub> = &#8221;Orleans&#8221; | X, y<sub>t</sub> = &#8221;New&#8221;)</p><p>are relatively high (because &#8220;New&#8221; frequently co-occurs with these continuations in the training set). But if instead both tokens were sampled in parallel, the model might independently</p><p>select the two highest-probability tokens p(y<sub>t</sub> = &#8220;New&#8221; | X) and p(y<sub>{t+1}</sub> = &#8220;City&#8221; | X) leading to awkward outputs like &#8220;New City.&#8221; (This is because the model lacks autoregressive conditioning and fails to capture token dependencies.)</p><p>In any case, the above is a simplification that makes it sound as if there is no conditional dependency in diffusion LLMs at all. This is not true. A diffusion LLM predicts all tokens in parallel, as said earlier, but the predictions are jointly dependent through the iterative refinement (denoising) steps.</p><p>Here, each diffusion step conditions on the entire current noisy text. And tokens influence each other through cross-attention and self-attention in every step. So, even though all positions are updated simultaneously, the updates are conditioned on each other through shared attention layers.</p><p>However, as mentioned earlier, in theory, 20-60 diffusion steps may be cheaper than the 2000 inference steps in an autoregressive LLM when generating a 2000-token answer.</p><h2><strong>3.4 Text Diffusion Today</strong></h2><p>It&#8217;s an interesting trend that vision models adopt components from LLMs like attention and the transformer architecture itself, whereas text-based LLMs are getting inspired by pure vision models, implementing diffusion for text.</p><p>Personally, besides trying a few demos, I haven&#8217;t used many diffusion models yet, but I consider it a trade-off. If we use a low number of diffusion steps, we generate the answer faster but may produce an answer with degraded quality. If we increase the diffusion steps to generate better answers, we may end up with a model that has similar costs to an autoregressive one.</p><p>To quote the authors of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04767\">ParallelBench: Understanding the Trade-offs of Parallel Decoding in Diffusion LLMs</a> paper:</p><blockquote><p>[...] we systematically analyse both [diffusion LLMs] and autoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) [diffusion LLMs] under parallel decoding can suffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current parallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism based on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speed-up without compromising quality.</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, another particular downside I see is that diffusion LLMs cannot use tools as part of their chain because there is no chain. Maybe it&#8217;s possible to interleave them between diffusion steps, but I assume this is not trivial. (Please correct me if I am wrong.)</p><p>In short, it appears that diffusion LLMs are an interesting direction to explore, but for now, they may not replace autoregressive LLMs. However, I can see them as interesting alternatives to smaller, on-device LLMs, or perhaps replacing smaller, distilled autoregressive LLMs.</p><p>For instance, Google announced that it is working on a <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-diffusion/\">Gemini Diffusion</a> model for text, where they state</p><blockquote><p>Rapid response: Generates content significantly faster than even our fastest model so far.</p></blockquote><p>And while being faster, it appears that the benchmark performance remains on par with their fast Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite model. It will be interesting to see what the adoption and feedback will be like once the model is released and users try it on different tasks and domains.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QFcN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99dd56ef-ed85-4197-8959-bec6059de9c7_2048x1295.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"921\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QFcN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99dd56ef-ed85-4197-8959-bec6059de9c7_2048x1295.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Figure 17: Benchmark performance of a (faster) diffusion LLM (Gemini Diffusion) versus a fast autoregressive LLM (Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite).

World Models</h1><p>So far, we discussed approaches that focused on improving efficiency and making models faster or more scalable. And these approaches usually come at a slightly degraded modeling performance.</p><p>Now, the topic in this section takes a different angle and focuses on improving modeling performance (not efficiency). This improved performance is achieved by teaching the models an &#8220;understanding of the world.&#8221;</p><p>World models have traditionally been developed independently of language modeling, but the recent <a href=\"https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.02387\">Code World Models</a> paper in September 2025 has made them directly relevant in this context for the first time.</p><p>Ideally, similar to the other topics of this article, world models are a whole dedicated article (or book) by themselves. However, before we get to the Code World Models (CWM) paper, let me provide at least a short introduction to world models.</p><h2><strong>4.1 The Main Idea Behind World Models</strong></h2><p>Originally, the idea behind world models is to model outcomes implicitly, i.e., to anticipate what might happen next without those outcomes actually occurring (as illustrated in the figure below). It is similar to how the human brain continuously predicts upcoming events based on prior experience. For example, when we reach for a cup of coffee or tea, our brain already predicts how heavy it will feel, and we adjust our grip before we even touch or lift the cup.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!d-nj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c9567c7-aab2-4b1a-96c9-1c12b33bd340_2048x1213.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"269.375\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!d-nj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c9567c7-aab2-4b1a-96c9-1c12b33bd340_2048x1213.png\" width=\"455\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><em><strong>Figure 18:</strong> Conceptual overview of a world model system.

(But the term or concept itself essentially just refers to modeling a concept of a world or environment, so it goes back to reinforcement learning and robotics research in the 1980s.)</p><p>To be honest, I didn&#8217;t have the new interpretation of world models on my radar until Yann LeCun&#8217;s 2022 article <a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf\">A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence</a>. It was essentially about mapping an alternative path to AI instead of LLMs.</p><h2><strong>4.2 From Vision to Code</strong></h2><p>That being said, world model papers were all focused on vision domains and spanned a wide range of architectures: from early VAE- and RNN-based models to transformers, diffusion models, and even Mamba-layer hybrids.</p><p>Now, as someone currently more focused on LLMs, the <a href=\"https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.02387\">Code World Model</a> paper (Sep 30, 2025) is the first paper to capture my full attention (no pun intended). This is the first world model (to my knowledge) that maps from text to text (or, more precisely, from code to code).</p><p>CWM is a 32-billion-parameter open-weight model with a 131k-token context window. Architecturally, it is still a dense decoder-only Transformer with sliding-window attention.

Annotated figure from https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871.</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>In the remainder of this section, let&#8217;s take a look at TRM in a bit more detail.</p><h2><strong>5.1 What Does Recursion Mean Here?</strong></h2><p>TRM refines its answer through two alternating updates:</p><ol><li><p>It computes a latent reasoning state from the current question and answer.</p></li><li><p>It then updates the answer based on that latent state.</p></li></ol><p>The training runs for up to 16 refinement steps per batch. Each step performs several no-grad loops to iteratively refine the answer. This is followed by a gradient loop that backpropagates through the full reasoning sequence to update the model weights.</p><p>It&#8217;s important to note that TRM is not a language model operating on text. However, because (a) it&#8217;s a transformer-based architecture, (b) reasoning is now a central focus in LLM research, and this model represents a distinctly different take on reasoning, and (c) many readers have asked me to cover HRM (and TRM is its more advanced successor) I decided to include it here.</p><p>While TRM could be extended to textual question-answer tasks in the future, TRM currently works on grid-based inputs and outputs. In other words, both the &#8220;question&#8221; and the &#8220;answer&#8221; are grids of discrete tokens (for example, 9&#215;9 Sudoku or 30&#215;30 ARC/Maze puzzles), not text sequences.</p><h2><strong>5.2 How Does TRM Differ From HRM?</strong></h2><p>HRM consists of two small transformer modules (each 4 blocks) that communicate across recursion levels. TRM only uses a single 2-layer transformer. (Note that the previous TRM figure shows a 4&#215; next to the transformer block, but that&#8217;s likely to make it easier to compare against HRM.)</p><p>TRM backpropagates through all recursive steps, whereas HRM only backpropagates through the final few.</p><p>HRM includes an explicit halting mechanism to determine when to stop iterating. TRM replaces this mechanism with a simple binary cross-entropy loss that learns when to stop iterating.</p><p>Performance-wise, TRM performs really well compared to HRM, as shown in the figure below.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9a2Q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e6db3b8-d36f-4e5c-8204-c56b315cc7b8_1600x2048.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"1864\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9a2Q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e6db3b8-d36f-4e5c-8204-c56b315cc7b8_1600x2048.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Figure 24: Performance comparison of the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) and Tiny Recursive Model (TRM).</em></p><p>The paper included a surprising number of ablation studies, which yielded some interesting additional insights. Here are two that stood out to me:</p><ol><li><p>Fewer layers leads to better generalization.<strong> </strong>Reducing from 4 to 2 layers improved Sudoku accuracy from 79.5% to 87.4%.</p></li><li><p>Attention is not required<strong>. </strong>Replacing self-attention with a pure MLP layer also improved accuracy (74.7% to 87.4%). But this is only feasible here because the context is small and fixed-length.</p></li></ol><h2><strong>5.3 The Bigger Picture</strong></h2><p>While HRM and TRM achieve really good reasoning performance on these benchmarks, comparing them to large LLMs is not quite fair. HRM and TRM are specialized models for tasks like ARC, Sudoku, and Maze pathfinding, whereas LLMs are generalists. Sure, HRM and TRM can be adopted for other tasks as well, but they have to be specially trained on each task. So, in that sense, we can perhaps think of HRM and TRM as efficient pocket calculators, whereas LLM are more like computers, which can do a lot of other things as well.</p><p>Still, these recursive architectures are exciting proof-of-concepts that highlight how small, efficient models can &#8220;reason&#8221; through iterative self-refinement. Perhaps, in the future, such models could act as reasoning or planning modules embedded within larger tool-using LLM systems.</p><p>For now, LLMs remain ideal for broad tasks, but domain-specific recursive models like TRM can be developed to solve certain problems more efficiently once the target domain is well understood. Beyond the Sudoku, Maze finding, and ARC proof-of-concept benchmarks, there are possibly lots of use cases in the physics and biology domain where such models could find use.</p><p>As an interesting tidbit, the author shared that it took less than $500 to train this model, with 4 H100s for around 2 days. I am delighted to see that it&#8217;s still possible to do interesting work without a data center.</p><p></p><h1>6. Conclusion</h1><p>I originally planned to cover all models categories in the overview figure, but since the article ended up longer than I expected, I will have to save xLSTMs, Liquid Foundation Models, Transformer-RNN hybrids, and State Space Models for another time (although, Gated DeltaNet already gave a taste of State Space Models and recurrent designs.)</p><p>As a conclusion to this article, I want to repeat the earlier words, i.e., that standard autoregressive transformer LLMs are proven and have stood the test of time so far. They are also, if efficiency is not the main factor, the best we have for now.</p><p><strong>Traditional Decoder-Style, Autoregressive Transformers</strong></p><p>+ Proven &amp; mature tooling<br />+ &#8220;well-understood&#8221;<br />+ Scaling laws<br />+ SOTA<br />- Expensive training<br />- Expensive inference (except for aforementioned tricks)</p><p>If I were to start a new LLM-based project today, autoregressive transformer-based LLMs would be my first choice.</p><p>I definitely find the upcoming attention hybrids very promising, which are especially interesting when working with longer contexts where efficiency is a main concern.</p><p><strong>Linear Attention Hybrids</strong></p><p>+ Same as decoder-style transformers<br />+ Cuts FLOPs/KV memory at long-context tasks<br />- Added complexity<br />- Trades a bit of accuracy for efficiency</p><p>On the more extreme end, text diffusion models are an interesting development. I&#8217;m still somewhat skeptical about how well they perform in everyday use, as I&#8217;ve only tried a few quick demos. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll soon see a large-scale production deployment with Google&#8217;s Gemini Diffusion that we can test on daily and coding tasks, and then find out how people actually feel about them.</p><p><strong>Text Diffusion Models</strong></p><p>+ Iterative denoising is a fresh idea for text<br />+ Better parallelism (no next-token dependence)<br />- Can&#8217;t stream answers<br />- Doesn&#8217;t benefit from CoT?<br />- Tricky tool-calling?<br />- Solid models but not SOTA</p><p>While the main selling point of text diffusion models is improved efficiency, code world models sit on the other end of the spectrum, where they aim to improve modeling performance. As of this writing, coding models, based on standard LLMs, are mostly improved through reasoning techniques, yet if you have tried them on trickier challenges, you have probably noticed that they (more or less) still fall short and can&#8217;t solve many of the trickier coding problems well.</p><p>I find code world models particularly interesting and believe they could be an important next step toward developing more capable coding systems.</p><p><strong>Code World Model</strong></p><p>+ Promising approach to improve code understanding<br />+ Verifiable intermediate states<br />- Inclusion of executable code traces complicates training<br />- Code running adds latency</p><p>Lastly, we covered small recursive transformers such as hierarchical and tiny reasoning models. These are super interesting proof-of-concept models. However, as of today, they are primarily puzzle solvers, not general text or coding models. So, they are not in the same category as the other non-standard LLM alternatives covered in this article. Nonetheless, they are very interesting proofs-of-concept, and I am glad researchers are working on them.</p><p>Right now, LLMs like GPT-5, DeepSeek R1, Kimi K2, and so forth are developed as special purpose models for free-form text, code, math problems and much more. They feel like brute-force and jack-of-all-trades approach that we use on a variety of tasks, from general knowledge questions to math and code.</p><p>However, when we perform the same task repeatedly, such brute-force approaches become inefficient and may not even be ideal in terms of specialization. This is where tiny recursive transformers become interesting: they could serve as lightweight, task-specific models that are both efficient and purpose-built for repeated or structured reasoning tasks.</p><p>Also, I can see them as potential &#8220;tools&#8221; for other tool-calling LLMs; for instance, when LLMs use Python or calculator APIs to solve math problems, special tiny reasoning models could fill this niche for other types of puzzle- or reasoning-like problems.</p><p><strong>Small Recursive Transformers</strong></p><p>+ Very small architecture<br />+ Good generalization on puzzles<br />- Special purpose models<br />- Limited to puzzles (so far)</p><p>This has been a long article, but I hope you discovered some of the fascinating approaches that often stay outside the spotlight of mainstream LLMs.</p><p>And if you&#8217;ve been feeling a bit bored by the more or less conventional LLM releases, I hope this helped rekindle your excitement about AI again because there&#8217;s a lot of interesting work happening right now!</p><div><hr /></div><p><em>This magazine is a personal passion project, and your support helps keep it alive.</em></p><p><em>If you&#8217;d like to support my work, please consider my <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4fqvn0D\">Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)</a> book or its follow-up, <a href=\"https://mng.bz/Nwr7\">Build a Reasoning Model (From Scratch)</a>.
