You know that GAMLSS regression post we wrote? \ud83e\udde0 : Do you mean the monstrosity that took an entire month out of our lives, spawned an unhinged prequel post about the Box-Cox power exponential distribution and then another unhinged prequel post about B-splines and P-splines ? The one that brought us to tears several times and made us question our entire reason for being? The one that literally gave you nightmares? The accursed one, the post we swore we were finished with and would never ever revisit upon pain of death. Is that the post you mean? \ud83e\udec0 : Uh, yeah. \ud83e\udde0 : Oh yes, I remember it. What about it? \ud83e\udec0 : I, um\u2026 look\u2026 I think it, uhhhhh\u2026 needs a sequel post. We should talk about survey weights. I mean, I know it\u2019s not our job to talk about all the things, but it does sort of matter right? And we\u2019ve come so far with this thing, we should finish the job properly, right? I mean, I know we\u2019re not getting paid for this, but you do like to do a good job with things right? Just one more post? Please???? \ud83e\udde0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udde0 : Girl. Seriously though. What the actual fuck is wrong with you? The worst thing about being a scientist 1 is the fact that no matter how hard you work and no matter how diligent you are in learning skills that fall outside your core discipline, you will on a regular basis get slammed by outside context problems . You are trained to work within a particular framework, and you are exquisitely skilled at handling situations that fall within the scope of that framework. You are, almost by definition, a specialist . The days of the \u201crenaissance polymath\u201d are well and truly behind us, simply because science has advanced so far that no human mind can encompass the whole bloody thing at this point. It\u2019s impossible. This is of course a great triumph for science, but a terrible tragedy for the scientist who will always find themselves getting fucked over badly the moment \u201cthe thing I was trained for\u201d turns out to require knowledge from \u201cone of the million other things I was not trained for\u201d. The cruel reality of science is that we feel like fucking morons every single day because there are so very many traps, tripwires, and landmines strewn across the golden fields of science. We all fuck up. All the time. It\u2019s a core part of the job, actually. The trick, if you\u2019re a newly minted scientist hoping to survive in the badlands of real research, is to remain humble in the face complexity. When \u2013 not if \u2013 it happens to you, and you make a mistake, the thing you have to do own it and admit you were wrong. 2 Nobody with a shred of integrity will think less of you for admitting a mistake. And so it is in this spirit that I have to admit there\u2019s a mistake in my GAMLSS post . As of this exact moment of writing I don\u2019t know for certain how bad the mistake is because I haven\u2019t checked yet. 3 I have some reason to think my mistake isn\u2019t terrible , but I don\u2019t know for sure, and I\u2019m about to find out as soon as I write the rest of this post. Not gonna lie, I\u2019m a bit nervous. Survey weights The mistake I made in that post is one that experimentalists such as myself 4 are particularly prone to. I took data from a structured, stratified survey \u2013 in this case the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) \u2013 and analysed it as if it were a simple random sample, which it most certainly is not. In short, I forgot to consider survey weights. The mistake is embarrassing to me because the NHANES website has an entire study design tutorial that talks specifically about this issue 5 and like an idiot 6 I didn\u2019t take it into account. Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh. To understand the nature of my mistake, all you need to do is read the first paragraph of the NHANES tutorial discussing the design of the study: The NHANES samples are not simple random samples. Rather, a complex, multistage, probability sampling design is used to select participants representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population. Oversampling of certain population subgroups is also done to increase the reliability and precision of health status indicator estimates for these particular subgroups. Researchers need to take this into account in their analyses by appropriately specifying the sampling design parameters. Oh. Right. Yeah. Guess which bitch forgot to do that? Guess which bitch is now all of a sudden remembering that lots of surveys use stratified sampling, lot of surveys use oversampling for populations of interest, and lots of surveys discuss survey weights quite prominently on their websites 7 in the hope that researchers don\u2019t make the exact mistake that she did, in fact, make? That\u2019s right, this bitch. Oops. What do survey weights do? So let\u2019s start by thinking about what survey weights are supposed to do. Reduced to the simplest description I can think of, the idea is to introduce a correction factor that adjusts for whatever sampling biases are known to exist in the sample. Suppose, for example, an Australian survey were designed with an intentional 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. There might be reasons for doing this: the population of New South Wales is about 8,500,000 people, whereas Tasmania has only about 580,000 people or thereabouts. If we sampled Australians purely at random, our survey might not have enough Tasmanians in it to be able to say much about Tasmanian residents. Given the differences in population size, you\u2019d expect to see about 15 residents from New South Wales in the sample for every Tasmanian. That could be a problem if we have a need to understand state-by-state differences as well as understand the overall Australian population. Yes, we\u2019d be able to learn about Australia overall, but at the state level we\u2019d learn a lot more about New South Wales and Victoria than we would about Tasmania and South Australia. That\u2019s not ideal. Given this concern, then, we decide to adopt a 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. This means that any individual Tasmanian resident is 5x as likely to be included in the survey than any individual resident of New South Wales. We\u2019ll still end up with more people from New South Wales (because the actual population difference is 15x not 5x), but the final sample will now only have about 3x as many folks from New South Wales as from Tasmania. It\u2019s different, certainly, but we\u2019ll now be able to learn the things that we need to learn at the state-by-state level. The drawback to oversampling Tasmanians, however, is that the sample is now unrepresentative of the nation as a whole. If you want to construct estimates of some quantity for the whole nation, we have to give each NSW resident in the sample 5x the weight that we give to each Tasmanian, in order to correct for the Tasmanian oversampling. This correction factor is the survey weight , and it needs to be taken into account when analysing data from our survey. To be a little more precise about it, here\u2019s the description that the Australian Bureau of Statistics uses to describe survey weights as they apply to the Survey of Income and Housing: Weighting is the process of adjusting results from a sample survey to infer results for the total in scope population whether that be persons or households. To do this, a weight is allocated to each sample unit (e.g.\u00a0a person or a household). The weight is a value which indicates how many population units are represented by the sample unit. The first step in calculating weights for each unit is to assign an initial weight, which is the inverse of the probability of being selected in the survey. For example, if the probability of a household being selected in the survey was 1 in 600, then the household would have an initial weight of 600 (that is, it represents 600 households). Crudely put, the survey weight is a measure of \u201chow many individuals in the population does this sampled row represent?\u201d. In my hypothetical survey with Tasmanian oversampling, each surveyed person from NSW represents 5x as many Australians as each surveyed Tasmanian, and hence those data should weighted 5x as highly when making calculations about Australia as a whole. So now we return to my GAMLSS post and it\u2019s clearer why the models I developed weren\u2019t ideal: the NHANES data set contains survey weights (in a few different forms, actually) and I forgot to take them into account when fitting my models for population height and weight. In hindsight, it\u2019s obvious really. How bad was my mistake? So let\u2019s revisit my GAMLSS modelling for the NHANES data set. The nhanes data frame shown below is very similar to the one I used last time, with two substantial differences: I\u2019ve restricted it to the 10 year period 2009-2018 and added a survey_wt column that constructs the appropriate 10-year survey weight for these data: 8 Code for NHANES data import and preprocessing # directories post_dir <- rprojroot :: find_root_file ( criterion = rprojroot :: has_file ( \".here\" ) ) local_dir <- fs :: path (post_dir, \"nhanes\" ) data_dir <- fs :: path (local_dir, \"data\" ) output_dir <- fs :: path (local_dir, \"output\" ) # conversion based on NHANES average length_to_height <- function (length_cm) { length_cm - 1.06 } # all demographics and body measurement files for the 5 two-year cycles # spanning the decade from 2009 to 2018 demo_files <- fs :: dir_ls (fs :: path (data_dir, \"demo\" ), regexp = \"[FGHIJ] \\\\ .xpt\" ) bmx_files <- fs :: dir_ls (fs :: path (data_dir, \"bmx\" ), regexp = \"[FGHIJ] \\\\ .xpt\" ) # read demographics file (selected variables only) demos <- demo_files |> purrr :: map (\\(xx) { dd <- haven :: read_xpt (xx) if ( !

Noting this, let\u2019s fit a model for height by age, similar to what I did in my GAMLSS post. This time around I\u2019ll do it in two wats, one version using the weights and another version ignoring the weights. Here\u2019s what we get: Code for GAMLSS model fitting height_unweighted_file <- fs :: path (post_dir, \"nhanes\" , \"output\" , \"height_unweighted.rds\" ) height_weighted_file <- fs :: path (post_dir, \"nhanes\" , \"output\" , \"height_weighted.rds\" ) pb <- gamlss :: pb rerun <- FALSE if (rerun) { # unweighted model for height by age height_unweighted <- gamlss :: gamlss ( formula       = height_cm ~ pb (age_mn), sigma.formula = ~ pb (age_mn), nu.formula    = ~ 1 , tau.formula   = ~ 1 , data    = nhanes, family  = gamlss.dist :: BCPE ) # unweighted model for height by age height_weighted <- gamlss :: gamlss ( formula       = height_cm ~ pb (age_mn), sigma.formula = ~ pb (age_mn), nu.formula    = ~ 1 , tau.formula   = ~ 1 , data    = nhanes, weights = survey_wt, family  = gamlss.dist :: BCPE ) saveRDS (height_unweighted, file = height_unweighted_file) saveRDS (height_weighted, file = height_weighted_file) } else { height_unweighted <- readRDS ( file = height_unweighted_file) height_weighted <- readRDS ( file = height_weighted_file) } height_mod <- list ( unweighted = height_unweighted, weighted = height_weighted ) quartose :: quarto_tabset (height_mod, level = 3 ) unweighted weighted Family:  c(\"BCPE\", \"Box-Cox Power Exponential\")  \nFitting method: RS()  \n \nCall:   \ngamlss::gamlss(formula = height_cm ~ pb(age_mn), sigma.formula = ~pb(age_mn),   \n    nu.formula = ~1, tau.formula = ~1, family = gamlss.dist::BCPE,   \n    data = nhanes)  \n \nMu Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   pb(age_mn)   \n  111.12971      0.09179   \nSigma Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   pb(age_mn)   \n -3.0519544    0.0003807   \nNu Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   \n     0.3507   \nTau Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   \n     0.8091   \n \n Degrees of Freedom for the fit: 32.97 Residual Deg. of Freedom   45320  \nGlobal Deviance:     316144  \n            AIC:     316210  \n            SBC:     316498 Family:  c(\"BCPE\", \"Box-Cox Power Exponential\")  \nFitting method: RS()  \n \nCall:   \ngamlss::gamlss(formula = height_cm ~ pb(age_mn), sigma.formula = ~pb(age_mn),   \n    nu.formula = ~1, tau.formula = ~1, family = gamlss.dist::BCPE,   \n    data = nhanes, weights = survey_wt)  \n \nMu Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   pb(age_mn)   \n   126.1940       0.0694   \nSigma Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   pb(age_mn)   \n -3.0145454    0.0002932   \nNu Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   \n     0.4874   \nTau Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   \n     0.8769   \n \n Degrees of Freedom for the fit: 33.82 Residual Deg. of Freedom   45319  \nGlobal Deviance:     2137800000  \n            AIC:     2137800000  \n            SBC:     2137800000 Now let\u2019s draw the quantile curves that come out of both versions of the model fitting exercise. Thankfully for us, they look very, very similar: Code to compute and plot quantiles get_pars <- function (data, model) { pars <- tibble :: tibble ( mu    = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"mu\" ), sigma = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"sigma\" ), nu    = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"nu\" ), tau   = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"tau\" ), ) dplyr :: bind_cols (data, pars) } age_max_yr <- 40 predict_cases <- tidyr :: expand_grid ( age_mn  = 1 : (age_max_yr * 12 ), weighted = c ( TRUE , FALSE ) ) predict_pars <- dplyr :: bind_rows ( predict_cases |> dplyr :: filter (weighted == TRUE ) |> dplyr :: select ( - weighted) |> get_pars (height_mod $ weighted) |> dplyr :: mutate ( model_type = \"weighted\" ), predict_cases |> dplyr :: filter (weighted == FALSE ) |> dplyr :: select ( - weighted) |> get_pars (height_mod $ unweighted) |> dplyr :: mutate ( model_type = \"unweighted\" ) ) predict_quantiles <- predict_pars |> dplyr :: mutate ( q05 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 05 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q25 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 25 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q50 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 50 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q75 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 75 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q95 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 95 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), age_yr = age_mn / 12 ) predict_quantiles_long <- predict_quantiles |> tidyr :: pivot_longer ( cols = dplyr :: starts_with ( \"q\" ), names_to = \"quantile\" , values_to = \"height_cm\" ) predict_quantiles_compare <- predict_quantiles_long |> dplyr :: select (age_mn, age_yr, height_cm, quantile, model_type) |> tidyr :: pivot_wider ( names_from = model_type, values_from = height_cm ) ggplot2 :: ggplot () + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( data = nhanes |> dplyr :: filter (age_yr < age_max_yr), mapping = ggplot2 :: aes (age_mn, height_cm), size = . 25 ) + ggplot2 :: geom_path ( data = predict_quantiles_long, mapping = ggplot2 :: aes (age_mn, height_cm, color = quantile) ) + ggplot2 :: facet_wrap ( ~ model_type) + ggplot2 :: theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) To illustrate the point slightly more precisely, the graphs below plot the quantiles estimated from the weighted model directly against those estimated by from the unweighted model. When drawn like this, the two models are indistinguishable: Code for the replotting predict_quantiles_compare |> ggplot2 :: ggplot ( mapping = ggplot2 :: aes ( x = unweighted, y = weighted, color = quantile ) ) + ggplot2 :: geom_abline ( intercept = 0 , slope = 1 ) + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( size = 3 , alpha = . 1 , show.legend = FALSE ) + ggplot2 :: facet_wrap ( ~ quantile) Well thank fuck. Now, this is not to say that the models are literally identical. There are systematic differences between the unweighted and weighted models, which show up the moment if we plot the differences between the two versions of the model on the y-axis, but the key thing here is to pay attention to the scale of the y-axis. Even for adults, where you might worry that systematic oversampling in NHANES might start to make a difference, the differences between the two models are never larger than a 2cm discrepancy: Code for the residuals plot predict_quantiles_compare |> ggplot2 :: ggplot ( mapping = ggplot2 :: aes ( x = age_yr, y = unweighted - weighted, color = quantile ) ) + ggplot2 :: geom_hline ( yintercept = 0 ) + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( size = 1 ) This makes clear that I did make a mistake \u2013 that part is still true \u2013 but thankfully the discrepancies between what the correctly weighted model predicts and what my original unweighted model predicts are pretty small. In the context of the analyses that I described in the original GAMLSS post and \u2013 much more importantly \u2013 the real world analyses in which I\u2019ve used an unweighted model when I should have used a weighted model, the scale of the discrepancy is so small that it won\u2019t affect any of the \u201cdownstream\u201d analyses. I\u2019m not going to have to send an emergency mea culpa to anyone. The conclusions of my analyses won\u2019t change. Again, thank fuck. Survey weights matter \ud83e\udde0 : So we\u2019re done now, right? You\u2019ve made your mea culpa, you\u2019ve outlined the reasons why the specific worry doesn\u2019t alter the inferences that would be made in the contexts we\u2019ve had to do this kind of work. Very diligent of us. Much proud. Very detail. Et cetera. We can stop now, yes? We\u2019ve done our duty admirably, thanks to your whining and panic. It can end now, yes? No more words need to be written? \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : Okay, about that\u2026 The truth is that I\u2019ve gotten lucky in my analyses, and so have all the other people who have used NHANES data the same way I have. 9 I forgot to take account of something that can matter, and I was fortunate enough that in my specific use cases it didn\u2019t matter. But the nature of luck is that you aren\u2019t always lucky. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. It is not too difficult to come up with examples where the survey weights really do matter, and the rest of the post will be devoted to a one such case. My example is a little artificial, but it will suffice. For the purposes of this example I\u2019m going to focus on the data from the 2015-2018 period, corresponding to the 2-year release cycles labelled \u201cI\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d in the data files. As described in the sample design report for this period, the oversampled subgroups during this period were: Hispanic persons; Non-Hispanic black persons; Non-Hispanic, non-black Asian persons; Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities at or below 185% of the federal poverty level; and Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities aged 0\u201311 years or 80 years and over. The language is oddly stilted, presumably because the authors of the report are being admirably cautious and have defined the groups using a set of non-overlapping categories. But if we were to be a little more informal, we\u2019d notice that these are the oversampled demographics: Hispanic people Black people Asian people Low-income people Young people Old people This makes sense for NHANES. I\u2019m not privvy to their decision making process but I think I can guess the logic: Hispanic, Black, and Asian demographics are oversampled for the same reason that Tasmanians are oversampled in my hypothetical survey at the beginning. They are minority demographics for which we might need to boost the sample size to allow group-by-group comparisons to work. In contrast, I suspect lower-income people, younger people, and older people are all oversampled because NHANES is primarily a survey about health and nutrition, and these three groups are at higher risk of concerns than the rest of the population. Noting all this, let\u2019s construct an example that deliberately exploits the structure of this oversampling in order to show why sample weights matter. One of the questions in the NHANES demographic survey asks about country of birth. The question is (on purpose, I suspect) quite coarse-grained. It just asks if you were born in the United States or not, that\u2019s it. Here\u2019s a version of the NHANES data that includes a column for us_born : Code for NHANES data import and preprocessing # demographics files of relevance demo_files <- fs :: dir_ls (fs :: path (data_dir, \"demo\" ), regexp = \"[IJ] \\\\ .xpt\" ) # read and process demographics file (selected variables only) nhanes_2 <- demo_files |> purrr :: map (\\(xx) { dd <- haven :: read_xpt (xx) dd <- dplyr :: select (dd, SEQN, RIAGENDR, RIDAGEYR, RIDEXAGM, DMDBORN4, WTINT2YR) dd }) |> dplyr :: bind_rows ( .id = \"file_demo\" ) |> dplyr :: mutate ( file_demo = fs :: path_file (file_demo)) |> dplyr :: select ( id          = SEQN, sex_s       = RIAGENDR, # sex/gender at screen (1 = M, 2 = F, . = NA) age_yr      = RIDAGEYR, # natal age at screening (years) survey_wt   = WTINT2YR, # 2-year weight for persons with interview data birth_cnt   = DMDBORN4, # country of birth (1 = US, 2 = other, all other codes NA) file_demo ) |> dplyr :: mutate ( sex_num = sex_s - 1 , # rescale to 0 = M, 1 = F sex_fct = factor (sex_s, levels = 1 : 2 , labels = c ( \"male\" , \"female\" )), us_born = dplyr :: case_when ( birth_cnt == 1 ~ TRUE , birth_cnt == 2 ~ FALSE , TRUE ~ NA ), survey_wt = survey_wt / 2 , # convert from 2-year to 4-year weight cohort = dplyr :: case_when ( file_demo == \"DEMO_I.xpt\" ~ \"2015-2016\" , file_demo == \"DEMO_J.xpt\" ~ \"2017-2018\" , TRUE ~ NA ) ) |> dplyr :: select ( id, sex_fct, age_yr, us_born, survey_wt ) |> dplyr :: filter (age_yr < 80 ) nhanes_2 # A tibble: 18,422 \u00d7 5\n      id sex_fct age_yr us_born survey_wt\n   <dbl> <fct>    <dbl> <lgl>       <dbl>\n 1 83732 male        62 TRUE       67336.\n 2 83733 male        53 FALSE      12164.\n 3 83734 male        78 TRUE        6200.\n 4 83735 female      56 TRUE       51359.\n 5 83736 female      42 TRUE        8814.\n 6 83737 female      72 FALSE       5626.\n 7 83738 female      11 TRUE        4982.\n 8 83739 male         4 TRUE       22375.\n 9 83740 male         1 TRUE        4946.\n10 83741 male        22 TRUE       18522.\n# \u2139 18,412 more rows Now, what I really ought to do here if I were being careful would be to also import variables corresponding to covariates of interest. I could, for example, include those variables that record race and ethnicity information for the NHANES participants. In this case that is especially important, because we know that oversampling is related to race and ethnicity, and we also know on the basis of commonsense that country of bith will also be related to race and ethnicity. 10 A well-constructed analysis of us_born as an outcome variable should include these as explicit covariates. However. I\u2019m not going to do that. I will, on purpose and with malice aforethought, omit critical variables of interest to the substantive problem. My version of the data set includes only two variables that we might use as predictors: age_yr and sex_fct . That\u2019s all you get. That, and the survey_wt variable that will turn out to be critically important because I dropped the other covariates! Noting that I\u2019ve done something malicious in the construction of the data set, let\u2019s move forward and look at what happens when we estimate the proportion of US residents who are also US born, stratified by age and sex. There are two versions of this calculation shown, one that uses the survey weights, and another that ignores them: birth_country <- nhanes_2 |> dplyr :: filter ( ! is.na (us_born)) |> dplyr :: summarise ( us_born_unweighted = mean (us_born), us_born_weighted = sum (us_born * survey_wt) / sum (survey_wt), .by = c (age_yr, sex_fct) ) |> dplyr :: arrange (age_yr) birth_country # A tibble: 160 \u00d7 4\n   age_yr sex_fct us_born_unweighted us_born_weighted\n    <dbl> <fct>                <dbl>            <dbl>\n 1      0 female               0.992            0.994\n 2      0 male                 1                1    \n 3      1 male                 0.982            0.979\n 4      1 female               0.984            0.987\n 5      2 female               0.978            0.982\n 6      2 male                 0.977            0.984\n 7      3 male                 0.951            0.956\n 8      3 female               0.977            0.984\n 9      4 male                 0.969            0.982\n10      4 female               0.976            0.982\n# \u2139 150 more rows Looking at the few rows of this table that you can see in this summary, it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much difference between the weighted and unweighted estimates. However, this is misleading because the only rows you can see here correspond to very young children, and all US-resident infants are also in fact US-born. So all the numbers are above 95% US-born. But once you start looking at every other age group, the story is going to change. And so without further ado, let\u2019s draw a plot\u2026 birth_country |> tidyr :: pivot_longer ( cols = c (us_born_unweighted, us_born_weighted), names_to = \"method\" , values_to = \"us_born\" , names_prefix = \"us_born_\" ) |> ggplot2 :: ggplot (ggplot2 :: aes ( x = age_yr, y = us_born, colour = method )) + ggplot2 :: geom_smooth ( method = \"loess\" , formula = y ~ x ) + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( size = 2 ) + ggplot2 :: facet_wrap ( ~ sex_fct) + ggplot2 :: theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) I\u2019ve used loess regression rather than gamlss regression because I honestly do not have the energy to fit more gamlss models, but you\u2019ll get roughly the same results with any flexible regression method. Looking at the plots, you can see that some aspects to the story remain the same no matter how you analyse the data: the proportion of overseas-born US residents is highest among people aged around 40 or thereabouts. Ingoring the sample weights (red curves) doesn\u2019t distort the correct answer (blue curves) in that respect, or at least not by very much. But that\u2019s about the only thing it doesn\u2019t distort. In every other respect the differences between the blue curves and the red curves are huuuuuuuuuge. The oversampling focuses on groups that are more likely to have been born outside the US, so inevitably it turns out that the sample weights make a huge difference. If you forget to look at the survey weights you\u2019d think that only 60% of middle-aged US residents were born in the US. Taking survey weights into account, however, we see that the correct answer is closer to 80%. That\u2026 yeah, that matters. In short \u2013 sometimes survey weights don\u2019t affect your results, but sometimes they really, really do. Epilogue \ud83e\udde0 : But seriously though, why did you make me do all this? I get that you always feel anxiety anytime you realise that there was some imperfection in something we\u2019ve done in the past, but it wasn\u2019t too hard to convince ourselves that the imperfection in question didn\u2019t affect anything of importance that we actually did. Doesn\u2019t this feel like overkill to you? \ud83e\udec0 : Maybe, I guess, but admit it\u2026 you feel better knowing that we investigated properly and documented the nature of our thinking in a way that might help other people who could also be tripped up the same way. You do, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you get a sense of joy and love from doing this? \ud83e\udde0 : Not really? You\u2019re the one with the heart emoji, babe. You\u2019re the touchy-feely one who wants so desperately to help people, and who panics disproportionately at even the smallest possibility of us having made a mistake. I\u2019m the one who actually has to do the reading and build the bloody models. This shit is exhausting. \ud83e\udec0 : Okay I get that, but also\u2026 isn\u2019t it possible that my anxiety is the thing that motivates us both to learn new things, and my need to help others is the thing that drives us to make the blog posts that people like so much? \ud83e\udde0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udde0 : I guess. But it\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting paid for this shit sweetie. We\u2019re doing this almost entirely out of the goodness of your heart, not mine. I\u2019d have preferred to spend my weekend on something else. We could have read a book, watched some TV, or\u2026 you know, lived our own lives. Doesn\u2019t that also seem worthy to you? Is anxiety and a desperate desire to be loved really a rational basis for choosing your behaviour? \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : Fair point but\u2026 would you really want to be one of those people who only does things for the love of money? Do want to be someone whose only real goal in life is to make number go up in the bank balance? \ud83e\udde0 : I\u2026 suppose not. But like\u2026 could you possibly just chill the fuck out sometimes? The anxiety is a bit over the top my dear, and it\u2019s not that pleasant to live with. \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : Maybe? Look, I\u2019ll try, okay? No promises. \ud83e\udde0 : Sigh. Resources For a post like this one, where I don\u2019t have strong expertise of my own and am writing it with the primary goal of improving my skills, I\u2019m a little wary about suggesting references for others. But for what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s some open access resources I relied on while writing this post: The NHANES study design tutorial provides a helpful overview of how to work with the sample weights that come supplied with the NHANES data. Along similar lines, I found it helpful to compare their notes with the weights page on the Australian Survey of Income and Housing website. There\u2019s a nice page on the Pew Research Center website containing notes by Andrew Mercer, Arnold Lau, and Courtney Kennedy on how different weighting methods work . If you read it on its own it\u2019s brief and helpful, is a nice entry point if you\u2019re an inveterate experimentalist at heart and survey data isn\u2019t your strength. Better yet, it\u2019s not a standalone document, it\u2019s acutally part of a much more comprehensive report on weighting online opt-in samples , so it gives you ample opportunity to branch out. One field in which I know these issues arise often is epidemiology, so it came as little surprise to me to discover that there is a useful chapter on survey analysis chapter contained within The Epidemiologist R Handbook . Another resource I found useful is this online book on how to weight a survey by Josep Espasa Reig. One nice thing about this one is that it\u2019s an informal walkthrough using examples in R, and it\u2019s intended to be readable by social scientists without any much expertise in the area. On the software side, here are a few tools I started investigating: the survey R package by Thomas Lumley, and the srvyr package that provides a dplyr -like syntax for it. In addition, after I shared this post on social media several people suggested additional reading material to look at. David Okunlola pointed me to this paper on subpopulation analysis Carl Pearson pointed me to some good discussion on statsexchange , and to another useful blog post on [different kinds of weights] by Thomas Lumley Samer Mouksassi pointed me to some work that he\u2019s done with longitudinal weights Brady West pointed me to this annual review article \u201cAre survey weights needed\u201d Ben Schneider mentioned Andrew Gelman\u2019s \u201cstruggles with survey weights\u201d paper and this reply . Stas Kolenikov very kindly shared a treasure trove of great links: Pfeffermann 1996 Binder and Roberts 2003 Heeringa, West, and Berglund A photo of what an NHANES MEC unit looks like So\u2026 I suppose I have more reading to do Footnotes Aside from, oh idk, just a lil hypothetical here, an authoritarian government gutting science funding, branding scientists as traitors for researching the wrong topics, threatening researchers, and gluing the cobblestones on the road to fascism in place using the blood and tears of those scientists that have the gall to care about human beings that aren\u2019t themselves.\u21a9\ufe0e I am currently giving very serious side eye at Uri Simonsohn in this regard. Stop being a dick, dude. You fucked up because you ventured outside your area of expertise, and you\u2019ve been gently corrected in the literature by people who know this stuff better than you do. And that\u2019s okay, as long as you stop doubling down on the mistake. Just a thought from a girl who no longer has skin in that particular game.\u21a9\ufe0e I suppose if you really want to check you can take a look at the git log on the blog repo and confirm that yep, I\u2019m writing this introductory section before writing any of the code to investigate the mistake. The anxiety is real.\u21a9\ufe0e I mean, it\u2019s now been about 5 years since the last time I actually ran an experiment of my very own. I\u2019m a data analyst by trade now, and unlike my old discipline of mathematical psychology where analysts tend to also run their own experiments, pharmacometricians tend not to conduct the studies they analyse themselves. Nevertheless, both disciplines are built atop a foundation of experimental science, and I notice that pharmacometricians tend to think in ways I find very familiar as a former math psych girl.\u21a9\ufe0e My sincere thanks to Benjamin Rich and Thomas Lumley who, in different contexts, both found very gentle ways to point me in the right direction. I mean, I did sort of know I had to think about this but I just\u2026 didn\u2019t.\u21a9\ufe0e In my defence, I was not an idiot. I was an analyst operating under time pressure, and I missed a detail that in hindsight I should have paid more attention to. Sigh. But it happens to us all, and in an attempt to practice what I preach, I\u2019m admitting it openly.\u21a9\ufe0e As another example, here\u2019s the Australian Survey of Income and Housing , and lo and behold it has a page explicitly discussing survey weights for the study.\u21a9\ufe0e You can inspect the code to see the actual calculations but in short, I used the \u201cMEC\u201d weights (weights associated with the data collected via the mobile examination centre) and - noting that the weights are commensurate over this period, constructed the 10-year weight by dividing the 2-year weight by 5 when the data for 5 2-year cycles are aggregated. The NHANES study design tutorial goes into details on this.\u21a9\ufe0e You know who you are. We\u2019ve all made this mistake once or twice \u263a\ufe0f. \u2019Tis the nature of the beast if you\u2019re working as an applied data analyst at the coalface. You get slammed with client requests that come in faster than you can handle, always with an externally-imposed deadline that you cannot change. You do the best you can in the limited timeframe that is permitted. That\u2019s all you can do.\u21a9\ufe0e Amusing side-note. It\u2019s always worth remembering that race and ethnicity categories aren\u2019t \u201cnatural categories\u201d in the sense that they map onto true and unyielding permanent categories in the world. When I work for Japanese clients, for example, their data set use race and ethnicity categories that are defined completely differently to how American clients define these things. Australian data sets define these things differently from American data sets also. The somewhat artificial nature of these categories means you should be careful when working with them in data sets, but also (and more entertainingly) lead to hilarious side effects. The formal definition of \u201cHispanic\u201d as used in a lot of US surveys is constructed around family ancestry, and usually around whether you or your parents were born in a Spanish-speaking country. Hilariously, to my mind, Spain is not excluded from the list of countries. So if your family comes from Spain (as mine does on one side) you are \u201ctechnically\u201d Hispanic, but not if your family comes from Portugal. Yes this is absurd. It means that the US considers me Hispanic. By any common sense understanding of what \u201cHispanic\u201d refers to, I am not Hispanic. But that is the nature of administrative categories: they are crude.\u21a9\ufe0e Reuse CC BY 4.0 Citation BibTeX citation: @online{navarro2025,\n  author = {Navarro, Danielle},\n  title = {Some Notes on Survey Weights},\n  date = {2025-09-27},\n  url = {https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/},\n  langid = {en}\n} For attribution, please cite this work as: Navarro, Danielle. 2025. \u201cSome Notes on Survey Weights.\u201d September 27, 2025. https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/ .",

What the actual fuck is wrong with you?</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p>The worst thing about being a scientist<sup>1</sup> is the fact that no matter how hard you work and no matter how diligent you are in learning skills that fall outside your core discipline, you will on a regular basis get slammed by <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem\">outside context problems</a>. You are trained to work within a particular framework, and you are exquisitely skilled at handling situations that fall within the scope of that framework. You are, almost by definition, a <em>specialist</em>. The days of the \u201crenaissance polymath\u201d are well and truly behind us, simply because science has advanced so far that no human mind can encompass the whole bloody thing at this point. It\u2019s impossible.</p>\n<p>This is of course a great triumph for science, but a terrible tragedy for the scientist who will <em>always</em> find themselves getting fucked over badly the moment \u201cthe thing I was trained for\u201d turns out to require knowledge from \u201cone of the million other things I was not trained for\u201d.

All the time. It\u2019s a core part of the job, actually. The trick, if you\u2019re a newly minted scientist hoping to survive in the badlands of real research, is to remain humble in the face complexity. When \u2013 not if \u2013 it happens to you, and you make a mistake, the thing you have to do own it and admit you were wrong.<sup>2</sup> Nobody with a shred of integrity will think less of you for admitting a mistake.</p>\n<p>And so it is in this spirit that I have to admit there\u2019s a mistake in my <a href=\"../../posts/2025-09-07_gamlss/\">GAMLSS post</a>. As of this exact moment of writing I don\u2019t know for certain how bad the mistake is because I haven\u2019t checked yet.<sup>3</sup> I have some reason to think my mistake isn\u2019t <em>terrible</em>, but I don\u2019t know for sure, and I\u2019m about to find out as soon as I write the rest of this post.</p>\n<p>Not gonna lie, I\u2019m a bit nervous.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"survey-weights\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">Survey weights</h2>\n<p>The mistake I made in that post is one that experimentalists such as myself<sup>4</sup> are particularly prone to. I took data from a structured, stratified survey \u2013 in this case the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/\">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a> (NHANES) \u2013 and analysed it as if it were a simple random sample, which it most certainly is not. In short, I forgot to consider <strong>survey weights.</strong> The mistake is embarrassing to me because the NHANES website has an entire <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/sampledesign.aspx\">study design tutorial</a> that talks specifically about this issue<sup>5</sup> and like an idiot<sup>6</sup> I didn\u2019t take it into account. Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.</p>\n<p>To understand the nature of my mistake, all you need to do is read the first paragraph of the NHANES tutorial discussing the design of the study:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>The NHANES samples are not simple random samples. Rather, a complex, multistage, probability sampling design is used to select participants representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population. Oversampling of certain population subgroups is also done to increase the reliability and precision of health status indicator estimates for these particular subgroups. Researchers need to take this into account in their analyses by appropriately specifying the sampling design parameters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh. Right. Yeah. Guess which bitch forgot to do that? Guess which bitch is now all of a sudden remembering that <em>lots</em> of surveys use stratified sampling, <em>lot</em> of surveys use oversampling for populations of interest, and <em>lots</em> of surveys discuss survey weights quite prominently on their websites<sup>7</sup> in the hope that researchers don\u2019t make the exact mistake that she did, in fact, make? That\u2019s right, this bitch.</p>\n<p>Oops.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"what-do-survey-weights-do\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">What do survey weights do?</h2>\n<p>So let\u2019s start by thinking about what survey weights are supposed to do. Reduced to the simplest description I can think of, the idea is to introduce a correction factor that adjusts for whatever sampling biases are known to exist in the sample. Suppose, for example, an Australian survey were designed with an intentional 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. There might be reasons for doing this: the population of New South Wales is about 8,500,000 people, whereas Tasmania has only about 580,000 people or thereabouts. If we sampled Australians purely at random, our survey might not have enough Tasmanians in it to be able to say much about Tasmanian residents. Given the differences in population size, you\u2019d expect to see about 15 residents from New South Wales in the sample for every Tasmanian. That could be a problem if we have a need to understand state-by-state differences as well as understand the overall Australian population. Yes, we\u2019d be able to learn about Australia overall, but at the state level we\u2019d learn a lot more about New South Wales and Victoria than we would about Tasmania and South Australia. That\u2019s not ideal.</p>\n<p>Given this concern, then, we decide to adopt a 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. This means that any <em>individual</em> Tasmanian resident is 5x as likely to be included in the survey than any individual resident of New South Wales. We\u2019ll still end up with more people from New South Wales (because the actual population difference is 15x not 5x), but the final sample will now only have about 3x as many folks from New South Wales as from Tasmania. It\u2019s different, certainly, but we\u2019ll now be able to learn the things that we need to learn at the state-by-state level.</p>\n<p>The drawback to oversampling Tasmanians, however, is that the sample is now unrepresentative of the nation as a whole. If you want to construct estimates of some quantity for the whole nation, we have to give each NSW resident in the sample 5x the weight that we give to each Tasmanian, in order to correct for the Tasmanian oversampling. This correction factor is the <strong>survey weight</strong>, and it needs to be taken into account when analysing data from our survey.</p>\n<p>To be a little more precise about it, here\u2019s the description that the Australian Bureau of Statistics uses to describe survey weights as they apply to the Survey of Income and Housing:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Weighting is the process of adjusting results from a sample survey to infer results for the total in scope population whether that be persons or households. To do this, a weight is allocated to each sample unit (e.g.&nbsp;a person or a household). The weight is a value which indicates how many population units are represented by the sample unit. The first step in calculating weights for each unit is to assign an initial weight, which is the inverse of the probability of being selected in the survey. For example, if the probability of a household being selected in the survey was 1 in 600, then the household would have an initial weight of 600 (that is, it represents 600 households).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Crudely put, the survey weight is a measure of \u201chow many individuals in the population does this sampled row represent?\u201d. In my hypothetical survey with Tasmanian oversampling, each surveyed person from NSW represents 5x as many Australians as each surveyed Tasmanian, and hence those data should weighted 5x as highly when making calculations about Australia as a whole.</p>\n<p>So now we return to my <a href=\"../../posts/2025-09-07_gamlss/\">GAMLSS post</a> and it\u2019s clearer why the models I developed weren\u2019t ideal: the NHANES data set contains survey weights (in a few different forms, actually) and I forgot to take them into account when fitting my models for population height and weight. In hindsight, it\u2019s obvious really.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"how-bad-was-my-mistake\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">How bad was my mistake?</h2>\n<p>So let\u2019s revisit my GAMLSS modelling for the NHANES data set. The <code>nhanes</code> data frame shown below is very similar to the one I used last time, with two substantial differences: I\u2019ve restricted it to the 10 year period 2009-2018 and added a <code>survey_wt</code> column that constructs the appropriate 10-year survey weight for these data:<sup>8</sup></p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<details class=\"code-fold\">\nCode for NHANES data import and preprocessing\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb1\" style=\"background: #f1f3f5;\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb1-1\"><span class=\"co\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E;

There <strong>are</strong> systematic differences between the unweighted and weighted models, which show up the moment if we plot the differences between the two versions of the model on the y-axis, but the key thing here is to pay attention to the scale of the y-axis. Even for adults, where you might worry that systematic oversampling in NHANES might start to make a difference, the differences between the two models are never larger than a 2cm discrepancy:</p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<details class=\"code-fold\">\nCode for the residuals plot\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb7\" style=\"background: #f1f3f5;\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb7-1\">predict_quantiles_compare <span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">|&gt;</span> </span>\n<span id=\"cb7-2\">  ggplot2<span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">::</span><span class=\"fu\" style=\"color: #4758AB; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">ggplot</span>(</span>\n<span id=\"cb7-3\">    <span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">mapping =</span> ggplot2<span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">::</span><span class=\"fu\" style=\"color: #4758AB; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">aes</span>(</span>\n<span id=\"cb7-4\">      <span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">x =</span> age_yr,</span>\n<span id=\"cb7-5\">      <span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">y =</span> unweighted <span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">-</span> weighted, </span>\n<span id=\"cb7-6\">      <span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">color =</span> quantile</span>\n<span id=\"cb7-7\">    )</span>\n<span id=\"cb7-8\">  ) <span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">+</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb7-9\">  ggplot2<span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">::</span><span class=\"fu\" style=\"color: #4758AB; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">geom_hline</span>(<span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">yintercept =</span> <span class=\"dv\" style=\"color: #AD0000; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">0</span>) <span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">+</span> </span>\n<span id=\"cb7-10\">  ggplot2<span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">::</span><span class=\"fu\" style=\"color: #4758AB; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">geom_point</span>(<span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">size =</span> <span class=\"dv\" style=\"color: #AD0000; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">1</span>) </span></code></pre></div>\n</details>\n<div class=\"cell-output-display\">\n<div>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid figure-img\" src=\"https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/index_files/figure-html/predict-quantiles-residuals-age-1.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>This makes clear that I did make a mistake \u2013 that part is still true \u2013 but thankfully the discrepancies between what the correctly weighted model predicts and what my original unweighted model predicts are pretty small.

Very diligent of us. Much proud. Very detail. Et cetera. We can stop now, yes? We\u2019ve done our duty admirably, thanks to your whining and panic. It can end now, yes? No more words need to be written?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : \u2026<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Okay, about that\u2026<br /></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p>The truth is that I\u2019ve gotten lucky in my analyses, and so have all the other people who have used NHANES data the same way I have.<sup>9</sup> I forgot to take account of something that can matter, and I was fortunate enough that in my specific use cases it didn\u2019t matter. But the nature of luck is that you aren\u2019t always lucky. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. It is not too difficult to come up with examples where the survey weights really do matter, and the rest of the post will be devoted to a one such case. My example is a little artificial, but it will suffice.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this example I\u2019m going to focus on the data from the 2015-2018 period, corresponding to the 2-year release cycles labelled \u201cI\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d in the data files. As described in the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02-184-508.pdf\">sample design report</a> for this period, the oversampled subgroups during this period were:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<ul>\n<li>Hispanic persons;</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic black persons;</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic, non-black Asian persons;</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities at or below 185% of the federal poverty level; and</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities aged 0\u201311 years or 80 years and over.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The language is oddly stilted, presumably because the authors of the report are being admirably cautious and have defined the groups using a set of non-overlapping categories. But if we were to be a little more informal, we\u2019d notice that these are the oversampled demographics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hispanic people</li>\n<li>Black people</li>\n<li>Asian people</li>\n<li>Low-income people</li>\n<li>Young people</li>\n<li>Old people</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This makes sense for NHANES. I\u2019m not privvy to their decision making process but I think I can guess the logic: Hispanic, Black, and Asian demographics are oversampled for the same reason that Tasmanians are oversampled in my hypothetical survey at the beginning. They are minority demographics for which we might need to boost the sample size to allow group-by-group comparisons to work. In contrast, I suspect lower-income people, younger people, and older people are all oversampled because NHANES is primarily a survey about health and nutrition, and these three groups are at higher risk of concerns than the rest of the population.</p>\n<p>Noting all this, let\u2019s construct an example that deliberately exploits the structure of this oversampling in order to show why sample weights matter. One of the questions in the NHANES demographic survey asks about country of birth. The question is (on purpose, I suspect) quite coarse-grained. It just asks if you were born in the United States or not, that\u2019s it. Here\u2019s a version of the NHANES data that includes a column for <code>us_born</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<details class=\"code-fold\">\nCode for NHANES data import and preprocessing\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb8\" style=\"background: #f1f3f5;\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb8-1\"><span class=\"co\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E;

In this case that is <em>especially</em> important, because we know that oversampling is related to race and ethnicity, and we also know on the basis of commonsense that country of bith will also be related to race and ethnicity.<sup>10</sup> A well-constructed analysis of <code>us_born</code> as an outcome variable should include these as explicit covariates.</p>\n<p>However.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to do that.

Ingoring the sample weights (red curves) doesn\u2019t distort the correct answer (blue curves) in that respect, or at least not by very much. But that\u2019s about the only thing it doesn\u2019t distort. In every other respect the differences between the blue curves and the red curves are huuuuuuuuuge. The oversampling focuses on groups that are more likely to have been born outside the US, so inevitably it turns out that the sample weights make a huge difference. If you forget to look at the survey weights you\u2019d think that only 60% of middle-aged US residents were born in the US. Taking survey weights into account, however, we see that the correct answer is closer to 80%. That\u2026 yeah, that matters.</p>\n<p>In short \u2013 sometimes survey weights don\u2019t affect your results, but sometimes they really, really do.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"epilogue\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">Epilogue</h2>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : But seriously though, why did you make me do all this?

Doesn\u2019t this feel like overkill to you?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Maybe, I guess, but admit it\u2026 you feel better knowing that we investigated properly and documented the nature of our thinking in a way that might help other people who could also be tripped up the same way.

This shit is exhausting.<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Okay I get that, but also\u2026 isn\u2019t it possible that my anxiety is the thing that motivates us both to learn new things, and my need to help others is the thing that drives us to make the blog posts that people like so much?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : \u2026<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : I guess.

I\u2019d have preferred to spend my weekend on something else. We could have read a book, watched some TV, or\u2026 you know, lived our own lives. Doesn\u2019t that also seem worthy to you?

If you read it on its own it\u2019s brief and helpful, is a nice entry point if you\u2019re an inveterate experimentalist at heart and survey data isn\u2019t your strength. Better yet, it\u2019s not a standalone document, it\u2019s acutally part of a much more comprehensive report on <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2018/01/26/for-weighting-online-opt-in-samples-what-matters-most/\">weighting online opt-in samples</a>, so it gives you ample opportunity to branch out.</p></li>\n<li><p>One field in which I know these issues arise often is epidemiology, so it came as little surprise to me to discover that there is a useful chapter on <a href=\"https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/survey_analysis.html\">survey analysis</a> chapter contained within <a href=\"https://epirhandbook.com/en/\">The Epidemiologist R Handbook</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another resource I found useful is this online book on <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/jespasareig/Book_How_to_weight_a_survey/\">how to weight a survey</a> by Josep Espasa Reig.

Stop being a dick, dude. You fucked up because you ventured outside your area of expertise, and you\u2019ve been gently corrected in the literature by people who know this stuff better than you do. And that\u2019s okay, as long as you stop doubling down on the mistake. Just a thought from a girl who no longer has skin in that particular game.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn3\"><p>I suppose if you really want to check you can take a look at the git log on the blog repo and confirm that yep, I\u2019m writing this introductory section <em>before</em> writing any of the code to investigate the mistake. The anxiety is real.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn4\"><p>I mean, it\u2019s now been about 5 years since the last time I actually <em>ran</em> an experiment of my very own. I\u2019m a data analyst by trade now, and unlike my old discipline of mathematical psychology where analysts tend to also run their own experiments, pharmacometricians tend not to conduct the studies they analyse themselves. Nevertheless, both disciplines are built atop a foundation of experimental science, and I notice that pharmacometricians tend to think in ways I find very familiar as a former math psych girl.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn5\"><p>My sincere thanks to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminrichphd/\">Benjamin Rich</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-lumley\">Thomas Lumley</a> who, in different contexts, both found very gentle ways to point me in the right direction. I mean, I did sort of know I had to think about this but I just\u2026 didn\u2019t.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn6\"><p>In my defence, I was not an idiot. I was an analyst operating under time pressure, and I missed a detail that in hindsight I should have paid more attention to. Sigh. But it happens to us all, and in an attempt to practice what I preach, I\u2019m admitting it openly.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn7\"><p>As another example, here\u2019s the Australian <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/concepts-sources-methods/survey-income-and-housing-user-guide-australia/2019-20\">Survey of Income and Housing</a>, and lo and behold it has a page explicitly discussing <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/concepts-sources-methods/survey-income-and-housing-user-guide-australia/2019-20/weights\">survey weights</a> for the study.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn8\"><p>You can inspect the code to see the actual calculations but in short, I used the \u201cMEC\u201d weights (weights associated with the data collected via the mobile examination centre) and - noting that the weights are commensurate over this period, constructed the 10-year weight by dividing the 2-year weight by 5 when the data for 5 2-year cycles are aggregated. The <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/sampledesign.aspx\">NHANES study design tutorial</a> goes into details on this.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn9\"><p>You know who you are. We\u2019ve all made this mistake once or twice \u263a\ufe0f. \u2019Tis the nature of the beast if you\u2019re working as an applied data analyst at the coalface. You get slammed with client requests that come in faster than you can handle, always with an externally-imposed deadline that you cannot change. You do the best you can in the limited timeframe that is permitted. That\u2019s all you can do.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn10\"><p>Amusing side-note. It\u2019s always worth remembering that race and ethnicity categories aren\u2019t \u201cnatural categories\u201d in the sense that they map onto true and unyielding permanent categories in the world. When I work for Japanese clients, for example, their data set use race and ethnicity categories that are defined completely differently to how American clients define these things. Australian data sets define these things differently from American data sets also. The somewhat artificial nature of these categories means you should be careful when working with them in data sets, but also (and more entertainingly) lead to hilarious side effects. The formal definition of \u201cHispanic\u201d as used in a lot of US surveys is constructed around family ancestry, and usually around whether you or your parents were born in a Spanish-speaking country. Hilariously, to my mind, Spain is <em>not</em> excluded from the list of countries. So if your family comes from Spain (as mine does on one side) you are \u201ctechnically\u201d Hispanic, but not if your family comes from Portugal. Yes this is absurd. It means that the US considers me Hispanic. By any common sense understanding of what \u201cHispanic\u201d refers to, I am not Hispanic. But that is the nature of administrative categories: they are crude.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n</ol>\n</section><section class=\"quarto-appendix-contents\" id=\"quarto-reuse\"><h2 class=\"anchored quarto-appendix-heading\">Reuse</h2><div class=\"quarto-appendix-contents\"><div><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" rel=\"license\">CC BY 4.0</a></div></div></section><section class=\"quarto-appendix-contents\" id=\"quarto-citation\"><h2 class=\"anchored quarto-appendix-heading\">Citation</h2><div><div class=\"quarto-appendix-secondary-label\">BibTeX citation:</div><pre class=\"sourceCode code-with-copy quarto-appendix-bibtex\"><code class=\"sourceCode bibtex\">@online{navarro2025,\n  author = {Navarro, Danielle},\n  title = {Some Notes on Survey Weights},\n  date = {2025-09-27},\n  url = {https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\n</code></pre><div class=\"quarto-appendix-secondary-label\">For attribution, please cite this work as:</div><div class=\"csl-entry quarto-appendix-citeas\" id=\"ref-navarro2025\">\nNavarro, Danielle. 2025. <span>\u201cSome Notes on Survey Weights.\u201d</span>\nSeptember 27, 2025. <a href=\"https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/\">https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/</a>.\n</div></div></section></div>"

        "full_content": "My previous post discussed 1918 vaccine studies, whose reliance on anecdotal evidence led to erroneous determinations of effectiveness. Shortcomings of the 1918 vaccine trials spurred statistical research on designing vaccine studies that ultimately led to the rigorous designs used today. Another statistical issue that hindered response to the 1918 pandemic was the lack of accurate, timely statistics about influenza cases and deaths. Some cities and states attempted to keep statistics of deaths, but only 33 states participated in the US Vital Statistics system. Vital statistics are exactly what the name implies: statistics related to life events. These typically include statistics about births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. In 1918, death statistics were needed to know the extent of fatalities caused by the influenza pandemic. Let\u2019s look at the death statistics available in 1918 and how they led to today\u2019s Vital Statistics systems. Vital Statistics in 1918 Schedule 3 of the 1850 census asked for a list all of the persons in the family who had died in 1850, along with their age, sex, color, occupation, and cause of death. This marked the first time the US government attempted to collect mortality statistics for all states, but the \u201creports were inaccurate and incomplete, and it became evident that reliable data could be obtained only from States and large cities that had efficient systems for the registration of these events\u201d (Hetzel, 1997, p. 9). The Bureau of the Census established a \u201cnational registration area\u201d for deaths in 1880. At first the registration area contained only two states (Massachusetts and New Jersey), but more states were admitted as they met the requirements of (1) adopting the standard death certificate, (2) enacting a Model State Vital Statistics law that specified registration procedures and duties of state registrars, and (3) establishing that at least 90 percent of deaths were captured by the system. In 1918, 33 of the 48 states, accounting for approximately 3/4 of the US population, had been admitted to the national registration area for deaths (see Figure 1). Figure 1. States in national death registration area, 1918. Dates of entry are from Dunn (1936) But wait a minute. A state could easily establish that it had enacted the model law and adopted the standard death certificate, but how could it verify that its registration system captured at least 90 percent of deaths? The registrar was supposed to record all known deaths. How could he \u00b9 know about deaths that were unrecorded by the system? Davis (1925, p. 399) wrote that a version of capture-recapture estimation was used: \u201cby obtaining from postmasters, rural carriers, and the clergy names of decedents in certain specified months. These names were then checked against the names on file in the official records of the state. If 90 per cent of the names thus gathered from the rural carriers and others were found on file the state was admitted to the area.\u201d But then state vital registration systems started relying on additional data from postmasters, rural carriers, and the clergy so that their information would be captured in the death statistics system (and could no longer be used to check its accuracy). In the mid-1920s, the Bureau of the Census switched to another method of estimating the percentage of state deaths captured by the registration system. They sent return-postage-paid postcards directly to households, asking the respondent to fill in the name and death date of anyone in the household who had died in the last 12 months. Both of these methods would likely underestimate the percentage of deaths captured by the vital registration system. Wilbur (1916) admitted that \u201cEven for the registration area for deaths as at present constituted, we do not have full assurance that the registration is uniformly complete in all states. The standard of admission is low\u201490 per cent\u2014and the means of testing the compliance therewith are inadequate.\u201d Davis (1925) commented on the unusually low death rates in several of the recently admitted southern states. It is quite likely that some states in the death registration areas were missing more than 10 percent of their deaths. The influenza pandemic, however, highlighted the inadequacy of the available statistics and spurred research on their improvement. Dunn (1936, p. 349) commented that the \u201cneed for new methods of testing completeness of registration is one of the most vital problems confronting the vital statistician.\u201d \u00b2 Vital Statistics Today By 1933, all 48 states had qualified to be part of the national death registration area. Compiling statistics was slow, however, because all records were on paper, and death statistics were typically released with a two-year time lag. In the early 2000s, the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) began switching over to electronic systems . The National Center for Health Statistics (2021) reported on some of the improvements to the NVSS resulting from data modernization efforts, including improved data quality and more complete information on causes of death. The final reports on mortality still have a nearly two-year lag, however. Provisional statistics are available earlier, but the NVSS modernization goal of \u201ca tool for real-time public health surveillance\u201d. The most recent provisional death statistics are from fourth quarter, 2024 for deaths from all causes and from third quarter, 2024 for deaths from specific causes such as homicide \u2014 almost a year after the last events of 2024. Vital statistics are integrated into so many processes and assessments of the nation\u2019s health that they are often taken for granted (National Research Council 2009, p. 3). The NVSS cooperation between local, state, and federal governments took decades to develop, however. The NVSS modernization program requires resources and continued cooperation and trust to achieve its goal \u201cto transform the National Vital Statistics System into a tool for real-time public health surveillance.\u201d Footnotes and References \u00b9I use the pronoun \u201che\u201d because official state registrars were men, but in several states women collected the statistics.

This marked the first time the US government attempted to collect mortality statistics for all states, but the \u201creports were inaccurate and incomplete, and it became evident that reliable data could be obtained only from States and large cities that had efficient systems for the registration of these events\u201d (Hetzel, 1997, p. 9). </p><p class=\"\">The Bureau of the Census established a \u201cnational registration area\u201d for deaths in 1880.

The whole idea of target trial emulation is clever and useful. The cleverness is as a communication tool: It helps avoid certain ambiguities by describing what researchers would have liked to do (and why), what was done, and the discrepancy between the two. This facilitates shared understanding and helps with critical appraisal. In that sense, target trial emulation was crying out for a reporting guideline. People who do target trials often testify that it clarifies their thinking about design (often the time zero stuff gets emphasised), and the Target statement in particular provides a structure that avoids missing certain blind-spots in reporting. As with most reporting guidelines, it is nominally about reporting, but sometimes \u2013 usefully, IMO \u2013 hints at what people should have done rather than how they report it. Personally, as someone whose bread-and-butter is randomised clinical trials, I find it helpful to understand what researchers would do if they could, deficiencies in the available data, and so on. I also like the emphasis on identifying assumptions. Despite the above praise, I will register two gripes. One is about what I see done; the other is about the Target statement itself. Gripe 1: Actual trials may not be target trials but describing a target trial does require good understanding of actual trials Target trial emulation is IMO particularly useful for communication with actual 3 trials people. The flip-side is that, to talk about a target trial, one must understand actual trials! In many descriptions of a \u201ctarget trial\u201d I see, there is huge ambiguity. I suspect this is because many people doing target trial emulation don\u2019t really know much about actual trials. One example is outcomes 4 . In actual trials, a lot of deliberation goes into outcome definition, measurement, review, and so on 5 . This seems to be treated fairly superficially in target trial emulation (see for example items 6e and 12 in the Target statement). In a sense this is understandable: you have what you have; different sites might be using different definitions; you might not really know the measurement protocol; etc. But of course, actual trials have these in-depth discussions because it matters, so highlighting discrepancies is important. It\u2019s exactly like the \u201ctime zero\u201d thing, but for some reason does not receive much emphasis. Gripe 2: Target statement leaves causal estimands translucent-to-opaque Defining a target trial helps to know what people would like to do. It\u2019s procedural. Some of its advocates claim that knowing this tells us exactly what people want to learn (the estimand). Nope. An estimand is a natural-language description of the effect we wish to learn about. For methodological work, this is often compressed into the mathematical notation of potential outcomes because it\u2019s useful for identification purposes (imagine writing out words every time instead of Y \u00b9 or Y (1)  whatever you write). Once we have a study design, we can work towards finding an identifying expression in terms of observable quantities (some people call this the \u201cstatistical estimand\u201d, which is [i] reasonable and [ii] confusing; net-bad). I think the idea in target trials is that the identifying expression should be trivially simple, like a simple comparison of means or whatever. That\u2019s fine, but trivially-simple identification still does not tell us what causal estimand is identifies. Something statisticians used to do all the time in actual trials \u2013 no doubt some still do \u2013 was to censor data after an intercurrent event, then analyse the ITT set (e.g. a Cox model for censored time-to-event outcomes, or a mixed model for quantitative outcomes). Amazingly, this was sometimes accompanied by a statement that the trial tests the effects of randomisation (implying treatment policy). This was not right; those censoring and estimation procedures targeted what we would now term a hypothetical strategy. The point is, there is often a discrepancy between what people claim they want (the estimand) and what they actually do (analysis approach). Saying what they want does not resolve the discrepancy, but without it we would not even know that there is one. They might think they are estimating one thing, you might assume something else. The point is, describing your target trial is great, but even that does not tell us the estimand. Also, given Hern\u00e1n\u2019s semantic quibbles (mostly wrong) about E9(R1) Addendum-style estimands 6 at EFSPI workshop , I\u2019m going to hit back and highlight a paragraph I\u2019ve been referred to several times in the past 7 , held up each time as the way to precisely define a \u201ccausal contrast\u201d. Read what you will into this picture of my boy a few years ago (noticing where the arrow is, and the boar). Disclaimer The above are observations from listening to quite a lot of presentations about target trial emulation, but I\u2019m certainly no expert. I want to re-emphasise that it can be a great communication tool and I will often jump to defend it. Just because something is frequently misunderstood or misused does not make it an inherently a bad idea (see also: Statistics ).

That&#8217;s fine, but trivially-simple identification still does not tell us what causal estimand is identifies.</p><p>Something statisticians used to do all the time in actual trials &#8211; no doubt some still do &#8211; was to censor data after an intercurrent event, then analyse the ITT set (e.g. a Cox model for censored time-to-event outcomes, or a mixed model for quantitative outcomes). Amazingly, this was sometimes accompanied by a statement that the trial tests the effects of randomisation (implying treatment policy). This was not right; those censoring and estimation procedures targeted what we would now term a <em>hypothetical</em> strategy. The point is, there is often a discrepancy between what people claim they want (the estimand) and what they actually do (analysis approach). Saying what they want does not resolve the discrepancy, but without it we would not even know that there is one. They might think they are estimating one thing, you might assume something else. The point is, describing your target trial is great, but even that does not tell us the estimand.</p><p>Also, given Hern&#225;n&#8217;s semantic quibbles (mostly wrong) about E9(R1) Addendum-style estimands<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a> at <a href=\"https://efspieurope.github.io/workshop/\">EFSPI workshop</a>, I&#8217;m going to hit back and highlight a paragraph I&#8217;ve been referred to several times in the past<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a>, held up each time as the way to precisely define a &#8220;causal contrast&#8221;.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p7iI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4e513ec-3788-4b62-8d1d-3f177d568dc9_550x298.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p7iI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4e513ec-3788-4b62-8d1d-3f177d568dc9_550x298.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Read what you will into this picture of my boy a few years ago (noticing where the arrow is, and the boar).</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bu5i!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57d339d0-0d3e-4abc-80ae-bd70d5f12101_505x864.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bu5i!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57d339d0-0d3e-4abc-80ae-bd70d5f12101_505x864.jpeg\" width=\"505\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h1>Disclaimer</h1><p>The above are observations from listening to quite a lot of presentations about target trial emulation, but I&#8217;m certainly no expert.

I said in the previous post that given three out of these six quantities you could solve for the other three. Then I dropped a footnote saying sometimes the missing quantities are uniquely determined but sometimes there are two solutions and you need more data to uniquely determine a solution. Todhunter\u2019s textbook on spherical trig gives a thorough account of how to solve spherical triangles under all possible cases. The first edition of the book came out in 1859. A group of volunteers typeset the book in TeX. Project Gutenberg hosts the PDF version of the book and the TeX source. I don\u2019t want to duplicate Todhunter\u2019s work here. Instead, I want to summarize when solutions are or are not unique, and make comparisons with plane triangles along the way. SSS and AAA The easiest cases to describe are all sides or all angles. Given three sides of a spherical triangle (SSS), you can solve for the angles, as with a plane triangle. Also, given three angles (AAA) you can solve for the remaining sides of a spherical triangle, unlike a plane triangle. SAS and SSA When you\u2019re given two sides and an angle, there is a unique solution if the angle is between the two sides (SAS), but there may be two solutions if the angle is opposite one of the sides (SSA). This is the same for spherical and plane triangles. ASA and AAS When you\u2019re given two angles and a side, there is a unique solution if the side is common to the two angles (ASA). If the side is opposite one of the angles (AAS), there may be two solutions to a spherical triangle, but only one solution to a plane triangle. This is because two angles uniquely determine the third angle in a plane triangle, but not in a spherical triangle. Summary Note that spherical triangles have a symmetry that plane triangles don\u2019t: the spherical column above remains unchanged if you swap S\u2019s and A\u2019s.

One of the key components of such an application is voice-to-text software. There are many nuances that trip up such software. One puzzle is homophones: since John and Jon are pronounced the same, how can the \"smart\" device decide which one was spoken? Humans encounter the same problem. We make the intention clear by saying \"John with the h\" or \"Jon without the h\". How does this issue arise with Chinese names? My friend Ray V. sent me to a nice data visualization project by Liuhuaying Yang tackling this tricky subject. The situation with Chinese names is even more complex. Chinese names are made up of ordered characters (typically one, possibly two, characters for the surname, and typically one or two, possibly three, characters for the \"given name\"). The surname is written before the given name. Each character is a single syllable. Homophones are numerous. The designer illustrates this as a tree: This \"li\" tree contains forty \"fruits,\" each being a Chinese character sharing the same sound. If all one has is \"Li,\" it could be any of these characters (of course, some are more likely than others.) Thus, Li has to augment \"li\" by saying something like \"the 'li' as used in pear.\" Jon without the h. The situation is a bit better if the name is spoken out loud, because the \"tone\" is heard. Mandarin Chinese uses four tones, indicated by the color of the fruit in the tree above. Only three tones appear there, so apparently the first tone of \"li\" (shown in pink) is rarely used in Chinese names. In written text, the tone indicator is usually dropped, making it much harder to figure out which of these \"li\"s is the right one. The canopy of the tree casts a shadow on the ground, the size of which encodes the difficulty of the puzzle. According to their statistics, the 40 \"li\"s show up in given names with a popularity of 38 per thousand people. If you look more closely, there are two shadows. The thicker shadow is related to surname usage while the thinner one, usage in given names. One of the \"li\"s is one of the top five surnames in China, and so the thicker shadow is the outer one (76 per thousand). The writeup neglected to explain the two shadow rings. So, let's find one that has the opposite characteristic as \"li\" for comparison. \"Rong\" is rarely a surname so the thicker shadow is right at the base of the trunk while the thinner shadow related to given names is more visible. Interestingly, only one of the four tones appears in this \"rong\" tree. Returning to the \"li\" tree, let's analyze \"Li\" as a surname. The character in green is the second most common surname in China, but there are about a dozen other characters that can be someone's family name. Unsurprisingly, many of these characters only show up in given names. Because they are using the tint of the color to show relative popularity, we don't really know the drop in popularity relative to the green character (it's a huge drop-off). The value of this data visualization project is in structuring and presenting the data in a way that engages readers. This is a project that keeps readers focused on the trees, while losing themselves inside the forest, hopefully at will. Enter the forest of Chinese names here .",

However, they generally operate in static, researcher-controlled settings in which human analysts collect data, recalculate priors, and interpret results. The emerging agentic Bayesian architecture transforms this model into an autonomous ecosystem. Instead of manual intervention, intelligent agents now collect evidence, interpret meaning, and update probabilistic beliefs in real time. At the heart of this architecture lies the following tri-agent workflow, in which each agent plays a specialized role in maintaining an adaptive decision loop: Data Agent: Continuously ingests and cleans evidence from live data streams such as IoT sensors, supplier reports, or social sentiment feeds. It translates messy real-world inputs into structured quantitative evidence. Inference Agent: Performs Bayesian updates dynamically, computing posterior distributions as fresh evidence arrives and refining beliefs on the fly, rather than through periodic recalibration. Interpretation Agent: Converts posterior shifts into narratives, explanations, or policy recommendations understandable to human decision-makers or autonomous subsystems. This architecture forms the basis of a continuously learning system\u2014one that not only learns but explains how it learns, anchoring human trust in machine reasoning. Inside an Adaptive Supply Chain Bayesian Network To illustrate, consider a global supply chain monitoring system. Traditionally, reliability models might flag a supplier only when delays exceed a preset threshold. By contrast, an agentic Bayesian model treats each supplier\u2019s reliability \u0398i \u03b8i as an evolving random variable. When new data Dt Dt (for example, a delay report or negative sentiment) arrives, the inference agent applies the recursive update: P(\u03b8i\u2223D1:t)\u221dP(Dt\u2223\u03b8i)P(\u03b8i\u2223D1:t\u22121) P ( \u03b8i \u2223 D 1: t )\u221d P ( Dt \u2223 \u03b8i ) P ( \u03b8i \u2223 D 1: t \u22121) The posterior P(\u03b8i\u2223D1:t) P ( \u03b8i \u2223 D 1: t ) becomes the new belief state, immediately available to the interpretation agent, which can alert managers that \u201cSupplier X\u2019s reliability decreased from 0.8 to 0.72; probability of stockout increased by 15%.\u201d This dynamic updating loop captures the essence of Bayesian adaptivity at operational scale. It enables organizations to not only react faster to disruptions but to anticipate them. Decisions become both data-driven and self-adjusting, moving from risk detection toward predictive mitigation. From Statistical Models to Agentic Ecosystems The transition from static Bayesian models to autonomous Bayesian ecosystems represents more than a technical shift; it\u2019s a conceptual leap. Traditional models assume a closed environment in which data is gathered, processed, and analyzed in stages. Bayesian decision agents replace this static workflow with a living ecosystem of interconnected, autonomous models that share and update probabilistic knowledge continuously. This flexibility allows organizations to maintain coherent reasoning across changing contexts without manual recalibration. Each agent specializes, collaborates, and communicates through structured probabilistic reasoning, producing a form of collective intelligence. Uncertainty becomes fuel for continuous adaptation, rather than an obstacle to precision. Research Implications and Future Directions The agentic Bayesian framework intersects statistics, computer science, and autonomous decision theory, inviting new interdisciplinary exploration. The following promising directions are emerging: Hierarchical Bayesian Agents: These agents manage uncertainty across multiple levels (e.g., from product lines to regions or time horizons). Upper-level priors evolve based on the aggregated experience of lower-level agents, maintaining coherence across scales. Bayesian-Reinforcement Learning Integration: In this hybrid, posteriors feed directly into policy updates, allowing agents to make decisions reflecting both empirical evidence and real-time feedback. The result is a framework that learns both the world\u2019s structure and the best strategies to act within it. Explainable Bayesian Narratives: Combining large language models with Bayesian inference allows interpretation agents to describe posterior changes in natural language, bridging the gap between mathematical reasoning and human comprehension. Federated Bayesian Ecosystems: This direction focuses on distributed inference across organizational or jurisdictional boundaries, allowing collaborative model learning without centralizing proprietary or sensitive data. It ensures privacy while fostering shared intelligence networks. Each pathway extends Bayesian principles into new computational and organizational domains, positioning Bayesian decision agents as the backbone of future collaborative reasoning systems. The Cognitive Infrastructure for Real-Time Decision-Making Modern decision environments\u2014financial markets, logistics networks, disaster response systems\u2014demand not just intelligence, but intelligence that updates itself. Bayesian decision agents bring this capability by combining statistical rigor with adaptive autonomy. Their strength lies in codifying uncertainty through clear probabilistic structures while adapting with the fluidity of autonomous agents. Unlike static models locked to historical calibration, Bayesian agents live within their environment, continuously sensing, modeling, and explaining what they learn. This paradigm shift also enhances governance and transparency. Interpretive agents ensure decision rationales remain trackable and auditable, crucial for regulatory compliance and trust in automated systems. By internalizing both inference and interpretation, Bayesian architectures balance autonomy with accountability. As these systems evolve, they will redefine analytical workflows, from one-time analyses toward living decision processes that improve with every observation. In such ecosystems, uncertainty is no longer managed through periodic reporting; it is continuously reasoned over, explained, and acted upon. The emergence of Bayesian decision agents signals a fundamental evolution in how organizations operate under uncertainty. By embedding Bayesian logic within autonomous agent frameworks, decision-making becomes proactive, interpretable, and self-improving. These agents maintain an ongoing conversation between data, inference, and interpretation, transforming risk perception into continuous strategic foresight. In complex, fast-changing environments, this approach offers a resilient foundation for intelligent systems that think probabilistically, learn autonomously, and explain their reasoning transparently. The result is a new class of decision intelligence infrastructure that does not merely analyze the world but learns to anticipate how the world itself will change.

Half are written and edited with LLMs.\n\nThose two groups aren't exclusive.\n\nIt's easy to get lost -- pulled into anger and frustration on the one hand, or into irrational exuberance on the other -- but if you're one of the few whose job is relatively safe, you still need to try and sort the useful from the useless.\n\nBut that's hard because the online information ecosystem is collapsing.\n\n## Roll back the clock, please and thank you\n\nIt would be great if we could just get back to the imperfect web we had.\n\nMuch of it was nonsense, sure, but once you got past the grifters and the obvious nonsense, quite a few people -- especially in tech -- were writing, talking, and making videos on subjects that mattered to them, personally, that they could speak to with some authority or experience.\n\nIf you wanted to figure out how to set up a *Caddy* web server on your chosen host with the configuration you needed, odds were a quick search would lead you to a blog post where somebody had done just that and been nice enough to document how they did it.\n\nToday, the same search is likely to lead you to a multitude of texts that *look* like blog posts of that exact genre, written by humans, except they're filled with fabrications and nonsense, attributing features to the software it does not have, using configuration parameters that don't work, and citing versions that don't exist.\n\nThe old web information ecosystem is gone. It's not coming back.\n\n## The web is people\n\nA complex system that's no longer getting the energy, work, and input needed to counteract the forces pulling it apart *will collapse.*\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to say that it's physics, but it's the nearest sociocultural equivalent to a certainty.\n\nBut collapse doesn't necessarily mean that the communities or people disappear.\n\nCollapse means fragmentation.\n\nWe don't know exactly how it'll fragment -- how the pieces will shape up or how they will work -- but one thing we do know:\n\n*The web we read will be made up of people we trust.*\n\nThat's it. That's the only way we know how to counter the flood of chatbots, grifters, con artists, and fabrications. We pick the people we trust to write on a topic or problem and, in exchange, we support their work in some way.\n\nPaid newsletters are definitely a part of that. As are forms of patronage and sponsorship.\n\nBut there's a limit to how many subscriptions any of us can commit to. Subscriptions are a commitment and the times are precarious. We also don't get much for that commitment, as readers.\n\n- Emails, even paid, get shuffled off into archives, never to be revisited, and an email app isn't the greatest reading environment to begin with.\n- Platforms act like attention roach motels, undermining our efforts at structuring and directing our attention.\n- Even online courses tie you to platforms and connections that may or may not be reliable in the long run.\n\nEbooks aren't a bad deal in comparison. They are self-contained. The formats are standardised. You pay once and you get files you can keep.\n\nCompared to the $60-120 USD per year you often pay for a professional or field-specific newsletter -- one that usually doesn't even deliver a book's worth of analysis in that year -- an ebook is a great deal.\n\nBut it's also what pays for most of the newsletter. Ultimately, people buying the ebooks is what gives writers like me the time and space to write our newsletters in the first place.\n\nSo, for this Black Friday -- running until Monday, 1 December -- I'm bringing back my *Everything Bundle*, which contains all of my ebooks, for one last hurrah.\n\n## The end of the 'Everything Bundle'\n\nFour ebooks for *\u20ac49 EUR*, at an almost **60% discount** off the combined price.\n\nWhat's more, after the Black Friday sale, I'm going to discontinue two of the four ebooks.\n\n***I am Uncluttered (Yellow)* will only be available in the print edition and the archival ebook *Bad Writing* will no longer be on sale for the foreseeable future.**\n\nI'm still happy with the books -- genuinely proud of them, even -- but I need to, well, *unclutter* the books I offer, and it makes sense to de-emphasise books that are targeting web development, the one industry that seems less likely to recover from it's infatuation with Large Language Models or React in the near future.\n\nThe \u20ac49 EUR bundle includes:\n\n- [_Out of the Software Crisis: Systems-Thinking for Software Projects_](https://softwarecrisis.baldurbjarnason.com/), an opinionated guide to the systems-thinking perspective on software development.\n- [_The Intelligence Illusion: a practical guide to the business risks of Generative AI_](https://illusion.baldurbjarnason.com/), an overview of the many risks and pitfalls of using generative models in your business backed by in-depth research.\n- [_I am Uncluttered (Yellow): doom-prepping web dev through disdain, disrespect, and doing the right thing_](/books/uncluttered-yellow/).\n- [_Bad Writing and Other Essays: Twenty-Five Years of Writing About the Digital Transformation_](/books/bad-writing/)\n\n<div class=\"Bundle\">\n\n<a href=\"https://payhip.baldurbjarnason.com/b/UwFnP\" class=\"Buy\">Buy the <em>Everything</em> Bundle for <strong>\u20ac49 EUR</strong></a>\n\n## <a href=\"https://softwarecrisis.baldurbjarnason.com/\">Out of the Software Crisis</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://softwarecrisis.baldurbjarnason.com/\"><img alt=\"Out of the Software Crisis by Baldur Bjarnason\" src=\"https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/img/out-of-the-software-crisis.jpg\" width=\"200\"></a>\n\nSoftware projects keep failing, not because we don't have the right team or tools but because our software development system is broken. _Out of the Software Crisis_ is a guide to fixing your software projects with systems-thinking making them more resilient to change and less likely to fail.\n\n<br clear=\"both\">\n\n### Praise for <em>Out of the Software Crisis</em>\n\n<div class=\"Praise sample\">\n\n> The only issue so far with @baldur's book is how distracted I am by the typography.

When times are good, everything you do seems to lead to growth. You begin to associate your random actions with random fluctuations in the market. Managers build mental models for how the market works that have no relation with reality.\u201d\n>\n> This is basically a book full of hot takes and I\u2019m here for it.\n>\n> [James Harton](https://social.coop/@jmshrtn/110006553406869645)\n\n> \"Out of the Software Crisis\" by @baldur is a great book and well worth the read. Highly quotable, and really challenged my view of software development in a few places.\n>\n> Too many great quotes, but here's one that hit me in the gut:\n>\n> \"Truly catastrophic software failures rarely get discovered in a sprint review or shipping retrospectives. The serious bugs that induce panic attacks only appear once the software is distributed widely enough to begin to experience edge cases. Most of the time, that only happens long after the software development team has moved on and marked the project as successful or challenged.\"\n>\n> [Nolan Lawson](https://toot.cafe/@nolan/109395899173521273)\n\n> Love this quote about design from \u201cOut of the software crisis\u201d by @fakebaldur: \u201cDecoration [is] the least important thing design does for software\u2026[aesthetics] is part of what design does.

It isn\u2019t used as much as a guide or resource, but as a way to get a lay of the land.\n>\n> [Jennifer Jiang](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5333828248)\n\n> This book \u201cout of the software crisis\u201d by @baldurbjarnason is really good \ud83d\udc4d\n>\n> I cannot recommend it highly enough\n>\n> [KimSia Sim](https://twitter.com/KimStacks/status/1614995513564078080)\n\n> Just finished @baldur\u2019s new book \u201cOut of the Software Crisis\u201d.

It\u2019s short, non-technical, well-researched and identifies the key reasons software projects fail and how to improve the chance of success.

Accessible for anyone who's spent more than 15 minutes with a clueless executive or myopic developer (or, frankly, engaged with any of the technological \"disruptions\" of the past two decades), Bjarnason rigorously unpacks the many risks involved with the most popular use cases being promoted by unscrupulous executives. He brings plenty of receipts to support his observations, too, while also spotlighting areas where this technology might have legitimate potential for good.

One of the things that\u2019s kept me busy was a trip to Kaiserslauten, to visit the Algorithmic Accountability Lab at the university there. This is a really useful and interesting research agenda, which has been very influential on European regulation. One of the main ideas is that there are at least two axes that need to be taken into consideration when you look at algorithmic decision systems \u2013 transparency and potential harm. So, for example, it doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of algorithm produces your Netflix recommendations, but if something is going to be used for job recruitment or predicting recidivism, it becomes important that its decisions are auditable. In discussions there, I think an interesting point arose that what we\u2019re really thinking about in this context is \u201cfailure modes\u201d, though. As Josh Loftus once said, nobody really cares about explainability of nice decisions \u2013 we only really want to know how to complain and appeal when a computer has done something nasty to us. And simpler algorithms have much more friendly failure modes \u2013 a decision tree, for example, either drops you into a \u201cdunno, speak to a human\u201d bucket, or assigns you to a category that\u2019s visibly inappropriate. At the other end of the spectrum, a neural network is quite likely to keep on plugging when it goes outside its area of expertise, generating spurious decisions in exactly the way that LLMs produce hallucinations. That might even be a good thing if it\u2019s doing something like film recommendations, but it gets more and more worrying as the significance and potential harm gets greater. Of course, I made my usual point that there\u2019s nothing really special about algorithms as non-human decision making systems, and that a lot of these principles are applicable to organisations as well.

        "raw_html": "<p>Hello again &#8211; sorry for the sporadic posting, this is going to be another week when busyness dictates it&#8217;s a short post today and a longer one on Friday rather than vice versa.</p><p>One of the things that&#8217;s kept me busy was a trip to Kaiserslauten, to visit the <a href=\"https://aalab.informatik.uni-kl.de/en/gruppe/zweig/\">Algorithmic Accountability Lab</a> at the university there. This is a really useful and interesting research agenda, which has been very influential on European regulation. One of the main ideas is that there are at least two axes that need to be taken into consideration when you look at algorithmic decision systems &#8211; transparency and potential harm. So, for example, it doesn&#8217;t really matter what kind of algorithm produces your Netflix recommendations, but if something is going to be used for job recruitment or predicting recidivism, it becomes important that its decisions are auditable.</p><p>In discussions there, I think an interesting point arose that what we&#8217;re really thinking about in this context is &#8220;failure modes&#8221;, though. As <a href=\"https://joshualoftus.com/\">Josh Loftus</a> once said, nobody really cares about explainability of nice decisions &#8211; we only really want to know how to complain and appeal when a computer has done something nasty to us. And simpler algorithms have much more friendly failure modes &#8211; a decision tree, for example, either drops you into a &#8220;dunno, speak to a human&#8221; bucket, or assigns you to a category that&#8217;s visibly inappropriate.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, a neural network is quite likely to keep on plugging when it goes outside its area of expertise, generating spurious decisions in exactly the way that LLMs produce hallucinations. That might even be a good thing if it&#8217;s doing something like film recommendations, but it gets more and more worrying as the significance and potential harm gets greater.</p><p>Of course, I made my usual point that there&#8217;s nothing really special about algorithms as non-human decision making systems, and that a lot of these principles are applicable to organisations as well. Many of the really important questions of AI ethics are actually the questions of legitimacy that political philosophers have been thinking about for ages. (And not just them &#8211; I was fascinated to discover that the AAL has one theologian).

Time series have become pervasive in psychological research and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models have become one of the most popular classes of models to study within-person dynamics in such data. However, systematic checking of how well a VAR model fits the data is hardly ever performed. This is a problem, because model misfit can lead both to incorrect interpretations of model parameters and to missing effects in the data that would be theoretically interesting. We provide a tutorial that explains the theory behind model checking, introduces the most common types of VAR model misspecification in the context of psychological time series, and introduces diagnostics for them, using plots and simulations. We then apply these tools to assess model fit for a multilevel VAR model estimated on a typical empirical dataset of emotion measurements over three weeks of 179 persons. We conclude by discussing three complementary areas of research that could improve the modeling of psychological time series in the future.

Schools are underfunded and public education is under attack. Lawmakers are banning or refusing to fund technology in classrooms, leaving poor and marginalized students at a significant disadvantage. This Giving Tuesday, you can make a difference by helping to fund a teacher\u2019s wishlis t. Help low income students access chemistry kits, where they can investigate gas laws and atomic structure in a safe and guided way. Or help provide a classroom with Arduino kits that will allow them to design, build, and test projects that bring engineering and coding to life. Children deserve the opportunity to learn and nurture their critical thinking skills. But they need your help. DonorsChoose is a fantastic organization that aggregates teachers\u2019 requests from across the country, and lets you pick which classroom projects or supplies to fund. I worked with DonorsChoose to create a full list of teachers that need your support . Take action today and change a child\u2019s life.

Over the years, Cable has helped craft numerous government, foundation, and university policies that ensure publicly funded educational resources are freely and openly available to all. Among many examples, he supported the U.S. Department of Labor and 800 community colleges in developing open educational resources (OER) through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program . Cable also co-created cornerstone CC initiatives including the Open Course Library , CC Certificate , CC Consulting Program , Open Education Platform , Institute for Open Leadership , Open Climate Campaign , Open Climate Data Project , and Open Preprints Project \u2013 collectively helping raise over $12 million to advance CC\u2019s mission.

        "full_content": "A new survey conducted by the Partnership for Public Service shows that most of the public is pessimistic about the management of the federal government and that cuts made by the Trump administration to the federal workforce and federal programs are having a negative impact on the country. The survey, conducted in October during the government shutdown, found that Americans say the government is moving in the \u201cwrong direction\u201d by more than a rate of 2-to-1. Fully 61% say the government is moving in the wrong direction compared with only 25% who say it is moving in the \u201cright direction.\u201d Another 13% are unsure. These new results come from a survey conducted by the Partnership in conjunction with AmeriSpeak Omnibus . The survey of 1,096 U.S. adults was conducted from Oct. 9-13, 2025, which was the second week of the government shutdown. The survey had a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points. While it is possible the shutdown impacted the views of survey respondents, the results are virtually identical to those expressed six months ago in a similar Partnership survey. Then, 30% said the government was moving in the right direction, and 58% said the government was moving in the wrong direction. The similarity between the two sets of results suggests that opinions about changes to the federal government have been steady and that external events may have only a limited effect on the public\u2019s views. A small shift among Republicans and independents Self-described Democrats and independents are especially negative about the direction of the government, while self-described Republicans are mostly positive. This was also the case six months ago . This discrepancy fits with previous Partnership research that shows partisanship is a clear factor in how the public views the federal government. While the overall numbers have not shifted much since April, there has been some movement among Republicans and independents, suggesting they are slightly less positive now than they were previously. Now, 59% of Republicans say the government is headed in the right direction, down 10 points from 69% in April. Among independents, 9% say the government is going in the right direction compared with 16% in April. These shifts are small and may be caused by several factors. It is possible the government shutdown impacted the October results. It is also possible that there has been tiny, but noticeable, movement among Republicans and independents toward a more negative\u2014or at least uncertain\u2014view of the government\u2019s direction. Most Americans oppose the changes made by the Trump administration More than twice as many Americans say the operating of the federal government has gotten worse. Fifty-eight percent say the government is operating \u201cworse today\u201d than a year ago compared with 26% who say it is operating \u201cbetter today.\u201d These numbers are virtually identical to the feelings expressed in April , even when considering partisan affiliations. Those numbers are also close to the views Americans express when specifically asked about the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s changes to the government. Fifty-nine percent of Americans say they think the impact will be negative compared with 28% who say it will be positive. These results are within the survey\u2019s margin of error compared with the survey conducted six months ago . Opinions appear to have crystallized These recent results are remarkably similar to those expressed in April. The results for the three different survey questions\u2014which ask about the management of the government in slightly different ways\u2014are very close to each other as well. While there has been some movement among Republicans and independents, those changes are small. It is premature to determine if this trend will continue. One conclusion is clear, however.\u00a0 Regardless of survey wording\u2014or whether the question was asked six months ago or just recently\u2014roughly twice as many Americans are troubled by the direction of the federal government than are supportive.

You can find it here . I find myself quoting Fukumi Shimura a lot lately. Dyer, weaver, and National Treasure of Japan, Fukumi Shimura (who recently turned 101!) wrote several short essays about her work, gathered in a sublime little book titled Iro wo Kanaderu , rendered in English as The Music of Color . She speaks of Kusakizome , which is botanical dyeing (\u201dplants and greass\u201d) as an act of \u201creceiving colours\u201d from nature, and I wanted to share this extract in particular: Receiving Color Sometimes people tell me about attempts at dyeing gone awry. I wanted this color, they say, so I used that plant, just like the book said, but the result wasn\u2019t what I expected. This has it backwards, I think. The colors we receive are already there, within the plants. Our task is simply to bring them across to our side unharmed, and give them somewhere to stay. In winter, trees stand in the snow, stoically waiting for spring and preparing to send forth new shoots when it arrives. When we take their trunks and branches for dyeing, we accept without reservation the colors we find within, and bring them to life in our weaving. Anything less would be a sin against nature. Every branch on a Japanese plum tree ( ume ) is densely covered in buds that were to be the blossoms of early spring, and this is the life that we receive. It is the color of a thousand, ten thousand plum branches\u2014their statement to the world. It falls to us to heed that statement and bring that very color to life. We cannot blend it with others\u2014cannot combine the plum and the sakura to create a new color. That would be a crime against the trees, because their colors are more than just colors. This beautifully articulated way of being resonated so deeply with me it made this aspect of my practice more conscious. The photos of her work made me long to dye without expectation and then put these fibres together and just see what comes of it. An idea for an art piece took shape, that may take all year to complete, which alongside gratitude to the plants is meant to reflect my gratitude for what life has given me this past year. It started with a shower of conkers, which I couldn\u2019t resist gathering to make ink\u2026 In the leftover dye I soaked, as an afterthought, a small skein of embroidery silk alongside one of linen, curious to see if and how they would each take up the dye. The result was subtle but pleasing, the linen dyed the deeper shade of the two. I couldn\u2019t have guessed this result, and the surprise was like an invitation. Subscribe now Next in line for this experiment was a batch of beautiful hawthorn berries. In my experience they could make a beautiful rust-coloured ink. Would they dye? Again the two types of fibre captured slightly different hues, with the linen more reddish than the silk. How interesting they would look together\u2026 A \u201cshortcut\u201d through the parks in October brought more discoveries (not such a shortcut after all). Walking past this bush, I felt compelled to stop at the sight of what appeared to be black rosehips, something completely new to me. That\u2019s exactly what they were as this was a Scotch rose ( Rosa spinosissima ). As soon as I put them in a pot with hot water and a pinch of alum, it became obvious they had much to offer. The skein when taken out after its long soak was a rich purple-red, though I was quite sure that it would dry to a much paler hue. In fact it ended up this beautiful silvery purple I didn\u2019t expect\u2026 The park also presented me with a whole field of mullein, a flower I only rarely caught sight of hitherto. Mullein is curious in that it requires an alkaline to give up its colour, where most yellow flowers require an acidic medium. I didn\u2019t expect any surprises this time but was very glad to add such a luminous hue to my palette. It dried to be a much more pastel yellow (pictured at the conclusion of this post). At this point I cheated ever so slightly. This summer I found I had access to a wonderful four hundred-year old mulberry, and as I miss the berries from home I visited it often and gorged myself with them, but I also froze a certain amount with the thought I could make sorbet once I was fully moved in. Mulberry juice is famously staining, so surely it should stain a little silk? Oh but it did, and was a feast for the eyes the whole time. The final result (after drying) was this ridiculously good pink slightly tinged with blue. I thought I had peaked there, but no. In late October, I walked past a neighbour\u2019s front garden just as they were pruning their almond tree. On a hunch but without expectation, I asked if I could take the prunings. I snipped the slender branches into small segments and simmered them with a little soda ash, only to find the water turned a strong red that really took me by surprise. But the question was what this would mean on my fibres. To my completed disbelief, after a couple of days of soaking my silk came out a deep copper. It had already been so promising in the early stages, above, that I had to try a second one for a briefer dip, and the result was this delicate salmon pink. At the time of writing, I\u2019ve had one more surprise that came from this wall belonging to Trinity College. Every year I admire it for its creeping vine\u2019s spectacular autumnal display. This time, once the leaves had fallen, I noticed the clusters of berries that had been growing in the background. This turned out to be a type of Virginia creepers (genus Parthenocissus ), though I\u2019m not sure of the exact species. I gathered enough to fill a small jar, and into the pot they went, followed by a skein of silk. Perhaps I\u2019m at risk of becoming jaded but I didn\u2019t take a photo of the silk just as it came out of the dye. No matter, because it dried to the deepest purple of the whole run, a properly beguiling result. Only the first season of this exercise in receiving colours has elapsed, and I wonder what will turn up during winter, let alone once spring returns! In any case I\u2019m delighted with my palette to date, which I\u2019m already stitching on paper. Meanwhile I took a friend on another foraging walk yesterday, so the exploration continues.

The net effect is easiest to express as a shift in the workflow's value: $$ \\Delta \\text{Value} = \\Delta \\text{Benefit} - N \\sum_i f_i \\cdot \\Delta p_i \\cdot L_i - \\Delta \\text{Cost of Controls} $$ where step $i$ fires $f_i$ times per run, and failures at that step cost $L_i$. The LLM changes the benefit term (richer interpretations, smoother CX), increases the failure probabilities $p_i$ (and adds failure modes that didn't exist before), and increases the cost of controls (validation layers, fallbacks, monitoring). To see why the $\\Delta p_i$ show up\u2014and why they often dominate\u2014it helps to treat a workflow as a finite-state machine. A deterministic workflow can be modeled as a Mealy machine. $$ M = (S, \\Sigma, \\Lambda, \\delta, \\lambda, s_0) $$ where $S$ captures states or progress, e.g., Awaiting Evidence , Approved , Committed , inputs $\\Sigma$ are events the system accepts, e.g., claim_received , payment_confirmed , and outputs $\\Lambda$ are the system\u2019s actions, e.g., issue_refund , send_notice. The transition function $\\delta$ determines the next state, and the output function $\\lambda$ selects the action emitted on each transition. $s_0$ is the initial state. Commit edges are transitions with irreversible real-world effects. When we introduce a large language model into a deterministic workflow, we fundamentally change the nature of the system. The FSM, which was previously predictable and verifiable at every step, now contains stochastic components. Let me illustrate the potential set of  issues with three kinds of failures: Input . Traditional workflows receive structured inputs with clear semantics, e.g., selection of claim_reason from a fixed set using a dropdown menu. With natural language inputs, the model must map text $x$ to a symbol $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma$. Consider a customer saying \"my package arrived late and damaged.\" The model must map this to the appropriate system symbols\u2014perhaps claim_damaged , claim_late , and item=A . But natural language is inherently ambiguous. Does \"late\" mean past the promised delivery date or later than the customer expected? Does \"damaged\" refer to claim_damaged (70% confidence) or claim_defective (30%)? If the LLM maps \"used\" to claim_defective instead of claim_damaged , the entire workflow routes to technical support instead of replacements. Worse, adversarial users may exploit this ambiguity. Control Flow . Deterministic routing is a crisp function $(s,\\sigma) \\mapsto s'$. Given a state and input, there's exactly one next state. When an LLM controls routing, it becomes probabilistic. From the same $(s,\\sigma)$, execution can diverge based on how the model interprets context and intent. And the model may route in a way that violates your system's assumptions. For instance, an LLM may receive a damage claim and simultaneously route it to the replacement team, quality assurance, and executive escalation because it \"sensed urgency\" in the customer's tone. It might retry failed operations repeatedly with minor variations. Output . The FSM's output function $\\lambda(s, \\sigma)$ produces a symbol from the output alphabet\u2014perhaps refund_approved or claim_denied . But the LLM must verbalize this in natural language. When verbalizing, it can introduce promises the system never made or reveal information it shouldn't. An LLM told to \"send a refund confirmation\" might compose an email promising the refund will arrive tomorrow (when processing takes 3-5 days), include a 20% discount code (unauthorized), and apologize on behalf of the CEO (inappropriate). Anti-Patterns These points lead to two common anti-patterns. First, LLM guardrails. We take guardrails to mean something that prevents bad things from happening. But LLM guardrails are probabilistic and depend on distributional assumptions. Second, schema validation. Getting output in the right format is not the same as getting the right information. Making LLMs Less Risky in an FSM The goal is not to make the LLM deterministic\u2014that is impossible\u2014but to manage its impact. Effective patterns include: Keep stochastic components off commit edges . Use two-phase commit with some verification step using HITL for expensive actions like issuing the refund. Don't use LLMs where you don't need to . For instance, LLM may invent new reasons or promises when explaining a decision. Instead, render reasons from the decision artifact (facts, rules fired) using a template: $\\lambda'(s, \\sigma) = \\text{Template}(\\text{facts}, \\text{rules})$. Blast radius constraints . Spending Limits. Add constraints like $\\phi$ (e.g., \"total refunded \u2264 total paid\") with a runtime checker. If $\\phi$ would be violated, block the transition regardless of what the agent proposes. Monitoring, Rollback, Release Measure money. Measure refund leakage, inappropriate denials, out-of-policy approvals, avoidable escalations, etc. Kill-switches and selective disablement. You need the ability to turn off specific model behaviors without shutting down the entire system. That means you can disable a tool call, remove a branch, bypass the model on certain states, or route an entire class of cases to deterministic logic or HITL. Controlled, intelligent release. LLM-driven components should never go from zero to 100%. Release changes gradually: start with low-stakes states, narrow slices of traffic, or non-financial actions. Expand only after observing the dollar impact and analyzing data. Task Granularity: The Goldilocks Problem Breaking a workflow into LLM tasks involves a fundamental tradeoff. Large tasks cause reasoning failures. Small tasks cause orchestration failures. There's an optimal middle ground\u2014but finding it is more subtle than it first appears. For total work $L$ divided into steps of size $s$, we get $n = L/s$ steps. The simplest model assumes per-step error has two components: $$ e(s) = c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_0, \\quad \\alpha > 1 $$ Where: $c \\cdot s^{\\alpha}$: complexity-driven error that grows superlinearly with task size $\\varepsilon_0$: fixed overhead error per step (parsing, tool calls, handoffs) Total error across the workflow: $$ \\text{Total Error} = \\frac{L}{s} \\cdot (c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_0) = L \\left( c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s} \\right) $$ To minimize total error, we differentiate with respect to $s$ and set to zero: $$ \\frac{d}{ds}\\left[ c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s} \\right] = c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha - 2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s^2} = 0 $$ Solving yields: $$ s_{\\text{simple}}^* = \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{c(\\alpha - 1)} \\right)^{1/\\alpha} $$ The formula suggests: Better models (lower $c$) \u2192 larger optimal steps Better tooling (lower $\\varepsilon_0$) \u2192 smaller optimal steps viable The simple model assumes overhead $\\varepsilon_0$ is fixed regardless of what's being passed between steps. But error could be multiplicative with loss in context proving damaging. A more accurate model accounts for context-dependent overhead: $$ e(s) = c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta}, \\quad 0 < \\beta < 1 $$ Where: $\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}$: truly fixed overhead (API calls, parsing) $\\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta}$: context serialization overhead that grows with complexity The choice $\\beta < 1$ reflects that context overhead grows slower than reasoning complexity\u2014passing complex context is hard, but not as hard as reasoning about it. Total error becomes: $$ \\text{Total Error} = L \\left( c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}}{s} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta - 1} \\right) $$ Taking the derivative and setting to zero: $$ c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha - 2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}}{s^2} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta - 2} = 0 $$ Multiplying by $s^2$ gives the optimality condition: $$ \\boxed{c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}} $$ Since $\\beta < 1$, the term $\\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta}$ is negative. This means at the simple model's optimum $s_{\\text{simple}}^*$, the left side is less than $\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}$. Therefore: $$ s^* > s_{\\text{simple}}^* $$ Context overhead pushes the optimal step size larger than the simple model suggests. Unlike the simple model, we must solve the optimality condition numerically and must calibrate. Other Operational Realities Models drift and change. Temperature $0$ is not a proof of determinism; vendor updates can shift behavior. Track versioned prompts and models; use canaries and rollback. Errors hide in plain sight. Long stretches of apparent success conceal catastrophic outliers. Track $\\sum_i p_i L_i$ and tail metrics (e.g., $\\text{CVaR}_\\alpha$) at the business level. Adversaries adapt. People learn \"magic phrases\" that bypass heuristics or trigger generous interpretations. Assume red\u2011teaming is continuous. The integration tax is real. Monitoring, fallbacks, rate limits, and escape hatches add complexity. Budget for it explicitly. Engineering with Uncertainty Moving to LLMs shifts the entire validation strategy. Deterministic components can be proven safe with unit tests: given the same state and input, they behave the same way every time. LLMs don\u2019t offer that. They inject variance, and variance doesn\u2019t break in predictable places. So correctness becomes a matter of risk budgeting rather than test coverage. Keep the model away from high-impact actions, let deterministic checks own the final say on anything expensive, and monitor behavior as if it were a live system rather than a piece of code. In the end, what matters is not how often the model parses JSON correctly but how much value leaks through policy violations, how much friction customers experience, and whether the workflow stays inside the tolerances the business can afford.",

The net effect is easiest to express as a shift in the workflow&apos;s value:</p><p>$$ \\Delta \\text{Value} = \\Delta \\text{Benefit} - N \\sum_i f_i \\cdot \\Delta p_i \\cdot L_i - \\Delta \\text{Cost of Controls} $$</p><p>where step $i$ fires $f_i$ times per run, and failures at that step cost $L_i$. The LLM changes the benefit term (richer interpretations, smoother CX), increases the failure probabilities $p_i$ (and adds failure modes that didn&apos;t exist before), and increases the cost of controls (validation layers, fallbacks, monitoring).</p><p>To see why the $\\Delta p_i$ show up&#x2014;and why they often dominate&#x2014;it helps to treat a workflow as a finite-state machine. A deterministic workflow can be modeled as a Mealy machine.</p><p>$$ M = (S, \\Sigma, \\Lambda, \\delta, \\lambda, s_0) $$</p><p>where $S$ captures states or progress, e.g., <em>Awaiting Evidence</em>, <em>Approved</em>, <em>Committed</em>, inputs $\\Sigma$ are events the system accepts, e.g., <em>claim_received</em>, <em>payment_confirmed</em>, and outputs $\\Lambda$ are the system&#x2019;s actions, e.g., <em>issue_refund</em>, <em>send_notice. </em>The transition function<em> </em>$\\delta$ determines the next state, and the output function $\\lambda$ selects the action emitted on each transition. $s_0$ is the initial state. Commit edges are transitions with irreversible real-world effects.</p><p>When we introduce a large language model into a deterministic workflow, we fundamentally change the nature of the system. The FSM, which was previously predictable and verifiable at every step, now contains stochastic components. Let me illustrate the potential set of  issues with three kinds of failures:</p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong>. Traditional workflows receive structured inputs with clear semantics, e.g., selection of <code>claim_reason</code> from a fixed set using a dropdown menu. With natural language inputs, the model must map text $x$ to a symbol $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma$. Consider a customer saying &quot;my package arrived late and damaged.&quot; The model must map this to the appropriate system symbols&#x2014;perhaps <code>claim_damaged</code>, <code>claim_late</code>, and <code>item=A</code>. But natural language is inherently ambiguous. Does &quot;late&quot; mean past the promised delivery date or later than the customer expected? Does &quot;damaged&quot; refer to <code>claim_damaged</code> (70% confidence) or <code>claim_defective</code> (30%)? If the LLM maps &quot;used&quot; to <code>claim_defective</code> instead of <code>claim_damaged</code>, the entire workflow routes to technical support instead of replacements. Worse, adversarial users may exploit this ambiguity.</li><li><strong>Control Flow</strong>. Deterministic routing is a crisp function $(s,\\sigma) \\mapsto s&apos;$. Given a state and input, there&apos;s exactly one next state. When an LLM controls routing, it becomes probabilistic. From the same $(s,\\sigma)$, execution can diverge based on how the model interprets context and intent. And the model may route in a way that violates your system&apos;s assumptions. For instance, an LLM may receive a damage claim and simultaneously route it to the replacement team, quality assurance, and executive escalation because it &quot;sensed urgency&quot; in the customer&apos;s tone. It might retry failed operations repeatedly with minor variations. </li><li><strong>Output</strong>. The FSM&apos;s output function $\\lambda(s, \\sigma)$ produces a symbol from the output alphabet&#x2014;perhaps <code>refund_approved</code> or <code>claim_denied</code>. But the LLM must verbalize this in natural language. When verbalizing, it can introduce promises the system never made or reveal information it shouldn&apos;t. An LLM told to &quot;send a refund confirmation&quot; might compose an email promising the refund will arrive tomorrow (when processing takes 3-5 days), include a 20% discount code (unauthorized), and apologize on behalf of the CEO (inappropriate). </li></ol><h3 id=\"anti-patterns\">Anti-Patterns</h3><p>These points lead to two common anti-patterns. First, LLM guardrails. We take guardrails to mean something that prevents bad things from happening. But LLM guardrails are probabilistic and depend on distributional assumptions. Second, schema validation. Getting output in the right format is not the same as getting the right information.</p><h3 id=\"making-llms-less-risky-in-an-fsm\">Making LLMs Less Risky in an FSM</h3><p>The goal is not to make the LLM deterministic&#x2014;that is impossible&#x2014;but to manage its impact. Effective patterns include:</p><ol><li><strong>Keep stochastic components off commit edges</strong>. Use two-phase commit with some verification step using HITL for expensive actions like issuing the refund.</li><li><strong>Don&apos;t use LLMs where you don&apos;t need to</strong>. For instance, LLM may invent new reasons or promises when explaining a decision. Instead, render reasons from the decision artifact (facts, rules fired) using a template: $\\lambda&apos;(s, \\sigma) = \\text{Template}(\\text{facts}, \\text{rules})$.</li><li><strong>Blast radius constraints</strong>. <ol><li><strong>Spending Limits. </strong>Add constraints like $\\phi$ (e.g., &quot;total refunded &#x2264; total paid&quot;) with a runtime checker. If $\\phi$ would be violated, block the transition regardless of what the agent proposes. </li><li><strong>Monitoring, Rollback, Release</strong><ol><li><strong>Measure money.</strong> Measure refund leakage, inappropriate denials, out-of-policy approvals, avoidable escalations, etc. </li><li><strong>Kill-switches and selective disablement.</strong> You need the ability to turn off <em>specific</em> model behaviors without shutting down the entire system. That means you can disable a tool call, remove a branch, bypass the model on certain states, or route an entire class of cases to deterministic logic or HITL. </li><li><strong>Controlled, intelligent release.</strong> LLM-driven components should never go from zero to 100%. Release changes gradually: start with low-stakes states, narrow slices of traffic, or non-financial actions. Expand only after observing the dollar impact and analyzing data. </li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><h3 id=\"task-granularity-the-goldilocks-problem\">Task Granularity: The Goldilocks Problem</h3><p>Breaking a workflow into LLM tasks involves a fundamental tradeoff. Large tasks cause reasoning failures. Small tasks cause orchestration failures. There&apos;s an optimal middle ground&#x2014;but finding it is more subtle than it first appears.</p><p>For total work $L$ divided into steps of size $s$, we get $n = L/s$ steps. The simplest model assumes per-step error has two components:</p><p>$$ e(s) = c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_0, \\quad \\alpha &gt; 1 $$</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li>$c \\cdot s^{\\alpha}$: complexity-driven error that grows superlinearly with task size</li><li>$\\varepsilon_0$: fixed overhead error per step (parsing, tool calls, handoffs)</li></ul><p>Total error across the workflow:</p><p>$$ \\text{Total Error} = \\frac{L}{s} \\cdot (c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_0) = L \\left( c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s} \\right) $$</p><p>To minimize total error, we differentiate with respect to $s$ and set to zero:</p><p>$$ \\frac{d}{ds}\\left[ c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s} \\right] = c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha - 2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s^2} = 0 $$</p><p>Solving yields:</p><p>$$ s_{\\text{simple}}^* = \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{c(\\alpha - 1)} \\right)^{1/\\alpha} $$</p><p>The formula suggests:</p><ul><li>Better models (lower $c$) &#x2192; larger optimal steps</li><li>Better tooling (lower $\\varepsilon_0$) &#x2192; smaller optimal steps viable</li></ul><p>The simple model assumes overhead $\\varepsilon_0$ is fixed regardless of what&apos;s being passed between steps.

My previous post helped, but I think that particular groove could be deeper. Let\u2019s revisit Gaussian Processes (GPs) and advance a step further into Bayesian Optimisation. R will be our weapon of choice, as usual. Code # Some setup code: libraries, seed, dummy function SEED <- 42 set.seed (SEED) library (tidyverse) library (cmdstanr) check_cmdstan_toolchain ( fix = TRUE , quiet = TRUE ) cost <- \\(dollars) NA OK so why Gaussian Processes? Here\u2019s the problem you face: you have some noisy data generated by an unknown (continuous, real-valued, sexy) function. You can\u2019t abide the mystery and need to map out the unobserved regions of the function. In particular, you want to find its maximum value. But it\u2019s not straightforward, because for whatever reason the mystery function is expensive to run. Code mystery_function <- function (x) { cost ( dollars = 100 ) 1.1 * sin ( sqrt (x)) } Imagine it\u2019s API charges, token consumption, or tariffs or something. The point is you can\u2019t just brute force your way through this one. You need help. Here are the observations you have so far. There\u2019s a little noise on them too, just to make life that little bit harder. Code domain <- c ( 0 , 40 ) observations <- tibble ( x = c ( 0 , 8 , 15 , 20 , 35 )) |> mutate ( y = mystery_function (x) + rnorm ( length (x), mean = 0 , sd = 0.1 ), ) ggplot (observations) + aes ( x = x, y = y) + scale_x_continuous ( limits = domain) + geom_point ( colour = \"red\" , size = 3 ) + geom_function ( fun = mystery_function, colour = \"black\" , linetype = \"dashed\" ) Figure\u00a01: Noisy observations (red points) of the mystery function (dashed line). You could just fit a line, sure. If you have a good idea about the function that\u2019s producing your data, that\u2019s the simplest and most obvious thing to do. Code ggplot (observations) + aes ( x = x, y = y) + scale_x_continuous ( limits = domain) + geom_point ( colour = \"red\" , size = 3 ) + geom_function ( fun = mystery_function, colour = \"black\" , linetype = \"dashed\" ) + geom_smooth ( method = \"lm\" , formula = y ~ sin (x ** 0.5 )) Figure\u00a02: Linear model fit (solid blue line) on the observations from the mystery function with 95% confidence interval (grey region). If we weren\u2019t masters of this toy universe however, we might not have any idea what function to fit. We could fit anything else, like a polynomial. But whatever we fit, we\u2019re making a lot of assumptions about the function and could end up quite far from the mark, especially if we don\u2019t have many observations. Code ggplot (observations) + aes ( x = x, y = y) + scale_x_continuous ( limits = domain) + geom_point ( colour = \"red\" , size = 3 ) + geom_function ( fun = mystery_function, colour = \"black\" , linetype = \"dashed\" ) + geom_smooth ( method = \"lm\" , formula = \"y ~ poly(x, 3)\" ) Figure\u00a03: Polynomial fit (solid blue line) on the observations from the mystery function with 95% confidence interval (grey region). The Bayesian aproach What we\u2019ve done so far is the non-Bayesian approach to the problem. Why bother with the Bayesian approach (Gaussian Processes) at all? First, because we don\u2019t necessarily have a good idea what our function is. It could be very nonlinear. A Gaussian Process is a non-parametric model, i.e.\u00a0it doesn\u2019t assume any specific form of the function. Second, as usual with Bayesian models, you can get a richer understanding of uncertainty that you can with linear models and confidence intervals. It\u2019s also more suited to low-data scenarios. Getting your head around the Bayesian approach can be a little challenging though. We have to forget the idea of optimising coefficients of some linear formula to fit our model. Instead we are estimating possible locations of the line. We don\u2019t care about the formula any more. Rather than a formula, we can use a Gaussian Process (GP). The GP is a distribution that generates \u201cfunctions\u201d (lines). How so? It\u2019s a multivariate normal distribution, that can generate a random value for many dimensions. If you imagine that each dimension is a point on the x-axis, a sample from the multivariate normal distribution describe a random line, or some unknown function, to look at it the other way. Code n.dims <- 16 # Sigma specifies the covariance matrix of the variables. # This identify matrix means each dim is completely unrelated. sigma <- matrix ( 0 , nrow = n.dims, ncol = n.dims) for (i in 1 : n.dims) { sigma[i, i] = 1 } random.draw <- MASS :: mvrnorm ( n = 1 , # n.samples mu = rep ( 0 , n.dims), # all centered on 0 Sigma = sigma ) ggplot ( data.frame ( x = 1 : n.dims, y = random.draw) ) + aes ( x = x, y = y) + geom_line () Figure\u00a04: Random draw from multivariate normal distribution, plotted as a line. The kernel (sigma in the code above) controls the shape of the functions generated. In the example above it\u2019s an identify matrix, but a more conventional choice would be squared exponential covariance. This generates a nice variety of functions. The two hyperparameters alpha and lambda control something like the amplitude and frequency of the generated functions. Code # Kernel sq_exp_cov <- function (x, lambda, alpha) { n <- length (x) K <- matrix ( 0 , n, n) for (i in 1 : n) { for (j in 1 : n) { diff <- sqrt ( sum ((x[i] - x[j]) ^ 2 )) K[i, j] <- alpha ^ 2 * exp ( - diff ^ 2 / ( 2 * lambda ^ 2 )) } } K } plot_random_gp <- function (lambda, alpha) { n.samples <- 5 x <- seq ( 0 , 9 , 0.1 ) samples <- MASS :: mvrnorm ( n = n.samples, mu = rep ( 0 , length (x)), Sigma = sq_exp_cov (x, lambda = lambda, alpha = alpha) ) t (samples) |> as_tibble () |> mutate ( x = x) |> pivot_longer ( - x, names_to = \"sample\" , values_to = \"y\" ) |> ggplot () + aes ( x = x, y = y, group = sample, colour = sample) + geom_line () } plot_random_gp ( lambda = 2 , alpha = 1 ) Figure\u00a05: Examples of functions sampled from a Gaussian Process with alpha = 1 and lambda = 2. So we have this mystery function generator! It can propose possible functions, and we can see how well they fit the data. We can also predict values for these functions at points that we don\u2019t have observations for. Time for Stan. As per the last blog, this Stan code was taken from an excellent course on Carpentries. I maintain that the best way to read Stan is back-to-front, so here is some invalid Stan that I\u2019ve inverted and annotated. ```{stan} model { // f_x is sampled from the GP. // Remember it's a vector of f(x), not parameters describing f. f_x ~ multi_normal(rep_vector(0, n), K); // Likelihood is evaluated on f(x) plus normally distributed noise. y_obs ~ normal(f[1 : n_obs], sigma); } parameters { // Our outputs will be f(x) for all x (our observations, x_obs, and the predictions we want, x_pred) vector[n] f_x; } data { // Observed data int n_obs; array[n_obs] real x_obs; array[n_obs] real y_obs; // Observation error - pick a value real<lower=0> sigma; // x values for which we aim to predict f(x) int n_pred; array[n_pred] real x_pred; // Hyperparameters for the kernel real alpha; real lambda; } transformed data { // We join the x observations and desired x prediction points // because we want f(x) for both observed data and new predictions int n = n_obs + n_pred; array[n] real x; x[1 : n_obs] = x_obs; x[(n_obs + 1): n] = x_pred; // We calculate the Kernel values for all observed x matrix[n, n] K; K = gp_exp_quad_cov(x, alpha, lambda); // Add \"nugget\" on diagonal for numerical stability for (i in 1 : n) { K[i, i] = K[i, i] + 1e-6; } } ``` The actual valid Stan file is here .

The Bayesian model has a much richer model of uncertainty than the linear fit. For example it\u2019s much less uncertain around the positions where we have data. Remember our original goal of finding the maximum value of the mystery function? We could narrow it down with more data. It would be most useful is if we had a way to determine the next best observation to acquire. Say we\u2019re seeking the maximum value of . If we could add one more observation at the value of our choice, what should that be? Enter the Acquisition Function This is the acquisition function , which we maximise to find the best next to acquire. There are two objectives to balance: where is improvement likely, and where is there a potentially large improvement. The most popular acquisition function is Expected Improvement, which does exactly that. For each it calculates the expected value of improvement. Since we have a Bayesian model with many posterior samples, the maths is quite easy. We just look at each point on and take the mean improvement over the best (i.e.\u00a0maximum if we\u2019re aiming to maximise ). Whichever gave the biggest mean improvement is the lucky winner and should be acquired next in the experiment. Code y.best <- max (observations $ y) expected_improvement <- function (sample, x.vals, y.best) { mat <- sample $ draws ( format = \"draws_matrix\" ) mat <- mat[, str_starts ( colnames (mat), \"f\" )] mat <- t (mat) n.points <- nrow (mat) ei <- numeric ( length = n.points) for (i in 1 : n.points) { samples <- mat[i, ] improvements <- pmax ( 0 , samples - y.best) ei[i] <- mean (improvements) } x.vals[ which.max (ei)] } x.next <- expected_improvement (sample, x.vals, y.best) sprintf ( \"Next x: %.2f\" , x.next) [1] \"Next x: 5.00\" Et voila, the model says we should measure at x=5. The maximum of the mystery function when solved analytically is in fact about 2.47, so this is intuitively a step in the right direction. Not bad, acquisition function! Bayesian Optimisation What if we do measure again, what then? We could rinse and repeat, until we converge on a maximum. In essence, that\u2019s all there is to Bayesian Optimisation: fit the model, calculate your next acquisition with the expected improvement function, and fit again. Of course the R community giveth; you can use tune_bayes rather than rolling your own optimiser. So, there we have it. We fitted a Gaussian Process model on noisy observations from a mystery function, and used the expected improvement acquisition function to determine the next observation we should obtain if we want to find the function maximum, which is the first step in Bayesian Optimisation.

Why bother with the Bayesian approach (Gaussian Processes) at all?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>First, because we don\u2019t necessarily have a good idea what our function is. It could be very nonlinear. A Gaussian Process is a non-parametric model, i.e.&nbsp;it doesn\u2019t assume any specific form of the function.</p></li>\n<li><p>Second, as usual with Bayesian models, you can get a richer understanding of uncertainty that you can with linear models and confidence intervals. It\u2019s also more suited to low-data scenarios.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Getting your head around the Bayesian approach can be a little challenging though. We have to forget the idea of optimising coefficients of some linear formula to fit our model. Instead we are estimating possible locations of the line. We don\u2019t care about the formula any more.</p>\n<p>Rather than a formula, we can use a Gaussian Process (GP). The GP is a distribution that generates \u201cfunctions\u201d (lines). How so? It\u2019s a multivariate normal distribution, that can generate a random value for many dimensions.</p>\n<p>If you imagine that each dimension is a point on the x-axis, a sample from the multivariate normal distribution describe a random line, or some unknown function, to look at it the other way.</p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<details class=\"code-fold\" open=\"\">\nCode\n<div class=\"code-copy-outer-scaffold\"><div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb6\" style=\"background: #f1f3f5;\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb6-1\">n.dims <span class=\"ot\" style=\"color: #003B4F;

        "full_content": "Time series forecasting is often considered the \u201cdark art\u201d of data science. Unlike standard regression problems where we assume observations are independent, time series data is riddled with autocorrelation, seasonality, and trends. Whether you are predicting stock prices using R or forecasting sales for a retail giant, the algorithms may change (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM), but the fundamental principles remain the same. Here are the 10 Golden Rules every data scientist should follow when dealing with temporal data. 1. Visual Inspection is Non-Negotiable Before you write a single line of modeling code, plot your data . Summary statistics can lie, but a plot rarely does. Look for: Trend: Is the data moving up or down? Seasonality: Is there a repeating pattern? Outliers: Are there spikes that shouldn\u2019t be there? Gaps: Is there missing data? 2. Never Shuffle Your Data In standard machine learning, we shuffle data to create train/test splits. In time series, this is a cardinal sin. Time is strictly linear. You cannot use data from next week to predict today. Always use a temporal split : Train: Jan 2020 - Dec 2023 Test: Jan 2024 - Mar 2024 3. Establish a Baseline (The Naive Model) How do you know if your complex LSTM model is actually \u201cgood\u201d? You need a benchmark.\nAlways compare your model against a Naive Method : Naive 1: Tomorrow\u2019s value will be the same as today\u2019s. Naive 2 (Seasonal): Next June\u2019s sales will be the same as last June\u2019s.\nIf your complex model cannot beat these simple heuristics, it is not worth deploying. 4. Respect Stationarity Most classical statistical models (like ARIMA) assume the statistical properties of the series (mean, variance) do not change over time. If your data has a trend, difference it. If the variance is growing (heteroscedasticity), apply a log transformation . 5. Domain Knowledge > Algorithms An algorithm doesn\u2019t know that a spike in sales was due to \u201cBlack Friday\u201d or that a drop in traffic was due to a server outage. Feature Engineering: Incorporate holidays, weather data, or marketing events as external regressors. Context is often more powerful than hyperparameter tuning. 6. Watch Out for Leakage Data leakage in time series is subtle. If you use future information to predict the past , your model will look amazing in training but fail in production. Example: Using the \u201caverage monthly temperature\u201d of 2024 to predict daily sales in Jan 2024. You wouldn\u2019t know the monthly average until the month is over! 7. Diagnostics Matter (Check Your Residuals) A good model extracts all the \u201csignal\u201d and leaves behind only \u201cnoise\u201d.\nCheck the residuals (errors) of your model. They should look like White Noise : Mean of zero. Constant variance. No autocorrelation (Check the ACF plot of residuals).\nIf there is a pattern in your errors, your model missed something. 8. Embrace Uncertainty Point forecasts (e.g., \u201cSales will be 105 units\u201d) are almost always wrong.\nInstead, provide Prediction Intervals (e.g., \u201cSales will be between 95 and 115 units with 95% confidence\u201d). This is crucial for decision-makers to assess risk. 9. Choose the Right Metric Don\u2019t just rely on $R^2$. Choose a metric that fits your business case: RMSE: Penalizes large errors heavily (good for safety-critical forecasts). MAE: Easier to interpret (average error). MAPE: Good for percentages, but fails if actual values are zero. 10. Complexity $\\neq$ Accuracy There is a temptation to use the latest Transformer or Deep Learning model for every problem. However, for many real-world univariate time series, simple models like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA often outperform complex neural networks. Start simple, and only add complexity if the baseline fails. Conclusion Forecasting is as much about understanding the data generation process as it is about the math. By following these rules, you ensure that your models are not just fitting the noise, but actually capturing the signal. Happy Forecasting!",

Never Shuffle Your Data</h2>\n<p>In standard machine learning, we shuffle data to create train/test splits. <strong>In time series, this is a cardinal sin.</strong>\nTime is strictly linear. You cannot use data from next week to predict today. Always use a <strong>temporal split</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Train:</em> Jan 2020 - Dec 2023</li>\n  <li><em>Test:</em> Jan 2024 - Mar 2024</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-establish-a-baseline-the-naive-model\">3. Establish a Baseline (The Naive Model)</h2>\n<p>How do you know if your complex LSTM model is actually \u201cgood\u201d? You need a benchmark.\nAlways compare your model against a <strong>Naive Method</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Naive 1:</strong> Tomorrow\u2019s value will be the same as today\u2019s.</li>\n  <li><strong>Naive 2 (Seasonal):</strong> Next June\u2019s sales will be the same as last June\u2019s.\nIf your complex model cannot beat these simple heuristics, it is not worth deploying.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"4-respect-stationarity\">4. Respect Stationarity</h2>\n<p>Most classical statistical models (like ARIMA) assume the statistical properties of the series (mean, variance) do not change over time.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If your data has a trend, <strong>difference</strong> it.</li>\n  <li>If the variance is growing (heteroscedasticity), apply a <strong>log transformation</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"5-domain-knowledge--algorithms\">5. Domain Knowledge &gt; Algorithms</h2>\n<p>An algorithm doesn\u2019t know that a spike in sales was due to \u201cBlack Friday\u201d or that a drop in traffic was due to a server outage.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Incorporate holidays, weather data, or marketing events as external regressors.</li>\n  <li>Context is often more powerful than hyperparameter tuning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"6-watch-out-for-leakage\">6. Watch Out for Leakage</h2>\n<p>Data leakage in time series is subtle. If you use <em>future</em> information to predict the <em>past</em>, your model will look amazing in training but fail in production.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Example:</em> Using the \u201caverage monthly temperature\u201d of 2024 to predict daily sales in Jan 2024. You wouldn\u2019t know the monthly average until the month is over!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"7-diagnostics-matter-check-your-residuals\">7. Diagnostics Matter (Check Your Residuals)</h2>\n<p>A good model extracts all the \u201csignal\u201d and leaves behind only \u201cnoise\u201d.\nCheck the residuals (errors) of your model. They should look like <strong>White Noise</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Mean of zero.</li>\n  <li>Constant variance.</li>\n  <li><strong>No autocorrelation</strong> (Check the ACF plot of residuals).\nIf there is a pattern in your errors, your model missed something.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"8-embrace-uncertainty\">8. Embrace Uncertainty</h2>\n<p>Point forecasts (e.g., \u201cSales will be 105 units\u201d) are almost always wrong.\nInstead, provide <strong>Prediction Intervals</strong> (e.g., \u201cSales will be between 95 and 115 units with 95% confidence\u201d). This is crucial for decision-makers to assess risk.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"9-choose-the-right-metric\">9. Choose the Right Metric</h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t just rely on $R^2$. Choose a metric that fits your business case:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>RMSE:</strong> Penalizes large errors heavily (good for safety-critical forecasts).</li>\n  <li><strong>MAE:</strong> Easier to interpret (average error).</li>\n  <li><strong>MAPE:</strong> Good for percentages, but fails if actual values are zero.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"10-complexity-neq-accuracy\">10. Complexity $\\neq$ Accuracy</h2>\n<p>There is a temptation to use the latest Transformer or Deep Learning model for every problem. However, for many real-world univariate time series, simple models like <strong>Exponential Smoothing (ETS)</strong> or <strong>ARIMA</strong> often outperform complex neural networks. Start simple, and only add complexity if the baseline fails.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Forecasting is as much about understanding the data generation process as it is about the math. By following these rules, you ensure that your models are not just fitting the noise, but actually capturing the signal.</p>\n\n<p><em>Happy Forecasting!</em></p>"

Virgil joined the scikit-learn team as a Contributor Experience Team member in December 2024. GitHub: @virchan LinkedIn: @virgil-chan Website: https://virchan.github.io Tell us about yourself. My name is Virgil, and I\u2019m currently working as a Forward Deployed Engineer \u2013 Pre-Sales at Union.ai. Based in San Jose, California, I previously worked as a consultant, using libraries from the scientific Python ecosystem on data science and machine-learning projects, including medical data analysis, traffic-network prediction, and model evaluation. Before deciding that computers are more fun, I was doing mathematical research in topology. How did you first get involved in open source? I first got involved in open source during the COVID-19 lockdown. I used that time to study Python programming, data science, analytics, and machine learning, and that\u2019s when I discovered libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, NetworkX, and TensorFlow. Once I became more confident in my skills, I started working as a consultant and used these libraries to deliver data-driven solutions for clients. We would love to learn of your open source journey. I was transitioning from academia into software development, and I quickly learnt that companies valued hands-on experience more than an advanced degree. At the same time, the rise of GPU-driven workloads and LLM-based solutions made my earlier consulting projects look less impressive on paper. I ended up stuck in the infinite loop of no-job-no-experience. Even though I came from a non-traditional background, and my resume didn\u2019t match what recruiters and ATS systems usually look for, I\u2019ve always believed that my experience is something I can build myself. Since companies weren\u2019t keen on training junior developers, open source became one of the not-so-many viable paths. I started looking for a project where I could grow, be useful, and apply my academic training in a meaningful way. That search naturally led me to scikit-learn. How did you get involved in scikit-learn? My first PR to scikit-learn ( scikit-learn/scikit-learn#27913 ) was a classic \u201cgood first issue\u201d: adding the URL of a scikit-learn example to the relevant places in the documentation. I opened it in December 2023 and it was merged into the main branch in March 2024. Maren helped me navigate the codebase and understand the CI workflow, which gave me a solid foundation for later contributions. Even though I\u2019m now more experienced with the contributing workflow, I still revisit that PR from time to time to remind myself of the challenges first-time contributors face, and how I can support them. My next PR ( scikit-learn/scikit-learn#29709 ) was more technical, fixing a bug in the (root) mean squared log error function. The expected behaviour was to check that inputs were in the domain of $\\log(1 + x)$, but the implementation at the time checked the domain of $\\log(x)$ instead. It was one of the few issues I fully understood and knew how to solve, so I volunteered to create a PR. Adrin reviewed it and mentored me throughout the process. Once everything looked good and the CI passed, he asked me to add array API support to the function. And that\u2019s where the fun began. I had no idea what the array API was, but I already had the habit of reading discussions and merged PRs in my spare time. With a bit of Googling, I quickly understood what needed to be done and the broader importance of the array API project. In fact, completing the array API project has become one of my mid-term goals for my scikit-learn work. Under the guidance of Adrin, Guillaume, Olivier, and Omar, my PRs improved, and contributing became even more rewarding because of how supportive the maintainers were. I also started reviewing PRs, especially from first-time contributors working on the same \u201cgood first issue\u201d I began with. In December 2024, I joined the scikit-learn team. I\u2019m honoured that the team welcomed me and trusted me with more responsibility, such as representing scikit-learn at the Scientific Python Developer Summit in May 2025 , implementing temperature scaling as a new feature (with Christian) , and having the ability to run CUDA CI myself. It feels good to pass the same positivity I received back into the community. To which OSS projects and communities do you contribute? I\u2019m also interested in scaling machine-learning algorithms, so I\u2019ve been exploring CUDA and cuML as well. What is alluring about OSS? Open source fosters a collaborative environment where everyone wins: end-users, maintainers, and contributors. Because it is volunteer-driven, it becomes easier to recognise that the problem itself is the problem, the bug or the issue, rather than the people involved. As a result, the usual institutional complications, such as power or ego struggles, conflicts of interest over funding, or pressure from deadlines, are far less likely to drag the project down. People have more freedom to focus on solving problems, which creates an ideal environment for exploration, experimentation, collaboration, learning, and growth. Open source has given me the chance to grow, develop new skills, and broaden my perspective, something I\u2019ve been battling since finishing college. By trading my time for responsibility, I\u2019ve found open source to be a meaningful and genuinely rewarding experience. What are your favorite resources, books, courses, conferences, etc? I found the interview between scikit-learn and Code for Thought on YouTube. The maintainers shared their open-source journeys from how they got started to how they became involved in scikit-learn, which I found inspiring and motivating. For example, I can\u2019t agree more with Gael\u2019s point that \u201copen source should be spontaneous\u201d and that \u201ca diversity of opinion will make better software.\u201d I also learned from Adrin that I could get more involved in the project by becoming the second reviewer for a PR, which gave me the confidence to start reviewing PRs. I think this interview can help people understand the project from a more human and non-technical perspective. What are your hobbies, outside of work and open source? If I\u2019m done with work and house chores, I usually listen to music. I enjoy classical music (Mozart, Brahms, Rachmaninoff, etc.), and I\u2019m currently getting more exposure to Chopin\u2019s work. I also like Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll (Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Deep Purple, etc.), and I find that AC/DC can \u201cpush me to eleven\u201d whenever I\u2019m stuck at work. I also enjoy reading novels. At the moment I\u2019m reading The Silmarillion by Tolkien, and my to-read list keeps growing. I like hanging out with cats as well. I volunteer with an animal rescue group in San Jose, where I help care for the cats in their sanctuary and assist at adoption fairs.",

I started looking for a project where I could grow, be useful, and apply my academic training in a meaningful way. That search naturally led me to scikit-learn.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>How did you get involved in scikit-learn?</strong></p>\n\n    <p>My first PR to scikit-learn (<a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27913\">scikit-learn/scikit-learn#27913</a>) was a classic \u201cgood first issue\u201d: adding the URL of a scikit-learn example to the relevant places in the documentation. I opened it in December 2023 and it was merged into the main branch in March 2024. Maren helped me navigate the codebase and understand the CI workflow, which gave me a solid foundation for later contributions. Even though I\u2019m now more experienced with the contributing workflow, I still revisit that PR from time to time to remind myself of the challenges first-time contributors face, and how I can support them.</p>\n\n    <p>My next PR (<a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29709\">scikit-learn/scikit-learn#29709</a>) was more technical, fixing a bug in the (root) mean squared log error function. The expected behaviour was to check that inputs were in the domain of $\\log(1 + x)$, but the implementation at the time checked the domain of $\\log(x)$ instead. It was one of the few issues I fully understood and knew how to solve, so I volunteered to create a PR. Adrin reviewed it and mentored me throughout the process. Once everything looked good and the CI passed, he asked me to add array API support to the function. And that\u2019s where the fun began.</p>\n\n    <p>I had no idea what the array API was, but I already had the habit of reading discussions and merged PRs in my spare time. With a bit of Googling, I quickly understood what needed to be done and the broader importance of the array API project. In fact, completing the array API project has become one of my mid-term goals for my scikit-learn work. Under the guidance of Adrin, Guillaume, Olivier, and Omar, my PRs improved, and contributing became even more rewarding because of how supportive the maintainers were. I also started reviewing PRs, especially from first-time contributors working on the same \u201cgood first issue\u201d I began with. In December 2024, I joined the scikit-learn team.</p>\n\n    <p>I\u2019m honoured that the team welcomed me and trusted me with more responsibility, such as representing scikit-learn at the <a href=\"https://scientific-python.org/summits/developer/2025/\">Scientific Python Developer Summit in May 2025</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31068\">implementing temperature scaling as a new feature (with Christian)</a>, and having the ability to run <a href=\"https://betatim.github.io/posts/github-action-with-gpu/\">CUDA CI</a> myself. It feels good to pass the same positivity I received back into the community.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>To which OSS projects and communities do you contribute?</strong></p>\n\n    <p>I\u2019m also interested in scaling machine-learning algorithms, so I\u2019ve been exploring CUDA and cuML as well.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>What is alluring about OSS?</strong></p>\n\n    <p>Open source fosters a collaborative environment where everyone wins: end-users, maintainers, and contributors. Because it is volunteer-driven, it becomes easier to recognise that the problem itself is the problem, the bug or the issue, rather than the people involved. As a result, the usual institutional complications, such as power or ego struggles, conflicts of interest over funding, or pressure from deadlines, are far less likely to drag the project down. People have more freedom to focus on solving problems, which creates an ideal environment for exploration, experimentation, collaboration, learning, and growth.</p>\n\n    <p>Open source has given me the chance to grow, develop new skills, and broaden my perspective, something I\u2019ve been battling since finishing college. By trading my time for responsibility, I\u2019ve found open source to be a meaningful and genuinely rewarding experience.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>What are your favorite resources, books, courses, conferences, etc?</strong></p>\n\n    <p>I found the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMbWkAosBVA\">interview between scikit-learn and Code for Thought</a> on YouTube. The maintainers shared their open-source journeys from how they got started to how they became involved in scikit-learn, which I found inspiring and motivating. For example, I can\u2019t agree more with Gael\u2019s point that \u201copen source should be spontaneous\u201d and that \u201ca diversity of opinion will make better software.\u201d I also learned from Adrin that I could get more involved in the project by becoming the second reviewer for a PR, which gave me the confidence to start reviewing PRs. I think this interview can help people understand the project from a more human and non-technical perspective.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>What are your hobbies, outside of work and open source?</strong></p>\n\n    <p>If I\u2019m done with work and house chores, I usually listen to music. I enjoy classical music (Mozart, Brahms, Rachmaninoff, etc.), and I\u2019m currently getting more exposure to Chopin\u2019s work. I also like Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll (Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Deep Purple, etc.), and I find that AC/DC can \u201cpush me to eleven\u201d whenever I\u2019m stuck at work.</p>\n\n    <p>I also enjoy reading novels. At the moment I\u2019m reading The Silmarillion by Tolkien, and my to-read list keeps growing.</p>\n\n    <p>I like hanging out with cats as well. I volunteer with an animal rescue group in San Jose, where I help care for the cats in their sanctuary and assist at adoption fairs.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>"

        "full_content": "A few of the rituals of modern Islam are traceable to pagan roots, here are some practised before and after the emergence of Muhammad: The tawaf ritual was performed both during the pilgrimage to a shrine (Hajj) or in home worship. In the home, the household would set up a baetyl and circumambulate it seven times whilst uttering the talbiyah invocation: seven being a mystical number to the pagan Arabs as it was significant of the seven planets. Reportedly, the pagan Arabs would perform the tawaf naked as they refused to approach their gods in the clothes they had sinned in although from an Islamic point of view, this practice was seen as blasphemous and disrespectful and as a prime example of pre-Islamic ignorance or jahiliyyah . The Hajj is a pilgrimage to the Ka'aba in Mecca, the holiest site in the Islamic world . This ritual however is truly pre-Islamic, when tribes all across the Arabian peninsula would forget their tribal feuding and converge upon the city for worship and trade. This practice originated amongst the pagan Arabs but was not exclusive to them, as Christian and Jewish tribes would also join the pagans in festivities, trading of goods and worship. The pagans of Mecca even included images of Mary, Jesus and Abraham in the Ka'aba to attract the attention of the other faiths, displaying that Christianity and Judaism in pre-Islamic Arabia often enjoyed a syncretic relationship with the native polytheistic animism of the region. It is noted too, that the pagan Arabs would shave their heads whilst on the hajj to the various shrines near Mecca and Yathrib. Janazah is the Arabic term for burial practices, or 'funeral'. In pre-Islamic Arabia, rites associated with mourning were called al-Niyaha ('the Lamentations') which\u00a0Arab women performed by shaving their heads, scratching their faces and tearing their clothes whilst wailing and shrieking loudly; the latter being said to drive away evil spirits from the corpse of the deceased. An Arab man who was a member of the deceased's family would perform niyaha by wearing sackcloth or some other coarse material and spreading sand on their heads: what this symbolized is unclear but it important to note that this ritual is indentical to that of the Hebrews and also the people of Ugarit. Grave goods were often buried with the deceased and in the case of pagan sheikhs, a camel would be tethered at the grave and left to starve so that it would accompany the sheikh to the afterlife ( akhirah ). Poets often expressed that they wished for the graves of their loved ones to be \"refreshed with abundant rain\". In pre-Islamic Arabian religion, the talbiyah was a prayer: a chant that was loudly acclaimed by worshipers as they completed a processional circuit around an idol, temple or sacred stone which was the abode of a divinity during a pilgrimage. The purpose of the talbiyah was to show gratitude to the deity or deities for assisting and supporting their devotees; in addition to placing emphasis on the benevolence and power of the deity.The main talbiyah in the pre-Islamic period differed from its incarnation post-Muhammad in that it proclaimed that there were other gods besides Allah although it asserted the fact that Allah was supreme even among the polytheists. ''Labbayka All \u0101 humma! Labbayka! Labbayka l \u0101 sharika laka, illa sharikun huwa laka, Tamlikuhu wa-m \u0101 malaka.'' This pre-Islamic talbiyah translates as: ''At thy service O Deity! At thy service! At thy service! Thou hast no associate save the one who is thine, Thou hast dominion over him and over what he possesseth.'' The point of this was to proclaim Allah's glory even over the other pagan gods who were powerless to intercede on behalf of the worshiper without the high god Allah's sanction. The word ' All \u0101 humma' was used as an invocation to any divine being during the pre-Islamic hajj and was not specific to All \u0101h alone. There was also another talbiyah of the Quraysh in specific veneration of the warrior god Hubal which goes as: \"Labbayka All \u0101 huma! Labbayka, innana laqah. Haramtana 'ala assinati ar -rimah. Yahsuduna an-nasu 'ala an-najah.\" Translated into English, this talbiyah reads as \"At thy service O Deity! At thy service, we are immune. Thou hast protected us from the edges of the lances. People envy us for our success.\" The talbiyah ritual was carried through into Islam as part of the Muslim hajj , although any references to polytheism were removed. The god Allah was considered to be the benevolent creator by the pagan Arabs and was believed to be remote, distant and inaccessible to the everyday man and woman; so other deities were called upon to intercede for Him or bring the worshiper closer to Him. The concept of shaf \u0101 'a , that is, gods and goddesses interceding on\u00a0behalf of Allah,\u00a0is reflected especially in the myriad talbiyah that were chanted by the Quraysh and other Arab tribes as they circumambulated the Ka'aba, going as: 'Wa'l-L \u0101 t-a wa'l Uzz \u0101 , wa Man\u0101t-a al-thalith\u0101ta al-'ukhr \u0101 , Tilk al-ghar\u0101niq al-'ul\u0101, wa inna shaf \u0101' ata-hunna la-turtaj \u0101 .' In English: 'By al-L \u0101 t and al-'Uzz \u0101 , and Man \u0101 t, the third goddess, the other; Verily they are the most exalted cranes, and their intercession is to be hoped for.'' The talbiyah of the tribe of Banu Thaqif who lived in Ta'if, not far from Mecca, proclaimed Allah to be be superior to their tribal goddesses al-L \u0101 t and al-'Uzz \u0101 ; the verse going as: ' Uzz \u0101humu wa'l-L \u0101tu fi yadayka, D \u0101nat laka al-asn \u0101 mu ta'ziman ilayka, Qad adh'anat bi silmih \u0101 ilayka .' Translated as: ' Al-'Uzz \u0101 and al-L \u0101t are in thy hands, All \u0101h; the idols submit to thee by glorifying thee; they approach thee submissively in devotion .' The talibiyah of the worshipers of Jih \u0101r, the chief god of the tribe of Hawazin and the patron deity of the 'Ukaz fair, went as: ' Labbayka j'al dhunuban \u0101 jub \u0101r, wa-hdin \u0101 li-awdahi al-man \u0101r, wa-matti'n \u0101 wa-mallin \u0101 bi-Jih \u0101r .' This translates as: ' At thy service, let our\u00a0trespasses\u00a0be unpunished; lead us towards the clearest signpost; let us enjoy life\u00a0for a long time and let us live long through Jih \u0101r .' The Ifada was a ritual feast celebrated in honor of the weather god Quzah by the tribes of Mecca and was performed by facing his sanctuary at Muzdalifah during the rites of tahannuth . This festival was usually celebrated after the autumnal equinox. In pagan Arabia, the sa'ibah was\u00a0an animal dedicated to a god that was left to pasture without attention. The mother of the bahirah (she-camel), after ten successful births the sa'ibah was not ridden or milked and was allowed to wander where she wished - becoming the sole property of the god whose shrine she wandered near. Muhammad ibn Abd-'Allah, prophet of Islam, vehemently condemned and outlawed the practice of sa'ibah , wasilah , bahirah and hamiyah . Qurban (\"Nearness\", \"Sacrifice\")\u00a0was performed by sacrificing the first of the flock or the first of the harvest. Essentially it is thanking the god by offering it the first cut of what the family gained thus placating the god and gaining its blessing. This was a ritual shared by the Hebrew tribes of Palestine, who called it korban ;\u00a0with both the\u00a0Arabic and Hebrew words meaning \"nearness\", a reference to the nearness felt by the worshiper towards the divinity. The pagan Arabians would offer qurban to a deity in a very simplistic manner, addressing their gods and invoking them with a short prayer and then by spilling the blood of the animal on the altar, allotting portions of the sacrificed animals meat among the tribe. The god would be satisfied with the blood alone. Sacrificial offerings to the gods in pre-Islamic Arabia were not always of blood: the Arabs would often offer libations of milk, oil or wine; the first of the harvest ( far \u0101 'i ); incense; and expensive ornaments, to please the deity. The altars of the pagan Najdi and Hijazi nomads were usually made of solid rock or built out of unhewn stone - the harshness of the desert steppe and the practical mindset of the Bedouin preventing the construction of more extravagant stone temples like those in Tayma and the kingdoms of the Yemen. This humble form of sacrifice was also the earliest among the Semitic peoples, originating with nomadic Hebrew and Arab tribes and continuing through with the Bedouin until the spread of Islam in the 6th century AD. In the sacred open air enclosure ( haram ) where sacrifices were offered, only the ritually clean and unarmed could enter to worship the baetyl or statue of the god installed there with worship being accompanied by music; clapping; dancing; whistling and prostrating before the enshrined god or goddess. On a related matter, the practice of qurban was also shared by the cousins of the Arabs: the Midianites, Hebrews and Edomites to the north-west of the Arabian peninsula who would offer a sacrifice of an animal (or very rarely a human) at the infamous High Places attested to in the Hebrew Bible. The sedentary peoples of Yemen, Mecca and the north Arabian oases practised qurban too, but on a more complicated scale with established temples and a priesthood ( kuhaniyyah ), though the original spiritual concepts of supplication and placation were still maintained. Barakah in pre-Islamic Arabian thought is a term used to denote a blessing or a benevolent force that is generated from a god or goddess, which could be gained by various means including invocations; sacrifice; talismans; offerings of gifts to the deity, and by completing rituals such as the hajj pilgrimage.The Arabian barakah is equal in concept to the Hebrew berakhah and denoted any sanctifying power.\u00a0In Islamic belief, however, Allah is the only source of barakah . Tahannuth is the pre-Islamic Arabian term used to denote devotional religious practices that were performed by the pagan Quraysh either during the hajj pilgrimage or on the month of Ramadan. The rites included various acts of charity such as feeding the poor and freeing slaves, in addition to mystical rites ( manasik ): the main of which involved undertaking a sojourn ( 'ukuf ) to the shrines ( masajid ) and high places\u00a0in the mountains of Mecca, where for one night they would dwell, and offer prayers ( du'a ), fast, and\u00a0meditate in the presence of gods and spirits. The tahannuth concluded with the devotees returning back to Mecca from their retreat at the shrines and circumambulating the Ka'aba seven times in a week, in veneration of the seven planets of antiquity. The various retreats where the pagan Arabs would perform their rites included shrines located at Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah.",

The mother of the <i>bahirah</i> (she-camel), after ten successful births the <i>sa'ibah </i>was not ridden or milked and was allowed to wander where she wished - becoming the sole property of the god whose shrine she wandered near. Muhammad ibn Abd-'Allah, prophet of Islam, vehemently condemned and outlawed the practice of <i>sa'ibah</i>,<i> wasilah</i>,<i> bahirah</i> and <i>hamiyah</i>.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span><br /></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span><b>Qurban </b>(\"Nearness\", \"Sacrifice\")&nbsp;was performed by sacrificing the first of the flock or the first of the harvest. Essentially it is thanking the god by offering it the first cut of what the family gained thus placating the god and gaining its blessing. This was a ritual shared by the Hebrew tribes of Palestine, who called it <i>korban</i>;&nbsp;with both the&nbsp;Arabic and Hebrew words meaning \"nearness\", a reference to the nearness felt by the worshiper towards the divinity.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span><br /></span>\n<span>The pagan Arabians would offer </span><i style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">qurban&nbsp;</i><span>to a deity in a very simplistic manner, addressing their gods and invoking them with a short prayer and then by spilling the blood of the animal on the altar, allotting portions of the sacrificed animals meat among the tribe. The god would be satisfied with the blood alone. Sacrificial offerings to the gods in pre-Islamic Arabia were not always of blood: the Arabs would often offer libations of milk, oil or wine; the first of the harvest (<i>far</i><i style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>\u0101</span></i><i>'i</i>); incense; and expensive ornaments, to please the deity.</span><br />\n<span><br /></span><span>The altars of the pagan Najdi and Hijazi nomads were usually made of solid rock or built out of unhewn stone - the harshness of the desert steppe and the practical mindset of the Bedouin preventing the construction of more extravagant stone temples like those in Tayma and the kingdoms of the Yemen. This humble form of sacrifice was also the earliest among the Semitic peoples, originating with nomadic Hebrew and Arab tribes and&nbsp;</span><span>continuing through with the Bedouin until the spread of Islam in the 6th century AD. In the sacred open air enclosure (</span><i style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">haram</i><span>) where sacrifices were offered, only the ritually clean and unarmed could enter to worship the baetyl or statue of the god installed there with worship being accompanied by music; clapping; dancing; whistling and prostrating before the enshrined god or goddess.</span><br />\n<span><br /></span><span>On a related matter, the practice of qurban was also shared by the cousins of the Arabs: the Midianites, Hebrews and Edomites to the north-west of the Arabian peninsula who would offer a sacrifice of an animal (or very rarely a human) at the infamous High Places attested to in the Hebrew Bible. The sedentary peoples of Yemen, Mecca and the north Arabian oases practised qurban too, but on a more complicated scale with established temples and a priesthood (<i>kuhaniyyah</i>), though the original spiritual concepts of supplication and placation were still maintained.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span><br /></span>\n<b style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Barakah</b><span>&nbsp;in pre-Islamic Arabian thought is a term used to denote a blessing or a benevolent force that is generated from a god or goddess, which could be gained by various means including invocations; sacrifice; talismans; offerings of gifts to the deity, and by completing rituals such as the <i>hajj </i>pilgrimage.The Arabian&nbsp;<i>barakah </i>is equal in concept to the Hebrew <i>berakhah </i>and denoted any sanctifying power.&nbsp;In Islamic belief, however, Allah is the only source of <i>barakah</i>.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span><br /></span>\n\n<span><b>Tahannuth </b>is the pre-Islamic Arabian term used to denote devotional religious practices that were performed by the pagan Quraysh either during the <i>hajj </i>pilgrimage or on the month of Ramadan.

Version 1 is available at https://doi.org/10.53731/8gwcz-gv749 . Use cases Classification of scholarly works into defined subject areas is important for two groups of use cases: Understanding . Fathom the kind of research topics that are covered in science blogs. Discovery . Find similar publications to the one you just read via Rogue Scholar. A good example of the first use case is a study recently published by Catharina Ochser and colleagues about scholarly blogs in Germany, and one of the main outcomes was the disciplinary distribution of these blogs: Fig. 1 Overlap of disciplines. The majority of the blogs they found were in the humanities and social sciences. One important reason for this is de.hypotheses , the German-language version of the large blog portal Hypotheses, offering hosting and other services to humanities and social sciences blogs. Five years ago in the Make Data Count project , we were interested in the subject classification of research data, as usage of datasets is highly dependent on community size and community standards. One big problem was that the standardized subject classification of datasets was mostly lacking, so we started making this easier for DataCite members: push for the OECD Fields of Science as the standard subject area vocabulary that can be mapped from other vocabularies, and show the OECD Fields of Science as a facet in the search results of DataCite Search. The second use case is primarily driven by readers. After reading an interesting science blog post, they might want to read more posts with similar content. Or they have an idea about the content they are looking for, but it is poorly described using keywords. Blogging platforms have long provided this functionality, but have been limited to a single blog and have used old technology, rather than semantic search . Limitations Rogue Scholar launched OECD Fields of Science subject area support for every blog post in February of this year. While this was a good start, there were three significant shortcomings: Subject area classification was at the blog level, not for individual posts, With 48 subject areas, the OECD Fields of Science are too broad for some important use cases, Crossref metadata don't support subject area metadata. When submitting a blog to be archived by Rogue Scholar, one of only a few questions I ask blog authors is for the subject area of their blog using the OECD Fields of Science list. Similar to the subject classification of journals rather than journal articles (which, unfortunately is more often done), this approach has limitations, in particular for multidisciplinary blogs/journals. One prominent example in Rogue Scholar is the SVPOW blog, which has been writing about sauropods since October 2007, but also frequently publishes about Open Access . The six top-level and 42 second-level subject areas in the OECD Fields of Science are good enough for many high-level questions, such as R&D spending or doctoral students per country and/or over time. But for more fine-grained questions, more granularity in the subject classification is needed. There are for example almost 20,000 social science and almost 5,000 computer and information science blog posts in Rogue Scholar, which give a very broad picture. Using a more granular subject area classification applied to each publication is a major challenge, as can for example be seen in the major curation effort needed to classify the biomedical literature into Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) at PubMed. The third major limitation is that publishers can't easily distribute subject classification information, as Crossref metadata can't hold that information. DataCite is better in this regard, but unfortunately subject area metadata is still only included in a small fraction of DataCite DOIs. Ideas For Rogue Scholar, I always envisioned a semi-automated approach based on machine learning and human curation of edge cases. Having the full-text of all blog posts available in machine-readable form makes this possible, but picking the right subject area classification and building a classification workflow from scratch are still major challenges. The ideal subject area classification is more granular than OECD, covers all scholarly disciplines, is widely used (and documented), and openly available. My main candidate five years ago, when I did the subject area work for DataCite, was the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC) Fields of Research with more than 1000 subject areas, and used for example by the repository Figshare. The German Research Foundation (DFG) Subject Areas used by the Registry of Research Data Repositories ( re3data ), on the other hand, have some limitations, primarily that they were developed for a different use case - panels for grant evaluation. The CWTS/OpenAlex classification announced in January 2024 with about 4500 topics categorized into subfields and fields that map to the All Science Journal Classification ( ASJC ) is a very attractive alternative, especially since OpenAlex uses it, makes an open API available, and more importantly makes the pre-trained model available for download with an Apache 2.0 open source license. This makes it straightforward to run the classifier on Rogue Scholar infrastructure and not depend on external APIs with associated costs and rate-limits. flickr photo by Eva Amsen Like many interesting collaborations, a conversation with Nees Jan van Eck from CWTS at a Dagstuhl seminar on Open Scholarly Information Systems in September was the trigger for me to finally start the work on using machine learning to classify Rogue Scholar blog posts into subject areas. Implementation Two months later I now have a classifier running with the CWTS/OpenAlex model provided via Hugging Face, and integrated into the Rogue Scholar infrastructure. The InvenioRDM repository platform that powers Rogue Scholar has built-in subject classification with the OECD Fields of Science since v6.o released in August 2021 , but this can easily be extended with custom vocabularies. Rogue Scholar now has these four hierarchical OpenAlex vocabularies built in: OpenAlex subject areas Any InvenioRDM instance can install these vocabularies in yaml format and make them available in the record editor and API, and I will also include them in the InvenioRDM Starter pre-built Docker image. I have used the subfields (that map to ASJC) to classify all participating blogs, and updated the  Rogue Scholar submission form to use the OpenAlex subfields instead of the OECD Fields of Science. Please fill out the form (also linked from the footer of every Rogue Scholar page) if you don't agree with the suggested subfield (multiple subfields are not yet supported). Rogue Scholar has created communities for each of the 252 subfields , and has reused existing OECD subject communities where it makes sense. It will take a few weeks before all blog posts are properly sorted into these new OpenAlex subfield communities. The OpenAlex classifier is now running in the Rogue Scholar infrastructure and has started classifying using the blog post title and abstract (as the model was trained with this information). After classifying a few hundred blog posts, I found a score of at least 0.25 to be a good cutoff. With lower scores the number of false-positives was too high, whereas with higher scores (e.g. 0.40 ) the number of false-negatives was too high. More systematic testing of cutoff scores will follow in a few months, but it is clear that more than half of the classified posts currently have a score that is too low, and false-positives have to be removed. An example of the latter is a post about the Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information that was classified as topic Optics and Image Analysis with a score of 0.40 . What I found so far is that non-English language posts classify well ( 14% are in other languages ), and that posts that can't be classified are often not sciency enough, e.g. they talk about an upcoming webinar or general tools or techniques. The subfield of the blog and the topic of the post, together with the corresponding topic subfield are shown in the sidebar of the Rogue Scholar post \u2013 again it will take a few weeks to generate this information for all posts. Keywords and subjects for datasafe: Implementing a Dark Archive with InvenioRDM The post is also added to the corresponding subfield communities, in the example above Information Systems and Conservation . The community ID corresponds to the OpenAlex subfield ID ( here 1206 ), and OpenAlex IDs can also be used in Rogue Scholar Search: Search by OpenAlex subfield Next steps As I mentioned before, the next few weeks will be spent updating the subject classification data, tweaking the user interface, making the Rogue Scholar classifier instance handle more traffic, and generally respond to user feedback. For community validation I wrote an integration into the Rogue Scholar Slack (join via this link ) using the workflow automation service n8n , also self-hosted on Rogue Scholar infrastructure. Very soon, I will convert this into a proper chatbot that can trigger the classification directly from Slack, or give feedback if a classification is wrong. As this might also be of interest to other repositories running the InvenioRDM software, I also built a similar integration into the Inveniosoftware Discord server, testing the classification with a few Zenodo records: As I am using the same metadata and classifier model as OpenAlex, I can compare their classifications \u2013 all Rogue Scholar posts should be archived in OpenAlex. The example post Reinvestigating the reported transition state structure of a concerted triple H-tunneling mechanism was classified into topic Chemical Reactions and Isotopes by both OpenAlex and Rogue Scholar . Also interesting is a systematic comparison of abstracts and full-text for classifier input, preliminary testing didn't show much difference, and the model was trained with abstracts. Finally, this approach (OpenAlex subfield and topic classification and pre-trained model made available with an open license) can also work for other Crossref members interested in subject classification, and might convince Crossref to add subject area classification to the metadata schema, something the recently launched Crossref Metadata Advisory Group is thinking about. In 2026 Rogue Scholar will use this new infrastructure to address important use cases around Understanding and Discovery . Please use Slack , email , Mastodon , or Bluesky if you have any questions or comments regarding this work, and join the Rogue Scholar Slack if you want to provide feedback on concrete classifications. Rogue Scholar is a scholarly infrastructure that is free for all authors and readers.

Find similar publications to the one you just read via Rogue Scholar.</li></ul><p>A good example of the first use case is a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-02-2025-0053\" rel=\"noreferrer\">study recently published</a> by Catharina Ochser and colleagues about scholarly blogs in Germany, and one of the main outcomes was the disciplinary distribution of these blogs:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"Rogue Scholar is improving subject classification (Version 2)\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://blog.front-matter.de/content/images/2025/12/jd-02-2025-0053001.png\" width=\"1255\" /><figcaption><b><strong style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Fig. 1</strong></b><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> Overlap of disciplines.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The majority of the blogs they found were in the humanities and social sciences. One important reason for this is <a href=\"https://de.hypotheses.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">de.hypotheses</a>, the German-language version of the large blog portal Hypotheses, offering hosting and other services to humanities and social sciences blogs. </p><p>Five years ago in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/r79rdp1-97aq74v-ag4nb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Make Data Count project</a>, we were interested in the subject classification of research data, as usage of datasets is highly dependent on community size and community standards. One big problem was that the standardized subject classification of datasets was mostly lacking, so we started making this easier for DataCite members: push for the OECD Fields of Science as the standard subject area vocabulary that can be mapped from other vocabularies, and show the OECD Fields of Science as a facet in the search results of DataCite Search.</p><p>The second use case is primarily driven by readers. After reading an interesting science blog post, they might want to read more posts with similar content. Or they have an idea about the content they are looking for, but it is poorly described using keywords. Blogging platforms have long provided this functionality, but have been limited to a single blog and have used old technology, rather than <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.59350/d22rx-srr93\" rel=\"noreferrer\">semantic search</a>.</p><h3 id=\"limitations\">Limitations</h3><p>Rogue Scholar launched&#xa0;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/9zb20-k8z13\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OECD Fields of Science subject area support for every blog post</a>&#xa0;in February of this year. While this was a good start, there were three significant shortcomings:</p><ul><li>Subject area classification was at the blog level, not for individual posts,</li><li>With 48 subject areas, the OECD Fields of Science are too broad for some important use cases,</li><li>Crossref metadata don&apos;t support subject area metadata.</li></ul><p>When submitting a blog to be archived by Rogue Scholar, one of only a few questions I ask blog authors is for the subject area of their blog using the OECD Fields of Science list. Similar to the subject classification of journals rather than journal articles (which, unfortunately is more often done), this approach has limitations, in particular for multidisciplinary blogs/journals. One prominent example in Rogue Scholar is the <em>SVPOW</em> blog, which has been writing about sauropods since October 2007, but also frequently <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.59350/cbmpt-b8k31\" rel=\"noreferrer\">publishes about Open Access</a>.</p><p>The six top-level and 42 second-level subject areas in the OECD Fields of Science are good enough for many high-level questions, such as R&amp;D spending or doctoral students per country and/or over time. But for more fine-grained questions, more granularity in the subject classification is needed. There are for example almost 20,000 social science and almost 5,000 computer and information science blog posts in Rogue Scholar, which give a very broad picture.</p><p>Using a more granular subject area classification applied to each publication is a major challenge, as can for example be seen in the major curation effort needed to classify the biomedical literature into Medical Subject Headings (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">MeSH</a>) at PubMed.</p><p>The third major limitation is that publishers can&apos;t easily distribute subject classification information, as Crossref metadata can&apos;t hold that information. DataCite is better in this regard, but unfortunately subject area metadata is still only included in a small fraction of DataCite DOIs.</p><h3 id=\"ideas\">Ideas</h3><p>For Rogue Scholar, I always envisioned a semi-automated approach based on machine learning and human curation of edge cases. Having the full-text of all blog posts available in machine-readable form makes this possible, but picking the right subject area classification and building a classification workflow from scratch are still major challenges.</p><p>The ideal subject area classification is more granular than OECD, covers all scholarly disciplines, is widely used (and documented), and openly available. My main candidate five years ago, when I did the subject area work for DataCite, was the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/6BB427AB9696C225CA2574180004463E?opendocument\">Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC) Fields of Research</a> with more than 1000 subject areas, and used for example by the repository Figshare. The German Research Foundation (DFG) Subject Areas used by the Registry of Research Data Repositories (<a href=\"https://www.re3data.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">re3data</a>), on the other hand, have some limitations, primarily that they were developed for a different use case - panels for grant evaluation.</p><p>The CWTS/OpenAlex classification <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.59350/qc0px-76778\" rel=\"noreferrer\">announced in January 2024</a> with about 4500 topics categorized into subfields and fields that map to the All Science Journal Classification (<a href=\"https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/12007/supporthub/scopus/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ASJC</a>) is a very attractive alternative, especially since OpenAlex uses it, makes an open API available, and more importantly&#xa0;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/OpenAlex/bert-base-multilingual-cased-finetuned-openalex-topic-classification-title-abstract\" rel=\"noreferrer\">makes the pre-trained model available for download</a>&#xa0;with an Apache 2.0 open source license. This makes it straightforward to run the classifier on Rogue Scholar infrastructure and not depend on external APIs with associated costs and rate-limits.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"Rogue Scholar is improving subject classification (Version 2)\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"2048\" src=\"https://blog.front-matter.de/content/images/2025/11/3849275338_dec5fa17a1_k.jpg\" width=\"1536\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/6S9xsb\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">flickr photo by Eva Amsen</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Like many interesting collaborations, a conversation with Nees Jan van Eck from CWTS at a Dagstuhl seminar on<a href=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/25381\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&#xa0;Open Scholarly Information Systems</a>&#xa0;in September was the trigger for me to finally start the work on using machine learning to classify Rogue Scholar blog posts into subject areas. </p><h3 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h3><p>Two months later I now have a classifier running with the CWTS/OpenAlex model provided via Hugging Face, and integrated into the Rogue Scholar infrastructure.</p><p>The InvenioRDM repository platform that powers Rogue Scholar has built-in subject classification with the OECD Fields of Science since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.63517/ep4p0-vnx69\" rel=\"noreferrer\">v6.o released in August 2021</a>, but this can easily be extended with custom vocabularies. Rogue Scholar now has these four hierarchical OpenAlex vocabularies built in:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"Rogue Scholar is improving subject classification (Version 2)\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://blog.front-matter.de/content/images/2025/12/subject_areas.png\" width=\"512\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://help.openalex.org/hc/en-us/articles/24736129405719-Topics\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">OpenAlex subject areas</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Any InvenioRDM instance can install <a href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar/tree/main/app_data/vocabularies\" rel=\"noreferrer\">these vocabularies in yaml format</a> and make them available in the record editor and API, and I will also include them in the <a href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/invenio-rdm-starter\" rel=\"noreferrer\">InvenioRDM Starter</a> pre-built Docker image. </p><p>I have used the subfields (that map to ASJC) to classify all participating blogs, and updated the  Rogue Scholar submission form to use the OpenAlex subfields instead of the OECD Fields of Science. Please fill out the <a href=\"https://tally.so/r/nPvNK0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">form</a> (also linked from the footer of every Rogue Scholar page) if you don&apos;t agree with the suggested subfield (multiple subfields are not yet supported).</p><p>Rogue Scholar has created <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/me/communities?q=&amp;f=type%3Asubject&amp;l=list&amp;p=1&amp;s=10&amp;sort=newest\" rel=\"noreferrer\">communities for each of the 252 subfields</a>, and has reused existing OECD subject communities where it makes sense. It will take a few weeks before all blog posts are properly sorted into these new OpenAlex subfield communities.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"Rogue Scholar is improving subject classification (Version 2)\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"206\" src=\"https://media.tenor.com/xFRvGx7feb4AAAAC/sorting-hat.gif\" width=\"498\" /></figure><p>The OpenAlex classifier is now running in the Rogue Scholar infrastructure and has started classifying using the blog post title and abstract (as the model was trained with this information). After classifying a few hundred blog posts, I found a score of at least <strong>0.25</strong> to be a good cutoff. With lower scores the number of false-positives was too high, whereas with higher scores (e.g. <strong>0.40</strong>) the number of false-negatives was too high. More systematic testing of cutoff scores will follow in a few months, but it is clear that more than half of the classified posts currently have a score that is too low, and false-positives have to be removed. An example of the latter is a post about the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.57689/DINI-BLOG.20250106\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information</a> that was classified as topic <a href=\"https://openalex.org/topics/t14320\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Optics and Image Analysis</a> with a score of <strong>0.40</strong>. </p><p>What I found so far is that non-English language posts classify well (<a href=\"https://docs.rogue-scholar.org/dashboard.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">14% are in other languages</a>), and that posts that can&apos;t be classified are often not <em>sciency</em> enough, e.g. they talk about an upcoming webinar or general tools or techniques.</p><p>The subfield of the blog and the topic of the post, together with the corresponding topic subfield are shown in the sidebar of the Rogue Scholar post &#x2013; again it will take a few weeks to generate this information for all posts.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"Rogue Scholar is improving subject classification (Version 2)\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://blog.front-matter.de/content/images/2025/12/Bildschirmfoto-2025-12-03-um-19.55.10.png\" width=\"752\" /><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Keywords and subjects for </span><a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/records/jghjv-61d13\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">datasafe: Implementing a Dark Archive with InvenioRDM</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>The post is also added to the corresponding subfield communities, in the example above <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/communities/1710\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Information Systems</a> and <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/communities/1206\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Conservation</a>.

The example post <strong>Reinvestigating the reported transition state structure of a concerted triple H-tunneling mechanism</strong> was classified into topic <a href=\"https://explore.openalex.org/topics/t13561\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chemical Reactions and Isotopes</a> by both <a href=\"https://openalex.org/works?page=1&amp;filter=ids.openalex:w7106274180\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OpenAlex</a> and <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/records/rz8cf-4pp02\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rogue Scholar</a>. Also interesting is a systematic comparison of abstracts and full-text for classifier input, preliminary testing didn&apos;t show much difference, and the model was trained with abstracts. </p><p>Finally, this approach (OpenAlex subfield and topic classification and pre-trained model made available with an open license) can also work for other Crossref members interested in subject classification, and might convince Crossref to add subject area classification to the metadata schema, something the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.64000/n23nw-3d593\" rel=\"noreferrer\">recently launched Crossref Metadata Advisory Group</a>&#xa0;is thinking about.</p><p>In 2026 Rogue Scholar will use this new infrastructure to address important use cases around <strong>Understanding</strong> and <strong>Discovery</strong>.</p><p>Please use&#xa0;<a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/rogue-scholar/shared_invite/zt-2ylpq1yoy-o~TkxDarfz5LSMhGSCYtiA\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Slack</a>,&#xa0;<a href=\"mailto:info@rogue-scholar.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">email</a>,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://wisskomm.social/@rogue_scholar\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mastodon</a>, or&#xa0;<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/rogue-scholar.bsky.social\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bluesky</a>&#xa0;if you have any questions or comments regarding this work, and join the Rogue Scholar Slack if you want to provide feedback on concrete classifications.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Rogue Scholar is a scholarly infrastructure that is free for all authors and readers.

Communal with Partner This year is a milestone for us because we\u2019re going to finally get married. Besides that, we\u2019re also going to move in together and potentially even more cities! This year is full of change, so I think the biggest thing on my mind is to enjoy the time for what it is. Document enjoyable moments. 1. Health Reach a 45 VO2 max on Apple Watch or above. In fact, this year I reached a peak of 48 VO2 max on my Apple Watch. I think this is a good goal to keep up with. Next year, I think I can optimize my training, hit 50, and do a legit VO2 max test. Run another 10k and half marathon. I did not run another half marathon, but I did run a 10k with a 7:11 min/mile pace. I think I can do better next year, and aim for a sub 7:30 min/mile pace for a half marathon. Lose 10 lbs to a steady 160 lbs. I did hit a steady 160 due to running a lot, but I think I can be a bit healthier and aim for 155 lbs, while consistently working out and maintaining my salad diet during the weekdays. Hit under a 100 in golf. Haven\u2019t had too much time this year. Take 1 hot-yoga class per month, or more. Surprisingly, was able to accomplish this using classpass! I think I can continue this goal next year. 2. Professional This year is a bit hard to figure out. On one hand, I\u2019m still very much interested in having a career in research and potentially academia. On the other hand, I understand the challenges of finding a geographical location both my partner and I would live at, with sufficient pay with a fulfilling career. With that in mind, I set a few goals assuming my postdoc will come to an end towards the later half of this year. Finish my JMLR paper on causal discovery across multiple environments. A lot of the paper was cleaned up this year, and I\u2019m hoping Get MIGHT paper published. This paper improved drastically, and is now in review at PNAS! Finish scikit-tree development of hypothesis testing (via OSPO) and causal effect estimation (via VISS Schmidt Futures and OSPO). The VISS Schmidt folks were very collaborative with this work, and were able to explore the design space of the tree codebase in Cython. I think our future work will have to involve C++ and CRTP template design to avoid inheritence-based polymorphism. Write one new paper on causal inference related to either causal discovery, or causal representation learning. Got a 2024 NeurIPS paper that does some cool theory and experimental work on causal representation learning. Finish series of PRs to add missing-value support for ExtraTrees in scikit-learn. Became a scikit-learn core developer this year! 3. Misc. / Outreach / Societal Impact Schedule 5-6 blood donations this year. Only hit 4 this year, but I think I can do better next year. Maintain a greater than 600 day streak in Duolingo. Continuing this goal from last year. Hit a 600+ day streak this year. Read 2-3 books this year in my spare time at night. I think I can do better next year. 2025 Goals: Wow this year was crazy! I got married to my partner, moved in together, and started a new job at Amazon as a Senior Applied Scientist.

The results show that women who were notified of their dense breasts (which can hide small cancers on a mammogram, making them harder to detect) felt more anxious and confused about their breast health 8 weeks after their screening appointment, and were more likely to want advice from their general practitioner (GP) about what to do next,\u00a0despite the lack of clear evidence-based and equitable clinical pathways. As such, the researchers say that population breast density notification \u201cshould be carefully considered owing to potential adverse outcomes.\u201d Breast density notification is already mandatory in the US,\u00a0is moving in that direction in Australia,\u00a0and being considered in other countries including the UK on the premise that it helps women to make more informed decisions about their breast health. But robust evidence on whether the benefits of notifying women\u00a0who are having mammography screening\u00a0outweigh the potential harms is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, researchers in Australia set out to investigate the real-world impact of notifying women of their dense breasts\u00a0on their psychosocial outcomes\u00a0and their health service use intentions. Their findings are based on data from 2,401 women (average age 57) screened as part of the\u00a0national population-based screening programme\u00a0between September 2023 and July 2024 who were classified as having dense breasts\u00a0(BI-RADS category C and D). Details such as age, language/s spoken, and personal and family history of cancer were collected and women were randomised to either standard \u201ccontrol\u201d care (no notification of breast density in their results letter), notification of breast density plus written information about breast density and its implications (intervention 1), or notification of density plus a link to online video based information (intervention 2). After 8 weeks, women reported their prior awareness of breast density, self-rated health and wellbeing, health literacy, and preferences for more or less healthcare. They were also surveyed about their\u00a0psychological\u00a0response to their results (feeling anxious, confused, or informed) and their intentions to talk to their GP and pursue additional screening. Compared with the control group, women notified of their breast density had greater odds of feeling anxious (control: 18%; intervention 1: 20.8%; intervention 2: 20.5%) and were significantly more confused (control: 2.7%; intervention 1: 11.5%; intervention 2: 9%)\u00a0about what to do. Both notified groups also had significantly higher intentions to talk to their GP about their screening results (intervention 1: 22.8%; intervention 2: 19.4%) compared with the control arm (12.9%), although most women did not intend to have additional screening. And notified women did not feel better informed to make decisions about their breast health compared with controls. The authors acknowledge several limitations including the low proportion of women from non-English speaking backgrounds in the trial. However, they say this is the first international trial to rigorously evaluate the immediate consequences of breast density notification, providing key evidence for breast cancer screening programmes outside of the US contemplating introducing density notification or legislation. They conclude: \u201cInternationally, as the momentum for risk based breast cancer screening continues, breast density will continue to be a risk factor of focus. However, waiting for additional data on beneficial and equitable clinical pathways and carefully planning the provision of breast density information in the context of other risk factors for women may be prudent to ensure that both the short term and longer term benefits outweigh potential harms.\u201d 03/12/2025 Notes for editors Research : Impact of population based breast density notification: three arm screening programme embedded randomised controlled trial doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-083649 Journal: The BMJ External funding: National Health and Medical Research Council, National Breast Cancer Foundation, Cancer Screening Unit, Department of Health, Queensland Government Link to Academy of Medical Sciences press release labelling system: http://press.psprings.co.uk/AMSlabels.pdf Externally peer reviewed?

        "full_content": "I\u2019ve mentioned in a couple of earlier posts that I spent ten formative years of my life\u2014including all of my teenage years\u2014in England. At some point during that period I developed a love of literature. But it was love at a distance, as one might feel for a starry night or unruly waves crashing into rocks. If there were hidden messages in the words, they were not meant for me, or for anyone with my particular intersection of cultural competences. That changed suddenly when a friend handed me a copy of Midnight\u2019s Children , Salman Rushdie\u2019s second novel. I could see right away that this magnificent book would entrance readers from every corner of the world, but also that some expressions would only be partially grasped by those who didn\u2019t share the author\u2019s linguistic and cultural history. Consider an example. When I first opened the book and scanned the table of contents, I noticed (among other things) a chapter called \u201cThe Buddha.\u201d What came to mind was the ascetic who founded a religion, sitting cross-legged in meditative contemplation. But once the chapter itself was reached almost four hundred pages later, it turned out that the reference was (also) to a different word entirely, much harsher in sound and meaning, an epithet for a decrepit old man. Two words so opposite in tone, united by the limits of transliteration, both suitable nicknames for the book\u2019s protagonist Saleem Sinai at that point in his life\u2019s journey: O fortunate ambiguity of transliteration! The Urdu word buddha, meaning old man, is pronounced with the Ds hard and plosive. But there is also Buddha, with soft tongued Ds, meaning he who achieved enlightenment under the bodhi tree. This passage will feel different to those who have spoken and heard both words over the course of their lives. Such a connection between author and reader, trivial as it might seem, meant something to me. I devoured Rushdie\u2019s next two novels, Shame and The Satanic Verses , both masterpieces every bit as entrancing as their predecessor. Salman Rushdie was at the Sydney Goldstein Theater in San Francisco earlier this month, in conversation with Poulomi Saha. 1 He has recently published a collection of stories, and disclosed at the event that the second of these\u2014 The Musician of Kahani \u2014was the first to be written. It\u2019s about eighty pages in length, more a novella than a short story, and according to the author will be the last to be set on the hill in Bombay where he was born. In fact, he says as much in the story itself, which concludes with a parting message to the fictional characters (including Saleem) who once inhabited the same neighborhood. The Musician of Kahani is the story of a girl with prodigious (and increasingly magical) musical talent, born to two mathematicians\u2014a mother who develops an early search engine that she sells to an American for a hundred million dollars, and a father who  is on the verge of publishing a proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem when he is \u201cbeaten to the punch by a British scholar.\u201d The story is hilarious in parts, horrifying in others, and so beautifully crafted that I felt transported back to those early days of discovery. Here is one passage: And her concerts! Our people are not reticent about expressing their appreciation in the presence of greatness. \u201c Wah! \u201d we cry out. \u201cWow!\u201d And also \u201c Kya baat hai! ,\u201d \u201cWhat a thing!\u201d And we do this during, not at the end of, the performance. Beethoven would not have approved, nor even the giggly showman Mozart (as portrayed in Forman\u2019s Amadeus ). Those gents expected to be heard in reverential silence and applauded when they were done. Well too bad Ludwig van, Wolfgang A.! You\u2019re in India now. And here, during is the way. Here the performer and the audience are as one. Each lifts the other higher. Again, this will land differently on the ears of someone accustomed to hearing (or shouting out) \u201c Bahut Khoob! \u201d during brief pauses between successive Urdu couplets at a dinner party recital. 2 The fatwa , and the years of fear and hiding in its wake, had an impact on Rushdie\u2019s writing. How could they not? I certainly felt that no subsequent work of fiction reached the towering heights of his second, third, and fourth novels. 3 Until now. The Musician of Kahani is truly magnificent. 4 Could it be that what the dagger hanging over his head killed in his fiction was brought back to life by his survival of a brutal stabbing? The idea is absurd, of course, but would not be out of place in a Rushdie story. Salman Rushdie in conversation with Poulomi Saha on November 16, 2025. 1 I\u2019m in the Bay area for the academic year , working on a book tentatively called The Interpretation of Signals . This was my second visit to the theater\u2014the first was to see Arundhati Roy in conversation with Deepa Fernandes, who is also currently a fellow at CASBS. Roy\u2019s latest book Mother Mary Comes To Me is on my reading list for the holidays, as is a recent biography of James Baldwin by Nicholas Boggs that was mentioned by Rushdie during the conversation. 2 I have focused in this post on author-reader ties that are linguistic and cultural in nature, but some of the deepest connections transcend ethnic boundaries. 3 His non-fiction was also affected but in different ways; my favorite Rushdie essay was written shortly after the fatwa was imposed. 4 Here\u2019s another passage I can\u2019t resist quoting. This one describes the path taken by the musician\u2019s father, Raheem Contractor, in seeking a proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem (a path that eventually leads him to abandon his family for a religious cult): Raheem had examined and rejected all attempts to untangle the thorny conundrum, delving into the intricacies of the Yang-Mills equations, the Riemann Hypothesis, the P versus NP problem, the Hodge conjecture, the Navier-Stokes equations, the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, and found them all wanting. At last, after many long years, he had begun to understand that the answer lay within the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, subsequently known as the Modularity Theorem and was on the verge of publishing his proof, when he was beaten to the punch by a British scholar, who became famous and was showered with honors and awards, while Raheem Contractor remained anonymous in his university office. He was inconsolable, and his lifelong faith in numbers, and in his ability to use them as the building blocks of a good life, began to dissolve. He became vulnerable to other forms of belief. This is a typical Rushdie detour from the story at hand. I know next to nothing about these very technical branches of mathematics but am dimly aware that something called the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil Conjecture implies Fermat\u2019s claim, and that this was the path taken by Andrew Wiles in his celebrated proof .",
        "raw_html": "<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned in a couple of <a href=\"https://rajivsethi.substack.com/p/two-lives-in-one-day\">earlier</a> <a href=\"https://rajivsethi.substack.com/p/echoes-of-1983\">posts</a> that I spent ten formative years of my life&#8212;including all of my teenage years&#8212;in England. At some point during that period I developed a love of literature. But it was love at a distance, as one might feel for a starry night or unruly waves crashing into rocks. If there were hidden messages in the words, they were not meant for me, or for anyone with my particular intersection of cultural competences. </p><p>That changed suddenly when a friend handed me a copy of <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Midnight_s_Children/IT6vfrb5fNcC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\">Midnight&#8217;s Children</a></em>, Salman Rushdie&#8217;s second novel. I could see right away that this magnificent book would entrance readers from every corner of the world, but also that some expressions would only be partially grasped by those who didn&#8217;t share the author&#8217;s linguistic and cultural history. </p><p>Consider an example. When I first opened the book and scanned the table of contents, I noticed (among other things) a chapter called &#8220;The Buddha.&#8221; What came to mind was the ascetic who founded a religion, sitting cross-legged in meditative contemplation. But once the chapter itself was reached almost four hundred pages later, it turned out that the reference was (also) to a <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=tw-ob&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A2%E0%A4%BE&amp;op=translate\">different word</a> entirely, much harsher in sound and meaning, an epithet for a decrepit old man. Two words so opposite in tone, united by the limits of transliteration, both suitable nicknames for the book&#8217;s protagonist Saleem Sinai at that point in his life&#8217;s journey:</p><blockquote><p>O fortunate ambiguity of transliteration! The Urdu word buddha, meaning old man, is pronounced with the Ds hard and plosive. But there is also Buddha, with soft tongued Ds, meaning he who achieved enlightenment under the bodhi tree.</p></blockquote><p>This <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Midnight_s_Children/NKzepmTUipEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22O+fortunate+ambiguity+of+transliteration%22&amp;pg=PA402&amp;printsec=frontcover\">passage</a> will <em>feel</em> different to those who have spoken and heard both words over the course of their lives. Such a connection between author and reader, trivial as it might seem, meant something to me. I devoured Rushdie&#8217;s next two novels, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Shame/ku3E2X6OgeQC\">Shame</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/3cQGQomF524C\">The Satanic Verses</a></em>, both masterpieces every bit as entrancing as their predecessor. </p><p>Salman Rushdie was at the Sydney Goldstein Theater in San Francisco earlier this month, in <a href=\"https://www.cityarts.net/event/salman-rushdie-3/\">conversation</a> with Poulomi Saha.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> He has recently published a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Eleventh_Hour/OO1PEQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\">collection</a> of stories, and disclosed at the event that the second of these&#8212;<em>The Musician of Kahani</em>&#8212;was the first to be written. It&#8217;s about eighty pages in length, more a novella than a short story, and according to the author will be the last to be set on the hill in Bombay where he was born. In fact, he says as much in the story itself, which concludes with a parting message to the fictional characters (including Saleem) who once inhabited the same neighborhood.</p><p><em>The Musician of Kahani</em> is the story of a girl with prodigious (and increasingly magical) musical talent, born to two mathematicians&#8212;a mother who develops an early search engine that she sells to an American for a hundred million dollars, and a father who  is on the verge of publishing a proof of <em>Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem</em> when he is &#8220;beaten to the punch by a British scholar.&#8221; The story is hilarious in parts, horrifying in others, and so beautifully crafted that I felt transported back to those early days of discovery. </p><p>Here is one passage:</p><blockquote><p>And her concerts! Our people are not reticent about expressing their appreciation in the presence of greatness. &#8220;<em>Wah!</em>&#8221; we cry out. &#8220;Wow!&#8221; And also &#8220;<em>Kya baat hai!</em>,&#8221; &#8220;What a thing!&#8221; And we do this during, not at the end of, the performance. Beethoven would not have approved, nor even the giggly showman Mozart (as portrayed in Forman&#8217;s <em>Amadeus</em>). Those gents expected to be heard in reverential silence and applauded when they were done. Well too bad Ludwig van, Wolfgang A.! You&#8217;re in India now. And here, during is the way. Here the performer and the audience are as one. Each lifts the other higher.</p></blockquote><p>Again, this will land differently on the ears of someone accustomed to <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A4%20%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%AC&amp;op=translate\">hearing</a> (or shouting out) &#8220;<em>Bahut Khoob!</em>&#8221; during brief pauses between successive Urdu couplets at a dinner party recital.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/nyregion/salman-rushdie-fatwa-satanic-verses.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E8.IQ9J.hOWYwUWvTCce&amp;smid=url-share\">fatwa</a>, and the years of fear and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/nyregion/salman-rushdie-fatwa-satanic-verses.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E8.IQ9J.hOWYwUWvTCce&amp;smid=url-share\">hiding</a> in its wake, had an impact on Rushdie&#8217;s writing. How could they not? I certainly felt that no subsequent work of fiction reached the towering heights of his second, third, and fourth novels.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> Until now. <em>The Musician of Kahani</em> is truly magnificent.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> Could it be that what the dagger hanging over his head killed in his fiction was brought back to life by his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/08/12/nyregion/salman-rushdie-stabbed-new-york?unlocked_article_code=1.4E8.jPwh.JXamWiQQCJkJ&amp;smid=url-share\">survival</a> of a brutal stabbing? The idea is absurd, of course, but would not be out of place in a Rushdie story.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JAbc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e16b9fa-5f16-4be0-8e54-af798b460d7b_1080x805.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"298.14814814814815\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JAbc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e16b9fa-5f16-4be0-8e54-af798b460d7b_1080x805.jpeg\" width=\"400\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Salman Rushdie in <a href=\"https://www.cityarts.net/event/salman-rushdie-3/\">conversation</a> with Poulomi Saha on November 16, 2025.</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" id=\"footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I&#8217;m in the Bay area for the <a href=\"https://casbs.stanford.edu/people/rajiv-sethi\">academic year</a>, working on a book tentatively <a href=\"https://rajivsethi.substack.com/p/the-interpretation-of-signals\">called</a> <em>The Interpretation of Signals</em>.

But recent federal deployments have changed the landscape and raised pressing questions about how far a president\u2019s domestic military powers can go. On a recent episode of Stanford Legal , podcast host Professor Pam Karlan sat down with Professor Bernadette Meyler , JD \u201903, the Carl and Sheila Spaeth Professor of Law, to talk about about the growing use of the National Guard for domestic law enforcement and what it reveals about shifting boundaries of presidential power. Professor Bernie Meyler Meyler is also an expert on presidential pardoning power and is the author of the book Theaters of Pardoning (Cornell University Press, 2019). The following Q&A is an edited and shortened version of the full podcast transcript, which can be found here . Pam Karlan: There\u2019s a federal statute that allows the president to call National Guard units into federal service when the U.S. is invaded or threatened with invasion, facing rebellion, or when the president can\u2019t execute the laws with regular forces. President Trump has been invoking this power in ways we haven\u2019t really seen since the civil-rights era. You\u2019ve been looking closely at this, including what\u2019s happening now in California and Illinois. Bernadette Meyler: Part of the backdrop here is the Supreme Court\u2019s recent presidential-immunity decision, which held that presidents are immune for their official acts. That ruling effectively gives Trump more room to exercise powers that might previously have been checked. There\u2019s also a connection to the pardon power: the National Guard is being used to support ICE and immigration-enforcement operations, and if civil rights violations occur in the process, those involved could potentially be pardoned by the president. Given how broadly the pardon power is understood today, that possibility looms large. Pam Karlan: Let\u2019s start with the operations themselves. In Illinois, we have \u201cOperation Midway Blitz,\u201d and there\u2019s a similar operation in Los Angeles. What were these initial ICE-led operations designed to do? Bernadette Meyler: They were designed to ramp up immigration enforcement\u2014targeting people the administration considers to have violated immigration laws or to be unlawfully present in the country. Portland has seen similar activity. And the rhetoric around these operations makes clear they\u2019re aimed at Democratic-leaning cities viewed as \u201charboring\u201d undocumented immigrants. The enforcement has been very clearly targeted at those urban areas. Listen to the Full Podcast Pam Karlan: And unlike past ICE raids\u2014say, at meat-packing plants\u2014these are happening right in the middle of cities where many residents, including citizens fully entitled to be here, strongly object. You have demonstrations, whistle-blowing networks, people warning communities about ICE activity. And you also have local police forces in these cities, right? Bernadette Meyler: Exactly. In California, local police said they were fully capable of handling any issues that arose. There was some violence in Los Angeles, but LAPD reported they were managing it. Governor Newsom also made clear that the state did not need National Guard assistance. That\u2019s part of what makes the federal deployment so unusual. Generally, when the Guard is federalized, the governor consents. Here, President Trump deployed Guard units in Los Angeles without even notifying Governor Newsom. Pam Karlan: Even though it\u2019s called the National Guard, it\u2019s usually under the command of each state\u2019s governor. Historically\u2014and this goes back to your work as a legal historian\u2014the Guard is the successor to the early state militias, which were meant to remain under local control rather than operate as a national standing army. Bernadette Meyler: Exactly. The militias that became the National Guard were fundamentally local bodies. That\u2019s why the recent use of the Texas National Guard outside Texas is so striking. We\u2019ve seen Texas Guard units deployed to Illinois, and the administration has even threatened to send them into other states as well. That bypasses the ordinary respect for state sovereignty\u2014deploying forces into a state without consulting its governor. It also raises the very real concern of one state\u2019s militia being used against another, which historically would have been viewed as an invasion. Pam Karlan: And now the president has federalized the Guard and is bringing in units from Texas, presumably because he doubts whether Guard members from Illinois will carry out the tasks he wants. Under the statute, though, the president can only do this if there\u2019s an invasion, a rebellion, or an inability to enforce federal law. Who gets to decide whether those conditions exist? Bernadette Meyler: That question is at the center of the legal battles unfolding in both California and Illinois\u2014cases that have already reached the Supreme Court. The administration\u2019s position is that the president can federalize the Guard because he\u2019s \u201cunable to execute the laws\u201d with regular forces, pointing to alleged threats of violence against ICE officials in these locations. In California, a Ninth Circuit panel took a very deferential view. It held that the president\u2019s determination should stand so long as it reflects a \u201ccolorable assessment\u201d of the facts and falls within a \u201crange of honest judgment.\u201d What exactly that means is unclear\u2014and it gives the president considerable leeway. The Seventh Circuit was also deferential, but not quite as deferential as the Ninth. It looked more closely at the statutory terms\u2014what counts as a \u201crebellion\u201d or an \u201cinability to execute the laws\u201d\u2014and suggested that courts still have a role in interpreting those thresholds. So, at this point, the circuit courts have granted the president some deference, but not total deference. And there\u2019s an ongoing debate about where that deference should lie: with the president\u2019s assessment of the facts on the ground, or with the courts\u2019 interpretation of the legal standards themselves. Pam Karlan: For generations, courts have relied on the \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d \u2014 the idea that the government acts in good faith and considers the right factors. How long can that presumption hold with this administration? Bernadette Meyler: It\u2019s a real concern. I\u2019d like to think we can retain the presumption of regularity, but it becomes hard when decisions aren\u2019t adequately explained or aren\u2019t consistent with historical practice. Even if the president were to articulate a broad view of what it means to be \u201cunable to execute the laws,\u201d that interpretation would be far outside what we\u2019ve seen over the past several centuries. If this becomes a new norm, it raises the prospect of continuous National Guard deployment\u2014and, if the Insurrection Act is invoked, even broader use of the military across the country. We\u2019ve already seen proposals to have the Guard monitor elections in some places. So the presumption of regularity is under significant strain right now. Pam Karlan: The idea of using the National Guard to monitor elections has been floated. Where does that even come from, legally or historically? Bernadette Meyler: There are very narrow historical situations where the Guard\u2014or the military\u2014was used domestically under the Insurrection Act. During the civil rights era, for example, the federal government deployed the military to enforce desegregation when states used armed resistance to prevent Black children from entering schools. If a state today tried to nullify an election, you could imagine a similar federal role to enforce federal law. But that goes directly to the trigger. If there\u2019s no evidence that federal election laws can\u2019t be enforced, there\u2019s no justification for using the National Guard. What such a deployment would do is intimidate voters\u2014an obvious benefit to those seeking to suppress turnout\u2014but without an inability to enforce federal law, there\u2019s no lawful basis. And it\u2019s important to remember that federal law has long prohibited the military from interfering in elections. A statute that\u2019s been on the books for more than a century bars officers of the Army and Navy\u2014later amended to include the Air Force\u2014from participating in elections precisely because American law assumes the military is for fighting abroad, not policing voters at home. This is also where the Posse Comitatus Act becomes crucial. Since 1878, it has prohibited the use of the military for domestic law enforcement unless Congress specifically authorizes it. That prohibition forms the backdrop for both the current deployment of the National Guard and the president\u2019s suggestions about invoking the Insurrection Act. Pam Karlan: And we don\u2019t currently have any congressional authorization for using the military for domestic law enforcement. Bernadette Meyler: Exactly. The only statute that could authorize that is the Insurrection Act. It allows the president to use the militia or armed forces to enforce federal authority when there\u2019s a rebellion or when enforcing the laws has become \u201cimpracticable.\u201d And it has a built-in requirement: before invoking the Act, the president must issue a proclamation ordering people to disperse if they\u2019re believed to be engaged in an insurrection. But even the administration doesn\u2019t seriously claim that what\u2019s happening now is an insurrection\u2014those arguments appear only as secondary defenses in court. Their primary claim is \u201cnecessity to enforce the laws,\u201d the idea that regular law enforcement isn\u2019t functioning properly. That brings us right back to who decides that question and the degree of deference courts are affording the president. Given that the Posse Comitatus Act explicitly prohibits using the military for domestic policing, the Insurrection Act should be read narrowly. Courts must determine when, if ever, the Insurrection Act actually overrides Posse Comitatus. That\u2019s the lesson of the Supreme Court\u2019s Youngstown Steel decision: President Truman claimed emergency wartime authority to seize the steel mills, and the Court held that Congress had not authorized what he was doing. Wartime powers used domestically are very different from their use abroad, and courts must interpret them narrowly when the military is operating inside the United States. Pam Karlan: One of the striking developments lately is Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth\u2019s removal of the high-level Judge Advocate General lawyers within the military. How does that relate to what we\u2019ve been discussing? Bernadette Meyler: It\u2019s closely connected, because it reflects the same erosion of regularity and the rule of law within the military itself. In the district court opinion involving the Los Angeles National Guard deployment, the court went into great detail about how Guard members had been trained\u2014and how earlier training was reversed about what they were permitted to do, what counted as prohibited law-enforcement activity, and what did not. That reversal signaled a weakening of long-standing norms. Removing the JAG leadership undermines those norms as well. In military cases I\u2019ve read, even though the military operates within the executive branch, there\u2019s traditionally been a strong internal commitment to strict legality and to maintaining a disciplined system of military justice. Replacing or sidelining the personnel responsible for enforcing those standards makes the entire system more flexible in ways that undercut regularity. Pam Karlan: And that\u2019s especially troubling because, as you note, the military\u2014and certainly the National Guard\u2014is not trained for everyday law enforcement. What this reminded me of was a Supreme Court case from last term, Barnes v. Felix , about when police can use deadly force. The Court rejected the \u201cmoment of threat\u201d rule and said you have to look at whether the officer placed themselves in a situation where deadly force would become necessary. Police departments have even abandoned high-speed chases for similar reasons: the danger to bystanders is too great. My worry is that if the military is operating in American cities, they\u2019re simply not trained for those kinds of judgments. They\u2019re trained for lethality, while modern policing emphasizes community engagement and de-escalation. Combine aggressive ICE tactics with National Guard members who are unaccustomed to civilian policing\u2014and who may be nervous or improperly trained\u2014and the risks are enormous. We\u2019ve seen how that can end. Kent State remains a stark example. Pam Karlan: If a National Guardsman uses excessive force\u2014say, shoots someone without justification\u2014what happens next? What kind of accountability is there? Bernadette Meyler: That\u2019s a crucial question. There would likely need to be a separate judicial challenge to the Guard\u2019s deployment itself, but even then, the avenues for holding individual Guardsmen accountable are limited. They may have some form of immunity, even for conduct that violates civil rights. And on the criminal side\u2014whether through military justice or civilian prosecution\u2014we\u2019ve seen the rise of a much more aggressive \u201cunitary executive\u201d approach, with President Trump insisting on personally approving prosecutions and setting law-enforcement priorities. Given that posture, it\u2019s hard to imagine that someone who committed a violation in this context would actually be brought to justice under the current Justice Department. Pam Karlan: We\u2019re now waiting to see what the Supreme Court does in the Illinois case. Do you have a sense of where the Court may land? Bernadette Meyler: It\u2019s hard to predict. The key question will be how much deference the Court thinks the president is entitled to. The administration has argued for complete deference, relying on an early case called Martin, which I think is distinguishable. The Ninth Circuit took a middle ground\u2014some deference, but not total deference. The Seventh Circuit was similar, though slightly less deferential. The real issue is whether the Supreme Court will adopt one of three approaches: full deference to the president; an intermediate level of deference; or what I think is the correct approach\u2014having the judiciary decide the meaning of terms like \u201cinability to execute the laws\u201d or \u201crebellion,\u201d and then allowing the president to make determinations within those legal boundaries. I don\u2019t know which path the Court will ultimately choose. Pam Karlan: And the district judges who are granting stays at the outset are literally looking out their windows and saying, \u201cI don\u2019t see any of this happening.\u201d They\u2019re on the ground, they can assess the facts. But the Supreme Court\u2014far from Chicago or Los Angeles\u2014will be deciding on a thin record and effectively reaching the merits of whether the president can do this at all. Bernadette Meyler: Exactly. What struck me about the Ninth Circuit panel\u2019s decision was not just its significant deference to the president, but also its skepticism toward the district court\u2019s factual findings. That\u2019s unusual. Typically, appellate courts defer substantially to district courts on factual matters. Here, the hierarchy almost flipped, which is troubling in itself. Pam Karlan: Well, we should know soon what the Supreme Court thinks.

President Trump has been invoking this power in ways we haven\u2019t really seen since the civil-rights era. You\u2019ve been looking closely at this, including what\u2019s happening now in California and Illinois.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Bernadette Meyler:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Part of the backdrop here is the Supreme Court\u2019s recent presidential-immunity decision, which held that presidents are immune for their official acts. That ruling effectively gives Trump more room to exercise powers that might previously have been checked. There\u2019s also a connection to the pardon power: the National Guard is being used to support ICE and immigration-enforcement operations, and if civil rights violations occur in the process, those involved could potentially be pardoned by the president. Given how broadly the pardon power is understood today, that possibility looms large.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start with the operations themselves. In Illinois, we have \u201cOperation Midway Blitz,\u201d and there\u2019s a similar operation in Los Angeles. What were these initial ICE-led operations designed to do?</span></p>\n<p><b>Bernadette Meyler:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They were designed to ramp up immigration enforcement\u2014targeting people the administration considers to have violated immigration laws or to be unlawfully present in the country. Portland has seen similar activity. And the rhetoric around these operations makes clear they\u2019re aimed at Democratic-leaning cities viewed as \u201charboring\u201d undocumented immigrants. The enforcement has been very clearly targeted at those urban areas.</span></p>\n<p><a class=\"btn-filled btn-m\" href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/stanford-legal/national-guard-or-political-weapon/\">Listen to the Full Podcast</a></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And unlike past ICE raids\u2014say, at meat-packing plants\u2014these are happening right in the middle of cities where many residents, including citizens fully entitled to be here, strongly object. You have demonstrations, whistle-blowing networks, people warning communities about ICE activity. And you also have local police forces in these cities, right?</span></p>\n<p><b>Bernadette Meyler:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Exactly. In California, local police said they were fully capable of handling any issues that arose. There was some violence in Los Angeles, but LAPD reported they were managing it. Governor Newsom also made clear that the state did not need National Guard assistance. That\u2019s part of what makes the federal deployment so unusual. Generally, when the Guard is federalized, the governor consents. Here, President Trump deployed Guard units in Los Angeles without even notifying Governor Newsom.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though it\u2019s called the National Guard, it\u2019s usually under the command of each state\u2019s governor. Historically\u2014and this goes back to your work as a legal historian\u2014the Guard is the successor to the early state militias, which were meant to remain under local control rather than operate as a national standing army.</span></p>\n<p><b>Bernadette Meyler:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Exactly. The militias that became the National Guard were fundamentally local bodies. That\u2019s why the recent use of the Texas National Guard outside Texas is so striking. We\u2019ve seen Texas Guard units deployed to Illinois, and the administration has even threatened to send them into other states as well. That bypasses the ordinary respect for state sovereignty\u2014deploying forces into a state without consulting its governor. It also raises the very real concern of one state\u2019s militia being used against another, which historically would have been viewed as an invasion.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And now the president has federalized the Guard and is bringing in units from Texas, presumably because he doubts whether Guard members from Illinois will carry out the tasks he wants. Under the statute, though, the president can only do this if there\u2019s an invasion, a rebellion, or an inability to enforce federal law. Who gets to decide whether those conditions exist?</span></p>\n<p><b>Bernadette Meyler:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That question is at the center of the legal battles unfolding in both California and Illinois\u2014cases that have already reached the Supreme Court. The administration\u2019s position is that the president can federalize the Guard because he\u2019s \u201cunable to execute the laws\u201d with regular forces, pointing to alleged threats of violence against ICE officials in these locations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In California, a Ninth Circuit panel took a very deferential view. It held that the president\u2019s determination should stand so long as it reflects a \u201ccolorable assessment\u201d of the facts and falls within a \u201crange of honest judgment.\u201d What exactly that means is unclear\u2014and it gives the president considerable leeway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Seventh Circuit was also deferential, but not quite as deferential as the Ninth. It looked more closely at the statutory terms\u2014what counts as a \u201crebellion\u201d or an \u201cinability to execute the laws\u201d\u2014and suggested that courts still have a role in interpreting those thresholds. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, at this point, the circuit courts have granted the president some deference, but not total deference. And there\u2019s an ongoing debate about where that deference should lie: with the president\u2019s assessment of the facts on the ground, or with the courts\u2019 interpretation of the legal standards themselves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/stanford-legal/national-guard-or-political-weapon/\"><img alt=\"Stanford Legal Podcast\" class=\"alignright wp-image-452343 size-full\" height=\"1250\" src=\"https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/stanford-legal-podcast-3.png\" width=\"1250\" /></a></p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For generations, courts have relied on the \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d \u2014 the idea that the government acts in good faith and considers the right factors. How long can that presumption hold with this administration?</span></p>\n<p><b>Bernadette Meyler:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s a real concern. I\u2019d like to think we can retain the presumption of regularity, but it becomes hard when decisions aren\u2019t adequately explained or aren\u2019t consistent with historical practice. Even if the president were to articulate a broad view of what it means to be \u201cunable to execute the laws,\u201d that interpretation would be far outside what we\u2019ve seen over the past several centuries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this becomes a new norm, it raises the prospect of continuous National Guard deployment\u2014and, if the Insurrection Act is invoked, even broader use of the military across the country. We\u2019ve already seen proposals to have the Guard monitor elections in some places. So the presumption of regularity is under significant strain right now.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The idea of using the National Guard to monitor elections has been floated. Where does that even come from, legally or historically?</span></p>\n<p><b>Bernadette Meyler:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are very narrow historical situations where the Guard\u2014or the military\u2014was used domestically under the Insurrection Act. During the civil rights era, for example, the federal government deployed the military to enforce desegregation when states used armed resistance to prevent Black children from entering schools. If a state today tried to nullify an election, you could imagine a similar federal role to enforce federal law.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that goes directly to the trigger. If there\u2019s no evidence that federal election laws can\u2019t be enforced, there\u2019s no justification for using the National Guard. What such a deployment would do is intimidate voters\u2014an obvious benefit to those seeking to suppress turnout\u2014but without an inability to enforce federal law, there\u2019s no lawful basis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it\u2019s important to remember that federal law has long prohibited the military from interfering in elections. A statute that\u2019s been on the books for more than a century bars officers of the Army and Navy\u2014later amended to include the Air Force\u2014from participating in elections precisely because American law assumes the military is for fighting abroad, not policing voters at home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is also where the Posse Comitatus Act becomes crucial. Since 1878, it has prohibited the use of the military for domestic law enforcement unless Congress specifically authorizes it. That prohibition forms the backdrop for both the current deployment of the National Guard and the president\u2019s suggestions about invoking the Insurrection Act.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And we don\u2019t currently have any congressional authorization for using the military for domestic law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"I am a Journalist 39\" class=\"attachment-600x400 size-600x400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/i-am-a-journalist-55-750x500.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p><b>Bernadette Meyler: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly. The only statute that could authorize that is the Insurrection Act. It allows the president to use the militia or armed forces to enforce federal authority when there\u2019s a rebellion or when enforcing the laws has become \u201cimpracticable.\u201d And it has a built-in requirement: before invoking the Act, the president must issue a proclamation ordering people to disperse if they\u2019re believed to be engaged in an insurrection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even the administration doesn\u2019t seriously claim that what\u2019s happening now is an insurrection\u2014those arguments appear only as secondary defenses in court. Their primary claim is \u201cnecessity to enforce the laws,\u201d the idea that regular law enforcement isn\u2019t functioning properly. That brings us right back to who decides that question and the degree of deference courts are affording the president.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that the Posse Comitatus Act explicitly prohibits using the military for domestic policing, the Insurrection Act should be read narrowly. Courts must determine when, if ever, the Insurrection Act actually overrides Posse Comitatus. That\u2019s the lesson of the Supreme Court\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youngstown Steel</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> decision: President Truman claimed emergency wartime authority to seize the steel mills, and the Court held that Congress had not authorized what he was doing. Wartime powers used domestically are very different from their use abroad, and courts must interpret them narrowly when the military is operating inside the United States.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the striking developments lately is Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth\u2019s removal of the high-level Judge Advocate General lawyers within the military. How does that relate to what we\u2019ve been discussing?</span></p>\n<p><b>Bernadette Meyler:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s closely connected, because it reflects the same erosion of regularity and the rule of law within the military itself.

Cir. filed Dec. 2, 2025). The case involves patents asserted by Granite Vehicle Ventures LLC against Tesla's Self-Driving technology. But the petition's significance extends well beyond this particular dispute. Tesla advances a statutory interpretation argument that, if accepted, would fundamentally constrain the USPTO's claimed authority to deny IPR institution based on factors Congress never authorized. The core legal question is simple: Does 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 314(a) grant the Director unfettered discretion to invent new reasons to deny IPR institution? The USPTO has increasingly claimed discretionary power to justify denials based on a variety of novel explanations including \"time-to-trial\" concerns, \"settled expectations,\" and other criteria that do not appear in AIA or its legislative history.\u00a0 In its petition, Tesla argues the USPTO's approach transforms a provision limiting the Director's authority into an unlimited grant of power to nullify IPR entirely.

Like the days before, I had blocked time for writing the book \u201cBuilding Blocks of Machine Learning\u201d. But again, I spiralled into questioning the outline, the scope, and whether anyone would be interested in the book at all. One hour into writing, or rather doubting, a thought popped up: What if I just quit the project? A dangerous thought. Yet, sometimes, it\u2019s worth quitting. At this point, I\u2019ve probably accumulated  ~3 months full-time for the project (it hurts writing this \ud83e\udd72). Despite the sunk cost, the dangerous \u201cjust quit\u201d gave me an immediate sense of resolution. It felt \u2026 right. And so, I quit. When should you quit a project? I\u2019ve struggled with another book before. Modeling Mindsets was difficult to write. I struggled to find the right angle, the right level of technicality, the right scope. But I pulled through. And it was totally worth it. It\u2019s a book I am super proud of, and a lot of people enjoyed reading it. The Building Blocks book project has also seen many twists and turns. In its latest version, it was an alternative introduction to machine learning, focused more on the building blocks rather than the ML algorithms themselves. It\u2019s not unusual for a book project to evolve, but for this particular book, it has turned into \u201citerations of assumptions\u201d. Without much new information, I turned in circles, rearranging the chapters or changing the scope, only to be unhappy about the changes a week later. I failed to resolve my biggest doubts with the project over the last months: I assume you, like most of my readers, are way beyond your first steps in machine learning. So, writing an introduction to machine learning seems like an audience mismatch. I tried too hard to make the book original, come up with clever ideas, and, as a consequence, it became overly complex. When I tried to simplify it and weave a narrative through the building blocks, it converged towards the classic curriculum of machine learning. The world doesn\u2019t need yet another introduction to machine learning. The book aimed to be a bit of a \u201cTheory of Everything in ML,\u201d which was overly  ambitious. All these doubts played a role in quitting the book project. But in the end, it was a gut decision. I can\u2019t fully explain it. I can\u2019t fully explain why Modeling Mindsets seemed worth finishing, but Building Blocks doesn\u2019t. The book project had become a drain of energy, while Modeling Mindsets had been keeping me inspired. Postmortem analysis: what went wrong? I started the project 1.5 years ago. Weirdly enough, it started as a book project about bringing statistical rigor to machine learning. Over time, the project morphed more into \u201cdeconstructing\u201d machine learning algorithms. It was fun! I had time to think about the commonalities between many algorithms, but the project also became more abstract, and I couldn\u2019t find the right angle to turn these ideas into a coherent book. So I put the project aside for a year. In September 2025, I picked it up again, decided to invest more time into the book, really focus on it, and finish it quickly. Well, didn\u2019t work out \ud83d\ude02. In hindsight, the big problem was a lack of exchange and feedback. I iterated only on my own assumptions without talking to others. For all my other books, I had feedback loops: I published Interpretable Machine learning chapter by chapter, posted about it on Twitter, and got lots of feedback. For Modeling Mindsets, I had lots of friends and colleagues reading chapters. While writing the Conformal Prediction book, I published a post series on conformal prediction here on Mindful Modeler and had a lot of interactions. The SHAP book was straightforward:  I knew there was demand, and I already had lots of material. I involved beta readers early on. For the book Supervised Machine Learning for Science, I worked closely with my co-author Timo Freiesleben. But for Building Blocks of ML, I did very little in terms of exchange and feedback for a long time. This changed a bit later, and I started posting about the book here, but it was too little too late. What\u2019s next? I want to focus again on writing smaller pieces more frequently and actually publish them. Mostly Substack and social media (LinkedIn and Substack notes). Besides Mindful Modeler, I started a new substack called predict & pretend , which is about the role of prediction in our lives. I believe this publication could be interesting to you, but it felt right to separate predict & pretend from Mindful Modeler, which I overall want to keep more technical and centered around machine learning, with some exceptions like this post. sign up to predict & pretend For next week on Mindful Modeler, I plan to publish a big post with the interesting bits from the \u201cBuilding Blocks of Machine Learning\u201d book so the project can at least live for a random Tuesday in December. I was a bit hesitant to write about this failed project. But it was important for me to officially quit the project and not keep it on standby forever, silently draining my energy. Also, I\u2019m a fan of  personal \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d posts. We all show our polished results and our wins. The losses and failures? Much less so. That\u2019s why I find it helpful when others share the messy reality behind. So, hopefully, this post will resonate with some of you. I apologize to everyone waiting for the book and whom I might disappoint.",

REMARKS DELIVERED BY LEADER JEFFRIES: Thank you, Robin. Thanks to all the Members and certainly thankful for the panel of witnesses, Thomas, Carolina, Nicole and Brian for being here today. Thank you all for your advocacy and, of course, for sharing your stories about how the Trump administration policies are hurting everyday Americans and making it more difficult for people to make ends meet. We know that last year, Donald Trump and Republicans promised that they were going to lower costs on day one. And of course, costs haven\u2019t gone down, they\u2019ve gone up. This is day 319 of the Trump administration, and day 336 of complete Republican control of Congress. But what have we seen so far? Not a single piece of legislation, not a single plan, not even a single meaningful idea to drive down the high cost of living. Of course, in America, costs are going up. Inflation is up. Housing costs are up. Grocery prices are up. Electricity bills are skyrocketing. America is far too expensive. There are far too many people struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, as you have illustrated in such a compelling way. Through all of the chaos and cruelty and corruption that is being inflicted on the American people by House Republicans, the American people are being hurt, and these Republicans continue to make things worse. At the start of this year, Donald Trump froze critical funding for Head Start and left families and providers under duress. Two different federal courts forced the administration to uphold their responsibility to deliver nutritional benefits during the Trump-Republican shutdown. And yet, Republicans continued to try to weaponize the issue of hunger against the American people. And now the USDA is planning another effort to hold SNAP benefits hostage in states across the country. We, of course, are confronting a healthcare crisis, with Republicans refusing to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, notwithstanding the fact that they are going to expire at the end of this month, and tens of millions of Americans are going to experience dramatically increased premiums, co-pays and deductibles. In some instances, we know costs are going to increase on everyday Americans by $1,000 or $2,000 per month. This is all unsustainable. And yet, in this environment, the one thing that Republicans have done when they cut Medicaid in their One Big Ugly Bill, largest cut to Medicaid in American history, cut $186 billion in nutritional assistance from the American people, literally ripping food from the mouths of children, seniors, families and others. In that same piece of legislation, they did find the time to provide massive tax breaks to their billionaire donors and then make those tax breaks permanent. Yet can\u2019t even be bothered to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits for working class Americans. They\u2019re completely and totally out of control. This majority and Republican governance has been a failure for the American people. As we\u2019ve repeatedly stated, Democrats are willing to find common ground with anyone, anytime, anyplace as long as we\u2019re making life better for the American people, improving their quality of life and certainly focus on driving down the high cost of living and fixing our broken healthcare system. We just need serious partners on the other side of the aisle, and they\u2019re too busy fighting each other and rewarding their billionaire donors to do something meaningful for the American people. So we\u2019re thankful for your presence, for your compelling testimony, for your advocacy on behalf of the American people. And we look forward to our continued partnership on behalf of making life better for hardworking American taxpayers. Full remarks and hearing can be watched here. ###",

Looking ahead, the Call for Papers is open for AAPOR\u2019s 81st Annual Conference in LA, promising bold ideas and deep collaboration. Read the full letter to see how AAPOR is growing, innovating, and supporting our field through both exciting opportunities and ongoing challenges. Read the full message here Standards Updates Code Revision AAPOR\u2019s Standards Committee is revising the AAPOR Code this year and welcomes member input. Our bylaws require us to keep the Code of Professional Ethics up-to-date as the industry changes, and we are interested in your thoughts. While we can\u2019t guarantee your suggestions will appear in the final draft, all thoughtful and reasonable edits will help guide our work. Have ideas? Email ad hoc Code Review Subcommittee chair Ned English or Associate Standards Chair Krista Jenkins to share your suggestions and help shape the future of AAPOR\u2019s standards. Please send your feedback by the end of October. Membership will review and vote on the final proposed version next spring. New Guidance and Tools The AAPOR Standards Committee is pleased to share several new guidance documents and tools designed to help researchers navigate evolving methodological, operational, and ethical challenges in public opinion research. Each reflects our commitment to promoting high standards and transparency in the field. Many of these reports reflect several years of work, and we are grateful to past Standards chairs and members who advanced these efforts. Ethical Issues in Linking Non-Survey Data to Survey Data This document explores ethical considerations when linking survey data with administrative, commercial, or other non-survey data. It highlights the importance of protecting respondent privacy, maintaining informed consent, and ensuring data security. The guidance offers practical frameworks to help researchers make transparent, defensible decisions about data linkage while upholding AAPOR\u2019s ethical principles. Thank you to Josiane Bechara, Trent D. Buskirk, A. Rupa Datta, Ned English and an additional colleague for their work on this report. Texting for Research: A Brief Guide to the Regulatory Environment and Operational Considerations This new guide represents the culmination of extensive work by an AAPOR ad hoc subcommittee formed to examine the challenges researchers face when using text messaging for data collection. The group engaged directly with key industry stakeholders, \u00adincluding the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association (CTIA)-and submitted formal comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on behalf of AAPOR to advocate for research-friendly policies. Drawing on those conversations and their collective expertise, the subcommittee developed this guide to help researchers better understand the regulatory environment, navigate carrier restrictions, and apply best practices when using text messaging as a survey tool. We extend our gratitude to the members of the subcommittee for their leadership and collaboration: Neha Sahgal (Chair), Jennifer Benz, Kevin Collins, James Dayton, Ned English, Kate Hobson, Jennifer Hunter-Childs, Cameron McPhee, Brenna Muldavin, Angelique Uglow, and Andy Weiss. Estimating the Eligibility Status of Cases with Unknown Eligibility This new report complements the MPOR Standard Definitions (10th Edition) by providing updated guidance on how to estimate \u201ce,\u201d the proportion of cases with unknown eligibility that are likely to be eligible. It explains the most common calculation methods and offers advice on when each approach is appropriate. Building on earlier work (Smith, 2009), the report expands its scope to reflect today\u2019s more complex survey designs-such as multi\u00admode, multi-phase, and multi-frame studies-and aligns with the latest updates to AAPOR\u2019s Standard Definitions. Ashley Amaya led the revision, with contributions from Jenny Marlar and Ned English. Online Response Rate Calculator We are very excited to announce the launch of the online response rate calculator . The online calculator is an interactive tool that will ask a series of questions and use your responses to calculate response rates. Our hope is that this tool is more user friendly than the excel calculator and that it will be used by researchers and practitioners outside of MPOR. Please share with your colleagues and research partners. While the calculator has been tested for accuracy, it is an early version and future improvements may be made. If you encounter any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please contact standards@aapor.org. Ashley Amaya, Mickey Jackson and Jenny Marlar led the efforts to develop the calculator.
