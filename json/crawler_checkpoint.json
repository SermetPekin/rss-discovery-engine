You know that GAMLSS regression post we wrote? \ud83e\udde0 : Do you mean the monstrosity that took an entire month out of our lives, spawned an unhinged prequel post about the Box-Cox power exponential distribution and then another unhinged prequel post about B-splines and P-splines ? The one that brought us to tears several times and made us question our entire reason for being? The one that literally gave you nightmares? The accursed one, the post we swore we were finished with and would never ever revisit upon pain of death. Is that the post you mean? \ud83e\udec0 : Uh, yeah. \ud83e\udde0 : Oh yes, I remember it. What about it? \ud83e\udec0 : I, um\u2026 look\u2026 I think it, uhhhhh\u2026 needs a sequel post. We should talk about survey weights. I mean, I know it\u2019s not our job to talk about all the things, but it does sort of matter right? And we\u2019ve come so far with this thing, we should finish the job properly, right? I mean, I know we\u2019re not getting paid for this, but you do like to do a good job with things right? Just one more post? Please???? \ud83e\udde0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udde0 : Girl. Seriously though. What the actual fuck is wrong with you? The worst thing about being a scientist 1 is the fact that no matter how hard you work and no matter how diligent you are in learning skills that fall outside your core discipline, you will on a regular basis get slammed by outside context problems . You are trained to work within a particular framework, and you are exquisitely skilled at handling situations that fall within the scope of that framework. You are, almost by definition, a specialist . The days of the \u201crenaissance polymath\u201d are well and truly behind us, simply because science has advanced so far that no human mind can encompass the whole bloody thing at this point. It\u2019s impossible. This is of course a great triumph for science, but a terrible tragedy for the scientist who will always find themselves getting fucked over badly the moment \u201cthe thing I was trained for\u201d turns out to require knowledge from \u201cone of the million other things I was not trained for\u201d. The cruel reality of science is that we feel like fucking morons every single day because there are so very many traps, tripwires, and landmines strewn across the golden fields of science. We all fuck up. All the time. It\u2019s a core part of the job, actually. The trick, if you\u2019re a newly minted scientist hoping to survive in the badlands of real research, is to remain humble in the face complexity. When \u2013 not if \u2013 it happens to you, and you make a mistake, the thing you have to do own it and admit you were wrong. 2 Nobody with a shred of integrity will think less of you for admitting a mistake. And so it is in this spirit that I have to admit there\u2019s a mistake in my GAMLSS post . As of this exact moment of writing I don\u2019t know for certain how bad the mistake is because I haven\u2019t checked yet. 3 I have some reason to think my mistake isn\u2019t terrible , but I don\u2019t know for sure, and I\u2019m about to find out as soon as I write the rest of this post. Not gonna lie, I\u2019m a bit nervous. Survey weights The mistake I made in that post is one that experimentalists such as myself 4 are particularly prone to. I took data from a structured, stratified survey \u2013 in this case the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) \u2013 and analysed it as if it were a simple random sample, which it most certainly is not. In short, I forgot to consider survey weights. The mistake is embarrassing to me because the NHANES website has an entire study design tutorial that talks specifically about this issue 5 and like an idiot 6 I didn\u2019t take it into account. Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh. To understand the nature of my mistake, all you need to do is read the first paragraph of the NHANES tutorial discussing the design of the study: The NHANES samples are not simple random samples. Rather, a complex, multistage, probability sampling design is used to select participants representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population. Oversampling of certain population subgroups is also done to increase the reliability and precision of health status indicator estimates for these particular subgroups. Researchers need to take this into account in their analyses by appropriately specifying the sampling design parameters. Oh. Right. Yeah. Guess which bitch forgot to do that? Guess which bitch is now all of a sudden remembering that lots of surveys use stratified sampling, lot of surveys use oversampling for populations of interest, and lots of surveys discuss survey weights quite prominently on their websites 7 in the hope that researchers don\u2019t make the exact mistake that she did, in fact, make? That\u2019s right, this bitch. Oops. What do survey weights do? So let\u2019s start by thinking about what survey weights are supposed to do. Reduced to the simplest description I can think of, the idea is to introduce a correction factor that adjusts for whatever sampling biases are known to exist in the sample. Suppose, for example, an Australian survey were designed with an intentional 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. There might be reasons for doing this: the population of New South Wales is about 8,500,000 people, whereas Tasmania has only about 580,000 people or thereabouts. If we sampled Australians purely at random, our survey might not have enough Tasmanians in it to be able to say much about Tasmanian residents. Given the differences in population size, you\u2019d expect to see about 15 residents from New South Wales in the sample for every Tasmanian. That could be a problem if we have a need to understand state-by-state differences as well as understand the overall Australian population. Yes, we\u2019d be able to learn about Australia overall, but at the state level we\u2019d learn a lot more about New South Wales and Victoria than we would about Tasmania and South Australia. That\u2019s not ideal. Given this concern, then, we decide to adopt a 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. This means that any individual Tasmanian resident is 5x as likely to be included in the survey than any individual resident of New South Wales. We\u2019ll still end up with more people from New South Wales (because the actual population difference is 15x not 5x), but the final sample will now only have about 3x as many folks from New South Wales as from Tasmania. It\u2019s different, certainly, but we\u2019ll now be able to learn the things that we need to learn at the state-by-state level. The drawback to oversampling Tasmanians, however, is that the sample is now unrepresentative of the nation as a whole. If you want to construct estimates of some quantity for the whole nation, we have to give each NSW resident in the sample 5x the weight that we give to each Tasmanian, in order to correct for the Tasmanian oversampling. This correction factor is the survey weight , and it needs to be taken into account when analysing data from our survey. To be a little more precise about it, here\u2019s the description that the Australian Bureau of Statistics uses to describe survey weights as they apply to the Survey of Income and Housing: Weighting is the process of adjusting results from a sample survey to infer results for the total in scope population whether that be persons or households. To do this, a weight is allocated to each sample unit (e.g.\u00a0a person or a household). The weight is a value which indicates how many population units are represented by the sample unit. The first step in calculating weights for each unit is to assign an initial weight, which is the inverse of the probability of being selected in the survey. For example, if the probability of a household being selected in the survey was 1 in 600, then the household would have an initial weight of 600 (that is, it represents 600 households). Crudely put, the survey weight is a measure of \u201chow many individuals in the population does this sampled row represent?\u201d. In my hypothetical survey with Tasmanian oversampling, each surveyed person from NSW represents 5x as many Australians as each surveyed Tasmanian, and hence those data should weighted 5x as highly when making calculations about Australia as a whole. So now we return to my GAMLSS post and it\u2019s clearer why the models I developed weren\u2019t ideal: the NHANES data set contains survey weights (in a few different forms, actually) and I forgot to take them into account when fitting my models for population height and weight. In hindsight, it\u2019s obvious really. How bad was my mistake? So let\u2019s revisit my GAMLSS modelling for the NHANES data set. The nhanes data frame shown below is very similar to the one I used last time, with two substantial differences: I\u2019ve restricted it to the 10 year period 2009-2018 and added a survey_wt column that constructs the appropriate 10-year survey weight for these data: 8 Code for NHANES data import and preprocessing # directories post_dir <- rprojroot :: find_root_file ( criterion = rprojroot :: has_file ( \".here\" ) ) local_dir <- fs :: path (post_dir, \"nhanes\" ) data_dir <- fs :: path (local_dir, \"data\" ) output_dir <- fs :: path (local_dir, \"output\" ) # conversion based on NHANES average length_to_height <- function (length_cm) { length_cm - 1.06 } # all demographics and body measurement files for the 5 two-year cycles # spanning the decade from 2009 to 2018 demo_files <- fs :: dir_ls (fs :: path (data_dir, \"demo\" ), regexp = \"[FGHIJ] \\\\ .xpt\" ) bmx_files <- fs :: dir_ls (fs :: path (data_dir, \"bmx\" ), regexp = \"[FGHIJ] \\\\ .xpt\" ) # read demographics file (selected variables only) demos <- demo_files |> purrr :: map (\\(xx) { dd <- haven :: read_xpt (xx) if ( !

Noting this, let\u2019s fit a model for height by age, similar to what I did in my GAMLSS post. This time around I\u2019ll do it in two wats, one version using the weights and another version ignoring the weights. Here\u2019s what we get: Code for GAMLSS model fitting height_unweighted_file <- fs :: path (post_dir, \"nhanes\" , \"output\" , \"height_unweighted.rds\" ) height_weighted_file <- fs :: path (post_dir, \"nhanes\" , \"output\" , \"height_weighted.rds\" ) pb <- gamlss :: pb rerun <- FALSE if (rerun) { # unweighted model for height by age height_unweighted <- gamlss :: gamlss ( formula       = height_cm ~ pb (age_mn), sigma.formula = ~ pb (age_mn), nu.formula    = ~ 1 , tau.formula   = ~ 1 , data    = nhanes, family  = gamlss.dist :: BCPE ) # unweighted model for height by age height_weighted <- gamlss :: gamlss ( formula       = height_cm ~ pb (age_mn), sigma.formula = ~ pb (age_mn), nu.formula    = ~ 1 , tau.formula   = ~ 1 , data    = nhanes, weights = survey_wt, family  = gamlss.dist :: BCPE ) saveRDS (height_unweighted, file = height_unweighted_file) saveRDS (height_weighted, file = height_weighted_file) } else { height_unweighted <- readRDS ( file = height_unweighted_file) height_weighted <- readRDS ( file = height_weighted_file) } height_mod <- list ( unweighted = height_unweighted, weighted = height_weighted ) quartose :: quarto_tabset (height_mod, level = 3 ) unweighted weighted Family:  c(\"BCPE\", \"Box-Cox Power Exponential\")  \nFitting method: RS()  \n \nCall:   \ngamlss::gamlss(formula = height_cm ~ pb(age_mn), sigma.formula = ~pb(age_mn),   \n    nu.formula = ~1, tau.formula = ~1, family = gamlss.dist::BCPE,   \n    data = nhanes)  \n \nMu Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   pb(age_mn)   \n  111.12971      0.09179   \nSigma Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   pb(age_mn)   \n -3.0519544    0.0003807   \nNu Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   \n     0.3507   \nTau Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   \n     0.8091   \n \n Degrees of Freedom for the fit: 32.97 Residual Deg. of Freedom   45320  \nGlobal Deviance:     316144  \n            AIC:     316210  \n            SBC:     316498 Family:  c(\"BCPE\", \"Box-Cox Power Exponential\")  \nFitting method: RS()  \n \nCall:   \ngamlss::gamlss(formula = height_cm ~ pb(age_mn), sigma.formula = ~pb(age_mn),   \n    nu.formula = ~1, tau.formula = ~1, family = gamlss.dist::BCPE,   \n    data = nhanes, weights = survey_wt)  \n \nMu Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   pb(age_mn)   \n   126.1940       0.0694   \nSigma Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   pb(age_mn)   \n -3.0145454    0.0002932   \nNu Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   \n     0.4874   \nTau Coefficients: \n(Intercept)   \n     0.8769   \n \n Degrees of Freedom for the fit: 33.82 Residual Deg. of Freedom   45319  \nGlobal Deviance:     2137800000  \n            AIC:     2137800000  \n            SBC:     2137800000 Now let\u2019s draw the quantile curves that come out of both versions of the model fitting exercise. Thankfully for us, they look very, very similar: Code to compute and plot quantiles get_pars <- function (data, model) { pars <- tibble :: tibble ( mu    = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"mu\" ), sigma = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"sigma\" ), nu    = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"nu\" ), tau   = predict (model, newdata = data, type = \"response\" , what = \"tau\" ), ) dplyr :: bind_cols (data, pars) } age_max_yr <- 40 predict_cases <- tidyr :: expand_grid ( age_mn  = 1 : (age_max_yr * 12 ), weighted = c ( TRUE , FALSE ) ) predict_pars <- dplyr :: bind_rows ( predict_cases |> dplyr :: filter (weighted == TRUE ) |> dplyr :: select ( - weighted) |> get_pars (height_mod $ weighted) |> dplyr :: mutate ( model_type = \"weighted\" ), predict_cases |> dplyr :: filter (weighted == FALSE ) |> dplyr :: select ( - weighted) |> get_pars (height_mod $ unweighted) |> dplyr :: mutate ( model_type = \"unweighted\" ) ) predict_quantiles <- predict_pars |> dplyr :: mutate ( q05 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 05 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q25 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 25 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q50 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 50 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q75 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 75 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), q95 = gamlss.dist :: qBCPE (. 95 , mu = mu, sigma = sigma, nu = nu, tau = tau), age_yr = age_mn / 12 ) predict_quantiles_long <- predict_quantiles |> tidyr :: pivot_longer ( cols = dplyr :: starts_with ( \"q\" ), names_to = \"quantile\" , values_to = \"height_cm\" ) predict_quantiles_compare <- predict_quantiles_long |> dplyr :: select (age_mn, age_yr, height_cm, quantile, model_type) |> tidyr :: pivot_wider ( names_from = model_type, values_from = height_cm ) ggplot2 :: ggplot () + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( data = nhanes |> dplyr :: filter (age_yr < age_max_yr), mapping = ggplot2 :: aes (age_mn, height_cm), size = . 25 ) + ggplot2 :: geom_path ( data = predict_quantiles_long, mapping = ggplot2 :: aes (age_mn, height_cm, color = quantile) ) + ggplot2 :: facet_wrap ( ~ model_type) + ggplot2 :: theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) To illustrate the point slightly more precisely, the graphs below plot the quantiles estimated from the weighted model directly against those estimated by from the unweighted model. When drawn like this, the two models are indistinguishable: Code for the replotting predict_quantiles_compare |> ggplot2 :: ggplot ( mapping = ggplot2 :: aes ( x = unweighted, y = weighted, color = quantile ) ) + ggplot2 :: geom_abline ( intercept = 0 , slope = 1 ) + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( size = 3 , alpha = . 1 , show.legend = FALSE ) + ggplot2 :: facet_wrap ( ~ quantile) Well thank fuck. Now, this is not to say that the models are literally identical. There are systematic differences between the unweighted and weighted models, which show up the moment if we plot the differences between the two versions of the model on the y-axis, but the key thing here is to pay attention to the scale of the y-axis. Even for adults, where you might worry that systematic oversampling in NHANES might start to make a difference, the differences between the two models are never larger than a 2cm discrepancy: Code for the residuals plot predict_quantiles_compare |> ggplot2 :: ggplot ( mapping = ggplot2 :: aes ( x = age_yr, y = unweighted - weighted, color = quantile ) ) + ggplot2 :: geom_hline ( yintercept = 0 ) + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( size = 1 ) This makes clear that I did make a mistake \u2013 that part is still true \u2013 but thankfully the discrepancies between what the correctly weighted model predicts and what my original unweighted model predicts are pretty small. In the context of the analyses that I described in the original GAMLSS post and \u2013 much more importantly \u2013 the real world analyses in which I\u2019ve used an unweighted model when I should have used a weighted model, the scale of the discrepancy is so small that it won\u2019t affect any of the \u201cdownstream\u201d analyses. I\u2019m not going to have to send an emergency mea culpa to anyone. The conclusions of my analyses won\u2019t change. Again, thank fuck. Survey weights matter \ud83e\udde0 : So we\u2019re done now, right? You\u2019ve made your mea culpa, you\u2019ve outlined the reasons why the specific worry doesn\u2019t alter the inferences that would be made in the contexts we\u2019ve had to do this kind of work. Very diligent of us. Much proud. Very detail. Et cetera. We can stop now, yes? We\u2019ve done our duty admirably, thanks to your whining and panic. It can end now, yes? No more words need to be written? \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : Okay, about that\u2026 The truth is that I\u2019ve gotten lucky in my analyses, and so have all the other people who have used NHANES data the same way I have. 9 I forgot to take account of something that can matter, and I was fortunate enough that in my specific use cases it didn\u2019t matter. But the nature of luck is that you aren\u2019t always lucky. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. It is not too difficult to come up with examples where the survey weights really do matter, and the rest of the post will be devoted to a one such case. My example is a little artificial, but it will suffice. For the purposes of this example I\u2019m going to focus on the data from the 2015-2018 period, corresponding to the 2-year release cycles labelled \u201cI\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d in the data files. As described in the sample design report for this period, the oversampled subgroups during this period were: Hispanic persons; Non-Hispanic black persons; Non-Hispanic, non-black Asian persons; Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities at or below 185% of the federal poverty level; and Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities aged 0\u201311 years or 80 years and over. The language is oddly stilted, presumably because the authors of the report are being admirably cautious and have defined the groups using a set of non-overlapping categories. But if we were to be a little more informal, we\u2019d notice that these are the oversampled demographics: Hispanic people Black people Asian people Low-income people Young people Old people This makes sense for NHANES. I\u2019m not privvy to their decision making process but I think I can guess the logic: Hispanic, Black, and Asian demographics are oversampled for the same reason that Tasmanians are oversampled in my hypothetical survey at the beginning. They are minority demographics for which we might need to boost the sample size to allow group-by-group comparisons to work. In contrast, I suspect lower-income people, younger people, and older people are all oversampled because NHANES is primarily a survey about health and nutrition, and these three groups are at higher risk of concerns than the rest of the population. Noting all this, let\u2019s construct an example that deliberately exploits the structure of this oversampling in order to show why sample weights matter. One of the questions in the NHANES demographic survey asks about country of birth. The question is (on purpose, I suspect) quite coarse-grained. It just asks if you were born in the United States or not, that\u2019s it. Here\u2019s a version of the NHANES data that includes a column for us_born : Code for NHANES data import and preprocessing # demographics files of relevance demo_files <- fs :: dir_ls (fs :: path (data_dir, \"demo\" ), regexp = \"[IJ] \\\\ .xpt\" ) # read and process demographics file (selected variables only) nhanes_2 <- demo_files |> purrr :: map (\\(xx) { dd <- haven :: read_xpt (xx) dd <- dplyr :: select (dd, SEQN, RIAGENDR, RIDAGEYR, RIDEXAGM, DMDBORN4, WTINT2YR) dd }) |> dplyr :: bind_rows ( .id = \"file_demo\" ) |> dplyr :: mutate ( file_demo = fs :: path_file (file_demo)) |> dplyr :: select ( id          = SEQN, sex_s       = RIAGENDR, # sex/gender at screen (1 = M, 2 = F, . = NA) age_yr      = RIDAGEYR, # natal age at screening (years) survey_wt   = WTINT2YR, # 2-year weight for persons with interview data birth_cnt   = DMDBORN4, # country of birth (1 = US, 2 = other, all other codes NA) file_demo ) |> dplyr :: mutate ( sex_num = sex_s - 1 , # rescale to 0 = M, 1 = F sex_fct = factor (sex_s, levels = 1 : 2 , labels = c ( \"male\" , \"female\" )), us_born = dplyr :: case_when ( birth_cnt == 1 ~ TRUE , birth_cnt == 2 ~ FALSE , TRUE ~ NA ), survey_wt = survey_wt / 2 , # convert from 2-year to 4-year weight cohort = dplyr :: case_when ( file_demo == \"DEMO_I.xpt\" ~ \"2015-2016\" , file_demo == \"DEMO_J.xpt\" ~ \"2017-2018\" , TRUE ~ NA ) ) |> dplyr :: select ( id, sex_fct, age_yr, us_born, survey_wt ) |> dplyr :: filter (age_yr < 80 ) nhanes_2 # A tibble: 18,422 \u00d7 5\n      id sex_fct age_yr us_born survey_wt\n   <dbl> <fct>    <dbl> <lgl>       <dbl>\n 1 83732 male        62 TRUE       67336.\n 2 83733 male        53 FALSE      12164.\n 3 83734 male        78 TRUE        6200.\n 4 83735 female      56 TRUE       51359.\n 5 83736 female      42 TRUE        8814.\n 6 83737 female      72 FALSE       5626.\n 7 83738 female      11 TRUE        4982.\n 8 83739 male         4 TRUE       22375.\n 9 83740 male         1 TRUE        4946.\n10 83741 male        22 TRUE       18522.\n# \u2139 18,412 more rows Now, what I really ought to do here if I were being careful would be to also import variables corresponding to covariates of interest. I could, for example, include those variables that record race and ethnicity information for the NHANES participants. In this case that is especially important, because we know that oversampling is related to race and ethnicity, and we also know on the basis of commonsense that country of bith will also be related to race and ethnicity. 10 A well-constructed analysis of us_born as an outcome variable should include these as explicit covariates. However. I\u2019m not going to do that. I will, on purpose and with malice aforethought, omit critical variables of interest to the substantive problem. My version of the data set includes only two variables that we might use as predictors: age_yr and sex_fct . That\u2019s all you get. That, and the survey_wt variable that will turn out to be critically important because I dropped the other covariates! Noting that I\u2019ve done something malicious in the construction of the data set, let\u2019s move forward and look at what happens when we estimate the proportion of US residents who are also US born, stratified by age and sex. There are two versions of this calculation shown, one that uses the survey weights, and another that ignores them: birth_country <- nhanes_2 |> dplyr :: filter ( ! is.na (us_born)) |> dplyr :: summarise ( us_born_unweighted = mean (us_born), us_born_weighted = sum (us_born * survey_wt) / sum (survey_wt), .by = c (age_yr, sex_fct) ) |> dplyr :: arrange (age_yr) birth_country # A tibble: 160 \u00d7 4\n   age_yr sex_fct us_born_unweighted us_born_weighted\n    <dbl> <fct>                <dbl>            <dbl>\n 1      0 female               0.992            0.994\n 2      0 male                 1                1    \n 3      1 male                 0.982            0.979\n 4      1 female               0.984            0.987\n 5      2 female               0.978            0.982\n 6      2 male                 0.977            0.984\n 7      3 male                 0.951            0.956\n 8      3 female               0.977            0.984\n 9      4 male                 0.969            0.982\n10      4 female               0.976            0.982\n# \u2139 150 more rows Looking at the few rows of this table that you can see in this summary, it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much difference between the weighted and unweighted estimates. However, this is misleading because the only rows you can see here correspond to very young children, and all US-resident infants are also in fact US-born. So all the numbers are above 95% US-born. But once you start looking at every other age group, the story is going to change. And so without further ado, let\u2019s draw a plot\u2026 birth_country |> tidyr :: pivot_longer ( cols = c (us_born_unweighted, us_born_weighted), names_to = \"method\" , values_to = \"us_born\" , names_prefix = \"us_born_\" ) |> ggplot2 :: ggplot (ggplot2 :: aes ( x = age_yr, y = us_born, colour = method )) + ggplot2 :: geom_smooth ( method = \"loess\" , formula = y ~ x ) + ggplot2 :: geom_point ( size = 2 ) + ggplot2 :: facet_wrap ( ~ sex_fct) + ggplot2 :: theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) I\u2019ve used loess regression rather than gamlss regression because I honestly do not have the energy to fit more gamlss models, but you\u2019ll get roughly the same results with any flexible regression method. Looking at the plots, you can see that some aspects to the story remain the same no matter how you analyse the data: the proportion of overseas-born US residents is highest among people aged around 40 or thereabouts. Ingoring the sample weights (red curves) doesn\u2019t distort the correct answer (blue curves) in that respect, or at least not by very much. But that\u2019s about the only thing it doesn\u2019t distort. In every other respect the differences between the blue curves and the red curves are huuuuuuuuuge. The oversampling focuses on groups that are more likely to have been born outside the US, so inevitably it turns out that the sample weights make a huge difference. If you forget to look at the survey weights you\u2019d think that only 60% of middle-aged US residents were born in the US. Taking survey weights into account, however, we see that the correct answer is closer to 80%. That\u2026 yeah, that matters. In short \u2013 sometimes survey weights don\u2019t affect your results, but sometimes they really, really do. Epilogue \ud83e\udde0 : But seriously though, why did you make me do all this? I get that you always feel anxiety anytime you realise that there was some imperfection in something we\u2019ve done in the past, but it wasn\u2019t too hard to convince ourselves that the imperfection in question didn\u2019t affect anything of importance that we actually did. Doesn\u2019t this feel like overkill to you? \ud83e\udec0 : Maybe, I guess, but admit it\u2026 you feel better knowing that we investigated properly and documented the nature of our thinking in a way that might help other people who could also be tripped up the same way. You do, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you get a sense of joy and love from doing this? \ud83e\udde0 : Not really? You\u2019re the one with the heart emoji, babe. You\u2019re the touchy-feely one who wants so desperately to help people, and who panics disproportionately at even the smallest possibility of us having made a mistake. I\u2019m the one who actually has to do the reading and build the bloody models. This shit is exhausting. \ud83e\udec0 : Okay I get that, but also\u2026 isn\u2019t it possible that my anxiety is the thing that motivates us both to learn new things, and my need to help others is the thing that drives us to make the blog posts that people like so much? \ud83e\udde0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udde0 : I guess. But it\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting paid for this shit sweetie. We\u2019re doing this almost entirely out of the goodness of your heart, not mine. I\u2019d have preferred to spend my weekend on something else. We could have read a book, watched some TV, or\u2026 you know, lived our own lives. Doesn\u2019t that also seem worthy to you? Is anxiety and a desperate desire to be loved really a rational basis for choosing your behaviour? \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : Fair point but\u2026 would you really want to be one of those people who only does things for the love of money? Do want to be someone whose only real goal in life is to make number go up in the bank balance? \ud83e\udde0 : I\u2026 suppose not. But like\u2026 could you possibly just chill the fuck out sometimes? The anxiety is a bit over the top my dear, and it\u2019s not that pleasant to live with. \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : \u2026 \ud83e\udec0 : Maybe? Look, I\u2019ll try, okay? No promises. \ud83e\udde0 : Sigh. Resources For a post like this one, where I don\u2019t have strong expertise of my own and am writing it with the primary goal of improving my skills, I\u2019m a little wary about suggesting references for others. But for what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s some open access resources I relied on while writing this post: The NHANES study design tutorial provides a helpful overview of how to work with the sample weights that come supplied with the NHANES data. Along similar lines, I found it helpful to compare their notes with the weights page on the Australian Survey of Income and Housing website. There\u2019s a nice page on the Pew Research Center website containing notes by Andrew Mercer, Arnold Lau, and Courtney Kennedy on how different weighting methods work . If you read it on its own it\u2019s brief and helpful, is a nice entry point if you\u2019re an inveterate experimentalist at heart and survey data isn\u2019t your strength. Better yet, it\u2019s not a standalone document, it\u2019s acutally part of a much more comprehensive report on weighting online opt-in samples , so it gives you ample opportunity to branch out. One field in which I know these issues arise often is epidemiology, so it came as little surprise to me to discover that there is a useful chapter on survey analysis chapter contained within The Epidemiologist R Handbook . Another resource I found useful is this online book on how to weight a survey by Josep Espasa Reig. One nice thing about this one is that it\u2019s an informal walkthrough using examples in R, and it\u2019s intended to be readable by social scientists without any much expertise in the area. On the software side, here are a few tools I started investigating: the survey R package by Thomas Lumley, and the srvyr package that provides a dplyr -like syntax for it. In addition, after I shared this post on social media several people suggested additional reading material to look at. David Okunlola pointed me to this paper on subpopulation analysis Carl Pearson pointed me to some good discussion on statsexchange , and to another useful blog post on [different kinds of weights] by Thomas Lumley Samer Mouksassi pointed me to some work that he\u2019s done with longitudinal weights Brady West pointed me to this annual review article \u201cAre survey weights needed\u201d Ben Schneider mentioned Andrew Gelman\u2019s \u201cstruggles with survey weights\u201d paper and this reply . Stas Kolenikov very kindly shared a treasure trove of great links: Pfeffermann 1996 Binder and Roberts 2003 Heeringa, West, and Berglund A photo of what an NHANES MEC unit looks like So\u2026 I suppose I have more reading to do Footnotes Aside from, oh idk, just a lil hypothetical here, an authoritarian government gutting science funding, branding scientists as traitors for researching the wrong topics, threatening researchers, and gluing the cobblestones on the road to fascism in place using the blood and tears of those scientists that have the gall to care about human beings that aren\u2019t themselves.\u21a9\ufe0e I am currently giving very serious side eye at Uri Simonsohn in this regard. Stop being a dick, dude. You fucked up because you ventured outside your area of expertise, and you\u2019ve been gently corrected in the literature by people who know this stuff better than you do. And that\u2019s okay, as long as you stop doubling down on the mistake. Just a thought from a girl who no longer has skin in that particular game.\u21a9\ufe0e I suppose if you really want to check you can take a look at the git log on the blog repo and confirm that yep, I\u2019m writing this introductory section before writing any of the code to investigate the mistake. The anxiety is real.\u21a9\ufe0e I mean, it\u2019s now been about 5 years since the last time I actually ran an experiment of my very own. I\u2019m a data analyst by trade now, and unlike my old discipline of mathematical psychology where analysts tend to also run their own experiments, pharmacometricians tend not to conduct the studies they analyse themselves. Nevertheless, both disciplines are built atop a foundation of experimental science, and I notice that pharmacometricians tend to think in ways I find very familiar as a former math psych girl.\u21a9\ufe0e My sincere thanks to Benjamin Rich and Thomas Lumley who, in different contexts, both found very gentle ways to point me in the right direction. I mean, I did sort of know I had to think about this but I just\u2026 didn\u2019t.\u21a9\ufe0e In my defence, I was not an idiot. I was an analyst operating under time pressure, and I missed a detail that in hindsight I should have paid more attention to. Sigh. But it happens to us all, and in an attempt to practice what I preach, I\u2019m admitting it openly.\u21a9\ufe0e As another example, here\u2019s the Australian Survey of Income and Housing , and lo and behold it has a page explicitly discussing survey weights for the study.\u21a9\ufe0e You can inspect the code to see the actual calculations but in short, I used the \u201cMEC\u201d weights (weights associated with the data collected via the mobile examination centre) and - noting that the weights are commensurate over this period, constructed the 10-year weight by dividing the 2-year weight by 5 when the data for 5 2-year cycles are aggregated. The NHANES study design tutorial goes into details on this.\u21a9\ufe0e You know who you are. We\u2019ve all made this mistake once or twice \u263a\ufe0f. \u2019Tis the nature of the beast if you\u2019re working as an applied data analyst at the coalface. You get slammed with client requests that come in faster than you can handle, always with an externally-imposed deadline that you cannot change. You do the best you can in the limited timeframe that is permitted. That\u2019s all you can do.\u21a9\ufe0e Amusing side-note. It\u2019s always worth remembering that race and ethnicity categories aren\u2019t \u201cnatural categories\u201d in the sense that they map onto true and unyielding permanent categories in the world. When I work for Japanese clients, for example, their data set use race and ethnicity categories that are defined completely differently to how American clients define these things. Australian data sets define these things differently from American data sets also. The somewhat artificial nature of these categories means you should be careful when working with them in data sets, but also (and more entertainingly) lead to hilarious side effects. The formal definition of \u201cHispanic\u201d as used in a lot of US surveys is constructed around family ancestry, and usually around whether you or your parents were born in a Spanish-speaking country. Hilariously, to my mind, Spain is not excluded from the list of countries. So if your family comes from Spain (as mine does on one side) you are \u201ctechnically\u201d Hispanic, but not if your family comes from Portugal. Yes this is absurd. It means that the US considers me Hispanic. By any common sense understanding of what \u201cHispanic\u201d refers to, I am not Hispanic. But that is the nature of administrative categories: they are crude.\u21a9\ufe0e Reuse CC BY 4.0 Citation BibTeX citation: @online{navarro2025,\n  author = {Navarro, Danielle},\n  title = {Some Notes on Survey Weights},\n  date = {2025-09-27},\n  url = {https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/},\n  langid = {en}\n} For attribution, please cite this work as: Navarro, Danielle. 2025. \u201cSome Notes on Survey Weights.\u201d September 27, 2025. https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/ .",

What the actual fuck is wrong with you?</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p>The worst thing about being a scientist<sup>1</sup> is the fact that no matter how hard you work and no matter how diligent you are in learning skills that fall outside your core discipline, you will on a regular basis get slammed by <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem\">outside context problems</a>. You are trained to work within a particular framework, and you are exquisitely skilled at handling situations that fall within the scope of that framework. You are, almost by definition, a <em>specialist</em>. The days of the \u201crenaissance polymath\u201d are well and truly behind us, simply because science has advanced so far that no human mind can encompass the whole bloody thing at this point. It\u2019s impossible.</p>\n<p>This is of course a great triumph for science, but a terrible tragedy for the scientist who will <em>always</em> find themselves getting fucked over badly the moment \u201cthe thing I was trained for\u201d turns out to require knowledge from \u201cone of the million other things I was not trained for\u201d.

All the time. It\u2019s a core part of the job, actually. The trick, if you\u2019re a newly minted scientist hoping to survive in the badlands of real research, is to remain humble in the face complexity. When \u2013 not if \u2013 it happens to you, and you make a mistake, the thing you have to do own it and admit you were wrong.<sup>2</sup> Nobody with a shred of integrity will think less of you for admitting a mistake.</p>\n<p>And so it is in this spirit that I have to admit there\u2019s a mistake in my <a href=\"../../posts/2025-09-07_gamlss/\">GAMLSS post</a>. As of this exact moment of writing I don\u2019t know for certain how bad the mistake is because I haven\u2019t checked yet.<sup>3</sup> I have some reason to think my mistake isn\u2019t <em>terrible</em>, but I don\u2019t know for sure, and I\u2019m about to find out as soon as I write the rest of this post.</p>\n<p>Not gonna lie, I\u2019m a bit nervous.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"survey-weights\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">Survey weights</h2>\n<p>The mistake I made in that post is one that experimentalists such as myself<sup>4</sup> are particularly prone to. I took data from a structured, stratified survey \u2013 in this case the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/\">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a> (NHANES) \u2013 and analysed it as if it were a simple random sample, which it most certainly is not. In short, I forgot to consider <strong>survey weights.</strong> The mistake is embarrassing to me because the NHANES website has an entire <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/sampledesign.aspx\">study design tutorial</a> that talks specifically about this issue<sup>5</sup> and like an idiot<sup>6</sup> I didn\u2019t take it into account. Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.</p>\n<p>To understand the nature of my mistake, all you need to do is read the first paragraph of the NHANES tutorial discussing the design of the study:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>The NHANES samples are not simple random samples. Rather, a complex, multistage, probability sampling design is used to select participants representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population. Oversampling of certain population subgroups is also done to increase the reliability and precision of health status indicator estimates for these particular subgroups. Researchers need to take this into account in their analyses by appropriately specifying the sampling design parameters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh. Right. Yeah. Guess which bitch forgot to do that? Guess which bitch is now all of a sudden remembering that <em>lots</em> of surveys use stratified sampling, <em>lot</em> of surveys use oversampling for populations of interest, and <em>lots</em> of surveys discuss survey weights quite prominently on their websites<sup>7</sup> in the hope that researchers don\u2019t make the exact mistake that she did, in fact, make? That\u2019s right, this bitch.</p>\n<p>Oops.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"what-do-survey-weights-do\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">What do survey weights do?</h2>\n<p>So let\u2019s start by thinking about what survey weights are supposed to do. Reduced to the simplest description I can think of, the idea is to introduce a correction factor that adjusts for whatever sampling biases are known to exist in the sample. Suppose, for example, an Australian survey were designed with an intentional 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. There might be reasons for doing this: the population of New South Wales is about 8,500,000 people, whereas Tasmania has only about 580,000 people or thereabouts. If we sampled Australians purely at random, our survey might not have enough Tasmanians in it to be able to say much about Tasmanian residents. Given the differences in population size, you\u2019d expect to see about 15 residents from New South Wales in the sample for every Tasmanian. That could be a problem if we have a need to understand state-by-state differences as well as understand the overall Australian population. Yes, we\u2019d be able to learn about Australia overall, but at the state level we\u2019d learn a lot more about New South Wales and Victoria than we would about Tasmania and South Australia. That\u2019s not ideal.</p>\n<p>Given this concern, then, we decide to adopt a 5-fold oversampling of Tasmanians. This means that any <em>individual</em> Tasmanian resident is 5x as likely to be included in the survey than any individual resident of New South Wales. We\u2019ll still end up with more people from New South Wales (because the actual population difference is 15x not 5x), but the final sample will now only have about 3x as many folks from New South Wales as from Tasmania. It\u2019s different, certainly, but we\u2019ll now be able to learn the things that we need to learn at the state-by-state level.</p>\n<p>The drawback to oversampling Tasmanians, however, is that the sample is now unrepresentative of the nation as a whole. If you want to construct estimates of some quantity for the whole nation, we have to give each NSW resident in the sample 5x the weight that we give to each Tasmanian, in order to correct for the Tasmanian oversampling. This correction factor is the <strong>survey weight</strong>, and it needs to be taken into account when analysing data from our survey.</p>\n<p>To be a little more precise about it, here\u2019s the description that the Australian Bureau of Statistics uses to describe survey weights as they apply to the Survey of Income and Housing:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Weighting is the process of adjusting results from a sample survey to infer results for the total in scope population whether that be persons or households. To do this, a weight is allocated to each sample unit (e.g.&nbsp;a person or a household). The weight is a value which indicates how many population units are represented by the sample unit. The first step in calculating weights for each unit is to assign an initial weight, which is the inverse of the probability of being selected in the survey. For example, if the probability of a household being selected in the survey was 1 in 600, then the household would have an initial weight of 600 (that is, it represents 600 households).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Crudely put, the survey weight is a measure of \u201chow many individuals in the population does this sampled row represent?\u201d. In my hypothetical survey with Tasmanian oversampling, each surveyed person from NSW represents 5x as many Australians as each surveyed Tasmanian, and hence those data should weighted 5x as highly when making calculations about Australia as a whole.</p>\n<p>So now we return to my <a href=\"../../posts/2025-09-07_gamlss/\">GAMLSS post</a> and it\u2019s clearer why the models I developed weren\u2019t ideal: the NHANES data set contains survey weights (in a few different forms, actually) and I forgot to take them into account when fitting my models for population height and weight. In hindsight, it\u2019s obvious really.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"how-bad-was-my-mistake\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">How bad was my mistake?</h2>\n<p>So let\u2019s revisit my GAMLSS modelling for the NHANES data set. The <code>nhanes</code> data frame shown below is very similar to the one I used last time, with two substantial differences: I\u2019ve restricted it to the 10 year period 2009-2018 and added a <code>survey_wt</code> column that constructs the appropriate 10-year survey weight for these data:<sup>8</sup></p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<details class=\"code-fold\">\nCode for NHANES data import and preprocessing\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb1\" style=\"background: #f1f3f5;\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb1-1\"><span class=\"co\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E;

There <strong>are</strong> systematic differences between the unweighted and weighted models, which show up the moment if we plot the differences between the two versions of the model on the y-axis, but the key thing here is to pay attention to the scale of the y-axis. Even for adults, where you might worry that systematic oversampling in NHANES might start to make a difference, the differences between the two models are never larger than a 2cm discrepancy:</p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<details class=\"code-fold\">\nCode for the residuals plot\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb7\" style=\"background: #f1f3f5;\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb7-1\">predict_quantiles_compare <span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">|&gt;</span> </span>\n<span id=\"cb7-2\">  ggplot2<span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">::</span><span class=\"fu\" style=\"color: #4758AB; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">ggplot</span>(</span>\n<span id=\"cb7-3\">    <span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">mapping =</span> ggplot2<span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">::</span><span class=\"fu\" style=\"color: #4758AB; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">aes</span>(</span>\n<span id=\"cb7-4\">      <span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">x =</span> age_yr,</span>\n<span id=\"cb7-5\">      <span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">y =</span> unweighted <span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">-</span> weighted, </span>\n<span id=\"cb7-6\">      <span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">color =</span> quantile</span>\n<span id=\"cb7-7\">    )</span>\n<span id=\"cb7-8\">  ) <span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">+</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb7-9\">  ggplot2<span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">::</span><span class=\"fu\" style=\"color: #4758AB; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">geom_hline</span>(<span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">yintercept =</span> <span class=\"dv\" style=\"color: #AD0000; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">0</span>) <span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">+</span> </span>\n<span id=\"cb7-10\">  ggplot2<span class=\"sc\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">::</span><span class=\"fu\" style=\"color: #4758AB; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">geom_point</span>(<span class=\"at\" style=\"color: #657422; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">size =</span> <span class=\"dv\" style=\"color: #AD0000; background-color: null; font-style: inherit;\">1</span>) </span></code></pre></div>\n</details>\n<div class=\"cell-output-display\">\n<div>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid figure-img\" src=\"https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/index_files/figure-html/predict-quantiles-residuals-age-1.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>This makes clear that I did make a mistake \u2013 that part is still true \u2013 but thankfully the discrepancies between what the correctly weighted model predicts and what my original unweighted model predicts are pretty small.

Very diligent of us. Much proud. Very detail. Et cetera. We can stop now, yes? We\u2019ve done our duty admirably, thanks to your whining and panic. It can end now, yes? No more words need to be written?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : \u2026<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Okay, about that\u2026<br /></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p>The truth is that I\u2019ve gotten lucky in my analyses, and so have all the other people who have used NHANES data the same way I have.<sup>9</sup> I forgot to take account of something that can matter, and I was fortunate enough that in my specific use cases it didn\u2019t matter. But the nature of luck is that you aren\u2019t always lucky. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. It is not too difficult to come up with examples where the survey weights really do matter, and the rest of the post will be devoted to a one such case. My example is a little artificial, but it will suffice.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this example I\u2019m going to focus on the data from the 2015-2018 period, corresponding to the 2-year release cycles labelled \u201cI\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d in the data files. As described in the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02-184-508.pdf\">sample design report</a> for this period, the oversampled subgroups during this period were:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<ul>\n<li>Hispanic persons;</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic black persons;</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic, non-black Asian persons;</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities at or below 185% of the federal poverty level; and</li>\n<li>Non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and ethnicities aged 0\u201311 years or 80 years and over.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The language is oddly stilted, presumably because the authors of the report are being admirably cautious and have defined the groups using a set of non-overlapping categories. But if we were to be a little more informal, we\u2019d notice that these are the oversampled demographics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hispanic people</li>\n<li>Black people</li>\n<li>Asian people</li>\n<li>Low-income people</li>\n<li>Young people</li>\n<li>Old people</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This makes sense for NHANES. I\u2019m not privvy to their decision making process but I think I can guess the logic: Hispanic, Black, and Asian demographics are oversampled for the same reason that Tasmanians are oversampled in my hypothetical survey at the beginning. They are minority demographics for which we might need to boost the sample size to allow group-by-group comparisons to work. In contrast, I suspect lower-income people, younger people, and older people are all oversampled because NHANES is primarily a survey about health and nutrition, and these three groups are at higher risk of concerns than the rest of the population.</p>\n<p>Noting all this, let\u2019s construct an example that deliberately exploits the structure of this oversampling in order to show why sample weights matter. One of the questions in the NHANES demographic survey asks about country of birth. The question is (on purpose, I suspect) quite coarse-grained. It just asks if you were born in the United States or not, that\u2019s it. Here\u2019s a version of the NHANES data that includes a column for <code>us_born</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<details class=\"code-fold\">\nCode for NHANES data import and preprocessing\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb8\" style=\"background: #f1f3f5;\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb8-1\"><span class=\"co\" style=\"color: #5E5E5E;

In this case that is <em>especially</em> important, because we know that oversampling is related to race and ethnicity, and we also know on the basis of commonsense that country of bith will also be related to race and ethnicity.<sup>10</sup> A well-constructed analysis of <code>us_born</code> as an outcome variable should include these as explicit covariates.</p>\n<p>However.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to do that.

Ingoring the sample weights (red curves) doesn\u2019t distort the correct answer (blue curves) in that respect, or at least not by very much. But that\u2019s about the only thing it doesn\u2019t distort. In every other respect the differences between the blue curves and the red curves are huuuuuuuuuge. The oversampling focuses on groups that are more likely to have been born outside the US, so inevitably it turns out that the sample weights make a huge difference. If you forget to look at the survey weights you\u2019d think that only 60% of middle-aged US residents were born in the US. Taking survey weights into account, however, we see that the correct answer is closer to 80%. That\u2026 yeah, that matters.</p>\n<p>In short \u2013 sometimes survey weights don\u2019t affect your results, but sometimes they really, really do.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"epilogue\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">Epilogue</h2>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : But seriously though, why did you make me do all this?

Doesn\u2019t this feel like overkill to you?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Maybe, I guess, but admit it\u2026 you feel better knowing that we investigated properly and documented the nature of our thinking in a way that might help other people who could also be tripped up the same way.

This shit is exhausting.<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udec0 : Okay I get that, but also\u2026 isn\u2019t it possible that my anxiety is the thing that motivates us both to learn new things, and my need to help others is the thing that drives us to make the blog posts that people like so much?<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : \u2026<br /></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 : I guess.

I\u2019d have preferred to spend my weekend on something else. We could have read a book, watched some TV, or\u2026 you know, lived our own lives. Doesn\u2019t that also seem worthy to you?

If you read it on its own it\u2019s brief and helpful, is a nice entry point if you\u2019re an inveterate experimentalist at heart and survey data isn\u2019t your strength.

Stop being a dick, dude. You fucked up because you ventured outside your area of expertise, and you\u2019ve been gently corrected in the literature by people who know this stuff better than you do. And that\u2019s okay, as long as you stop doubling down on the mistake. Just a thought from a girl who no longer has skin in that particular game.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn3\"><p>I suppose if you really want to check you can take a look at the git log on the blog repo and confirm that yep, I\u2019m writing this introductory section <em>before</em> writing any of the code to investigate the mistake. The anxiety is real.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn4\"><p>I mean, it\u2019s now been about 5 years since the last time I actually <em>ran</em> an experiment of my very own. I\u2019m a data analyst by trade now, and unlike my old discipline of mathematical psychology where analysts tend to also run their own experiments, pharmacometricians tend not to conduct the studies they analyse themselves. Nevertheless, both disciplines are built atop a foundation of experimental science, and I notice that pharmacometricians tend to think in ways I find very familiar as a former math psych girl.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn5\"><p>My sincere thanks to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminrichphd/\">Benjamin Rich</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-lumley\">Thomas Lumley</a> who, in different contexts, both found very gentle ways to point me in the right direction. I mean, I did sort of know I had to think about this but I just\u2026 didn\u2019t.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn6\"><p>In my defence, I was not an idiot. I was an analyst operating under time pressure, and I missed a detail that in hindsight I should have paid more attention to. Sigh. But it happens to us all, and in an attempt to practice what I preach, I\u2019m admitting it openly.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn7\"><p>As another example, here\u2019s the Australian <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/concepts-sources-methods/survey-income-and-housing-user-guide-australia/2019-20\">Survey of Income and Housing</a>, and lo and behold it has a page explicitly discussing <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/concepts-sources-methods/survey-income-and-housing-user-guide-australia/2019-20/weights\">survey weights</a> for the study.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn8\"><p>You can inspect the code to see the actual calculations but in short, I used the \u201cMEC\u201d weights (weights associated with the data collected via the mobile examination centre) and - noting that the weights are commensurate over this period, constructed the 10-year weight by dividing the 2-year weight by 5 when the data for 5 2-year cycles are aggregated. The <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/sampledesign.aspx\">NHANES study design tutorial</a> goes into details on this.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn9\"><p>You know who you are. We\u2019ve all made this mistake once or twice \u263a\ufe0f. \u2019Tis the nature of the beast if you\u2019re working as an applied data analyst at the coalface. You get slammed with client requests that come in faster than you can handle, always with an externally-imposed deadline that you cannot change. You do the best you can in the limited timeframe that is permitted. That\u2019s all you can do.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n<li id=\"fn10\"><p>Amusing side-note. It\u2019s always worth remembering that race and ethnicity categories aren\u2019t \u201cnatural categories\u201d in the sense that they map onto true and unyielding permanent categories in the world. When I work for Japanese clients, for example, their data set use race and ethnicity categories that are defined completely differently to how American clients define these things. Australian data sets define these things differently from American data sets also. The somewhat artificial nature of these categories means you should be careful when working with them in data sets, but also (and more entertainingly) lead to hilarious side effects. The formal definition of \u201cHispanic\u201d as used in a lot of US surveys is constructed around family ancestry, and usually around whether you or your parents were born in a Spanish-speaking country. Hilariously, to my mind, Spain is <em>not</em> excluded from the list of countries. So if your family comes from Spain (as mine does on one side) you are \u201ctechnically\u201d Hispanic, but not if your family comes from Portugal. Yes this is absurd. It means that the US considers me Hispanic. By any common sense understanding of what \u201cHispanic\u201d refers to, I am not Hispanic. But that is the nature of administrative categories: they are crude.\u21a9\ufe0e</p></li>\n</ol>\n</section><section class=\"quarto-appendix-contents\" id=\"quarto-reuse\"><h2 class=\"anchored quarto-appendix-heading\">Reuse</h2><div class=\"quarto-appendix-contents\"><div><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" rel=\"license\">CC BY 4.0</a></div></div></section><section class=\"quarto-appendix-contents\" id=\"quarto-citation\"><h2 class=\"anchored quarto-appendix-heading\">Citation</h2><div><div class=\"quarto-appendix-secondary-label\">BibTeX citation:</div><pre class=\"sourceCode code-with-copy quarto-appendix-bibtex\"><code class=\"sourceCode bibtex\">@online{navarro2025,\n  author = {Navarro, Danielle},\n  title = {Some Notes on Survey Weights},\n  date = {2025-09-27},\n  url = {https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\n</code></pre><div class=\"quarto-appendix-secondary-label\">For attribution, please cite this work as:</div><div class=\"csl-entry quarto-appendix-citeas\" id=\"ref-navarro2025\">\nNavarro, Danielle. 2025. <span>\u201cSome Notes on Survey Weights.\u201d</span>\nSeptember 27, 2025. <a href=\"https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/\">https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-09-27_survey-weights/</a>.\n</div></div></section></div>"

The package allows R users to leverage the power of scikit-learn models directly from R, using both S3 and R6 object-oriented programming styles.

Another advantage here, is that I know exactly what is installed in the environment, making it easier to debug potential issues. 1.

Shortcomings of the 1918 vaccine trials spurred statistical research on designing vaccine studies that ultimately led to the rigorous designs used today. Another statistical issue that hindered response to the 1918 pandemic was the lack of accurate, timely statistics about influenza cases and deaths. Some cities and states attempted to keep statistics of deaths, but only 33 states participated in the US Vital Statistics system. Vital statistics are exactly what the name implies: statistics related to life events. These typically include statistics about births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. In 1918, death statistics were needed to know the extent of fatalities caused by the influenza pandemic. Let\u2019s look at the death statistics available in 1918 and how they led to today\u2019s Vital Statistics systems. Vital Statistics in 1918 Schedule 3 of the 1850 census asked for a list all of the persons in the family who had died in 1850, along with their age, sex, color, occupation, and cause of death. This marked the first time the US government attempted to collect mortality statistics for all states, but the \u201creports were inaccurate and incomplete, and it became evident that reliable data could be obtained only from States and large cities that had efficient systems for the registration of these events\u201d (Hetzel, 1997, p. 9). The Bureau of the Census established a \u201cnational registration area\u201d for deaths in 1880. At first the registration area contained only two states (Massachusetts and New Jersey), but more states were admitted as they met the requirements of (1) adopting the standard death certificate, (2) enacting a Model State Vital Statistics law that specified registration procedures and duties of state registrars, and (3) establishing that at least 90 percent of deaths were captured by the system. In 1918, 33 of the 48 states, accounting for approximately 3/4 of the US population, had been admitted to the national registration area for deaths (see Figure 1). Figure 1. States in national death registration area, 1918. Dates of entry are from Dunn (1936) But wait a minute. A state could easily establish that it had enacted the model law and adopted the standard death certificate, but how could it verify that its registration system captured at least 90 percent of deaths? The registrar was supposed to record all known deaths. How could he \u00b9 know about deaths that were unrecorded by the system? Davis (1925, p. 399) wrote that a version of capture-recapture estimation was used: \u201cby obtaining from postmasters, rural carriers, and the clergy names of decedents in certain specified months. These names were then checked against the names on file in the official records of the state. If 90 per cent of the names thus gathered from the rural carriers and others were found on file the state was admitted to the area.\u201d But then state vital registration systems started relying on additional data from postmasters, rural carriers, and the clergy so that their information would be captured in the death statistics system (and could no longer be used to check its accuracy). In the mid-1920s, the Bureau of the Census switched to another method of estimating the percentage of state deaths captured by the registration system. They sent return-postage-paid postcards directly to households, asking the respondent to fill in the name and death date of anyone in the household who had died in the last 12 months. Both of these methods would likely underestimate the percentage of deaths captured by the vital registration system. Wilbur (1916) admitted that \u201cEven for the registration area for deaths as at present constituted, we do not have full assurance that the registration is uniformly complete in all states. The standard of admission is low\u201490 per cent\u2014and the means of testing the compliance therewith are inadequate.\u201d Davis (1925) commented on the unusually low death rates in several of the recently admitted southern states. It is quite likely that some states in the death registration areas were missing more than 10 percent of their deaths. The influenza pandemic, however, highlighted the inadequacy of the available statistics and spurred research on their improvement. Dunn (1936, p. 349) commented that the \u201cneed for new methods of testing completeness of registration is one of the most vital problems confronting the vital statistician.\u201d \u00b2 Vital Statistics Today By 1933, all 48 states had qualified to be part of the national death registration area. Compiling statistics was slow, however, because all records were on paper, and death statistics were typically released with a two-year time lag. In the early 2000s, the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) began switching over to electronic systems . The National Center for Health Statistics (2021) reported on some of the improvements to the NVSS resulting from data modernization efforts, including improved data quality and more complete information on causes of death. The final reports on mortality still have a nearly two-year lag, however. Provisional statistics are available earlier, but the NVSS modernization goal of \u201ca tool for real-time public health surveillance\u201d. The most recent provisional death statistics are from fourth quarter, 2024 for deaths from all causes and from third quarter, 2024 for deaths from specific causes such as homicide \u2014 almost a year after the last events of 2024. Vital statistics are integrated into so many processes and assessments of the nation\u2019s health that they are often taken for granted (National Research Council 2009, p. 3). The NVSS cooperation between local, state, and federal governments took decades to develop, however. The NVSS modernization program requires resources and continued cooperation and trust to achieve its goal \u201cto transform the National Vital Statistics System into a tool for real-time public health surveillance.\u201d Footnotes and References \u00b9I use the pronoun \u201che\u201d because official state registrars were men, but in several states women collected the statistics. When Arizona was admitted into the death registration area in 1926, the statistician who collected and tallied the death statistics was a woman named Ruby Jacquemin. \u00b2Halbert Dunn was the Chief of the Vital Statistics Office from 1935 to 1960. His most famous contribution to statistics, however was in another area. Dunn (1946) wrote that each person has a Book of Life but sometimes the Book is difficult to read because records are recorded in different places.

        "full_content": "The Target statement recently appeared in JAMA 1 , and I hereby confer it with two acronym-related awards: \u201cMost dubious\u201d and possibly \u201cLongest gap between two successive letters in the acronym\u201d 2 . The whole idea of target trial emulation is clever and useful. The cleverness is as a communication tool: It helps avoid certain ambiguities by describing what researchers would have liked to do (and why), what was done, and the discrepancy between the two. This facilitates shared understanding and helps with critical appraisal. In that sense, target trial emulation was crying out for a reporting guideline. People who do target trials often testify that it clarifies their thinking about design (often the time zero stuff gets emphasised), and the Target statement in particular provides a structure that avoids missing certain blind-spots in reporting. As with most reporting guidelines, it is nominally about reporting, but sometimes \u2013 usefully, IMO \u2013 hints at what people should have done rather than how they report it. Personally, as someone whose bread-and-butter is randomised clinical trials, I find it helpful to understand what researchers would do if they could, deficiencies in the available data, and so on. I also like the emphasis on identifying assumptions. Despite the above praise, I will register two gripes. One is about what I see done; the other is about the Target statement itself. Gripe 1: Actual trials may not be target trials but describing a target trial does require good understanding of actual trials Target trial emulation is IMO particularly useful for communication with actual 3 trials people. The flip-side is that, to talk about a target trial, one must understand actual trials! In many descriptions of a \u201ctarget trial\u201d I see, there is huge ambiguity. I suspect this is because many people doing target trial emulation don\u2019t really know much about actual trials. One example is outcomes 4 . In actual trials, a lot of deliberation goes into outcome definition, measurement, review, and so on 5 . This seems to be treated fairly superficially in target trial emulation (see for example items 6e and 12 in the Target statement). In a sense this is understandable: you have what you have; different sites might be using different definitions; you might not really know the measurement protocol; etc. But of course, actual trials have these in-depth discussions because it matters, so highlighting discrepancies is important. It\u2019s exactly like the \u201ctime zero\u201d thing, but for some reason does not receive much emphasis. Gripe 2: Target statement leaves causal estimands translucent-to-opaque Defining a target trial helps to know what people would like to do. It\u2019s procedural. Some of its advocates claim that knowing this tells us exactly what people want to learn (the estimand). Nope. An estimand is a natural-language description of the effect we wish to learn about. For methodological work, this is often compressed into the mathematical notation of potential outcomes because it\u2019s useful for identification purposes (imagine writing out words every time instead of Y \u00b9 or Y (1)  whatever you write). Once we have a study design, we can work towards finding an identifying expression in terms of observable quantities (some people call this the \u201cstatistical estimand\u201d, which is [i] reasonable and [ii] confusing; net-bad). I think the idea in target trials is that the identifying expression should be trivially simple, like a simple comparison of means or whatever. That\u2019s fine, but trivially-simple identification still does not tell us what causal estimand is identifies. Something statisticians used to do all the time in actual trials \u2013 no doubt some still do \u2013 was to censor data after an intercurrent event, then analyse the ITT set (e.g. a Cox model for censored time-to-event outcomes, or a mixed model for quantitative outcomes). Amazingly, this was sometimes accompanied by a statement that the trial tests the effects of randomisation (implying treatment policy). This was not right; those censoring and estimation procedures targeted what we would now term a hypothetical strategy. The point is, there is often a discrepancy between what people claim they want (the estimand) and what they actually do (analysis approach). Saying what they want does not resolve the discrepancy, but without it we would not even know that there is one. They might think they are estimating one thing, you might assume something else. The point is, describing your target trial is great, but even that does not tell us the estimand. Also, given Hern\u00e1n\u2019s semantic quibbles (mostly wrong) about E9(R1) Addendum-style estimands 6 at EFSPI workshop , I\u2019m going to hit back and highlight a paragraph I\u2019ve been referred to several times in the past 7 , held up each time as the way to precisely define a \u201ccausal contrast\u201d. Read what you will into this picture of my boy a few years ago (noticing where the arrow is, and the boar). Disclaimer The above are observations from listening to quite a lot of presentations about target trial emulation, but I\u2019m certainly no expert. I want to re-emphasise that it can be a great communication tool and I will often jump to defend it.

Using big data to emulate a target trial when a randomized trial is not available. American Journal of Epidemiology . 2016; 183(8):758\u2013764. doi:10.1093/aje/kwv254",
        "raw_html": "<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.13350\">Target statement</a> recently appeared in JAMA<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a>, and I hereby confer it with two acronym-related awards: &#8220;Most dubious&#8221; and possibly &#8220;Longest gap between two successive letters in the acronym&#8221;<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a>.</p><p>The whole idea of target trial emulation is clever and useful. The cleverness is as a communication tool: It helps avoid certain ambiguities by describing what researchers would have liked to do (and why), what was done, and the discrepancy between the two. This facilitates shared understanding and helps with critical appraisal. In that sense, target trial emulation was crying out for a reporting guideline.</p><p>People who do target trials often testify that it clarifies their thinking about design (often the time zero stuff gets emphasised), and the Target statement in particular provides a structure that avoids missing certain blind-spots in reporting. As with most reporting guidelines, it is <em>nominally</em> about reporting, but sometimes &#8211; usefully, IMO &#8211; hints at what people should have done rather than how they report it.</p><p>Personally, as someone whose bread-and-butter is randomised clinical trials, I find it helpful to understand what researchers would do if they could, deficiencies in the available data, and so on. I also like the emphasis on identifying assumptions.</p><p>Despite the above praise, I will register two gripes. One is about what I see done; the other is about the Target statement itself.</p><h1>Gripe 1: Actual trials may not be target trials but describing a target trial does require good understanding of actual trials</h1><p>Target trial emulation is IMO particularly useful for communication with actual<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> trials people. The flip-side is that, to talk about a target trial, one must understand actual trials! In many descriptions of a &#8220;target trial&#8221; I see, there is <em>huge</em> ambiguity. I suspect this is because many people doing target trial emulation don&#8217;t really know much about actual trials.</p><p>One example is outcomes<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a>. In actual trials, a lot of deliberation goes into outcome definition, measurement, review, and so on<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a>. This seems to be treated fairly superficially in target trial emulation (see for example items 6e and 12 in the Target statement). In a sense this is understandable: you have what you have; different sites might be using different definitions; you might not really know the measurement protocol; etc. But of course, actual trials have these in-depth discussions because it matters, so highlighting discrepancies is important. It&#8217;s exactly like the &#8220;time zero&#8221; thing, but for some reason does not receive much emphasis.</p><h1>Gripe 2: Target statement leaves causal estimands translucent-to-opaque</h1><p>Defining a target trial helps to know what people would like to do. It&#8217;s procedural. Some of its advocates claim that knowing this tells us exactly what people want to learn (the estimand). Nope.</p><p>An estimand is a natural-language description of the effect we wish to learn about. For methodological work, this is often compressed into the mathematical notation of potential outcomes because it&#8217;s useful for identification purposes (imagine writing out words every time instead of <em>Y</em>&#185; or <em>Y</em>(1)  whatever you write). Once we have a study design, we can work towards finding an identifying expression in terms of observable quantities (some people call this the &#8220;statistical estimand&#8221;, which is [i] reasonable and [ii] confusing; net-bad). I think the idea in target trials is that the identifying expression should be trivially simple, like a simple comparison of means or whatever.

A more accurate chronometer would have been too expensive and too fragile to carry on the voyage.</p>\n<p>For more on calculating longitude, see Dava Sobel&#8217;s book <em>Longitude</em>.</p>\n<h2>Related posts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/03/07/duttons/\">Dutton\u2019s Navigation and Piloting</a></li>\n<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/08/17/tracking-euler/\">Tracking and the Euler rotation theorem</a></li>\n<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/11/04/little-coffee-on-the-prairie/\">A little coffee on the prairie</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1] At least 17 years ago.

One of the key components of such an application is voice-to-text software. There are many nuances that trip up such software. One puzzle is homophones: since John and Jon are pronounced the same, how can the \"smart\" device decide which one was spoken? Humans encounter the same problem. We make the intention clear by saying \"John with the h\" or \"Jon without the h\". How does this issue arise with Chinese names? My friend Ray V. sent me to a nice data visualization project by Liuhuaying Yang tackling this tricky subject. The situation with Chinese names is even more complex. Chinese names are made up of ordered characters (typically one, possibly two, characters for the surname, and typically one or two, possibly three, characters for the \"given name\"). The surname is written before the given name. Each character is a single syllable. Homophones are numerous. The designer illustrates this as a tree: This \"li\" tree contains forty \"fruits,\" each being a Chinese character sharing the same sound. If all one has is \"Li,\" it could be any of these characters (of course, some are more likely than others.) Thus, Li has to augment \"li\" by saying something like \"the 'li' as used in pear.\" Jon without the h. The situation is a bit better if the name is spoken out loud, because the \"tone\" is heard. Mandarin Chinese uses four tones, indicated by the color of the fruit in the tree above. Only three tones appear there, so apparently the first tone of \"li\" (shown in pink) is rarely used in Chinese names. In written text, the tone indicator is usually dropped, making it much harder to figure out which of these \"li\"s is the right one. The canopy of the tree casts a shadow on the ground, the size of which encodes the difficulty of the puzzle. According to their statistics, the 40 \"li\"s show up in given names with a popularity of 38 per thousand people. If you look more closely, there are two shadows. The thicker shadow is related to surname usage while the thinner one, usage in given names. One of the \"li\"s is one of the top five surnames in China, and so the thicker shadow is the outer one (76 per thousand). The writeup neglected to explain the two shadow rings. So, let's find one that has the opposite characteristic as \"li\" for comparison. \"Rong\" is rarely a surname so the thicker shadow is right at the base of the trunk while the thinner shadow related to given names is more visible. Interestingly, only one of the four tones appears in this \"rong\" tree. Returning to the \"li\" tree, let's analyze \"Li\" as a surname. The character in green is the second most common surname in China, but there are about a dozen other characters that can be someone's family name. Unsurprisingly, many of these characters only show up in given names. Because they are using the tint of the color to show relative popularity, we don't really know the drop in popularity relative to the green character (it's a huge drop-off). The value of this data visualization project is in structuring and presenting the data in a way that engages readers. This is a project that keeps readers focused on the trees, while losing themselves inside the forest, hopefully at will. Enter the forest of Chinese names here .",

This is the time of the year when I feel like I am getting close to the end of my rope. But it\u2019s also a good time to look back and see what I have done from the beginning of the semester up to now. I am always amazed to see how neat and energizing everything looks in September, and how, by this time of year, everything seems to be screeching. Anyway, since my last update, I have published four new posts. The first one was a new entry in my series on \u201cThinking with Data Visualization.\u201d In this post, I focus on the role data transformation plays in visualization and how the way data is transformed influences interpretation. The main message is that data is extremely malleable, and data visualization designers must handle this aspect carefully, because inappropriate calculations can lead to many troubles. The second post was another one on the use of AI in visualization. This time, focusing on the transparency problem. While I have touched on this problem before, in this post, I go deeper into recent techniques for addressing transparency issues in LLM-generated data pipelines. This post pairs well with the latest post I published, which is also about AI. In this one, I focus on something I have noticed while performing visual data analysis with ChatGPT and other common AI tools. LLMs have made it possible to do things with data that were previously impossible or at least very hard. In the post, I talk about what these things are and my experience with them. Finally, in mid-November, I also posted a personal selection of presentations I have attended at the IEEE VIS conference. I have been so happy to attend IEEE VIS again this year. I have been attending the conference so many times over the years, and every time it feels like a special occasion to meet people I have known for ages from all around the world. November has also been a special month because I completed the second cohort of my online course \u201c Think Effectively with Data Visualization \u201d (formerly titled Rhetorical Data Visualization). Teaching a new group of learners has been really exciting. Their engagement and acumen made every live meeting interesting and fun, and gave me an opportunity to assess and solidify the material. I plan to write more about the course, but I must say I am very satisfied with the results. Even though all the participants were highly advanced professionals, they found significant value in the course and the framework it presents. This gave me even more confidence in its value and the need to make this material accessible to as many people as possible. One of my goals in Spring will be to find new ways to deliver the main messages in this framework and to complete the series of posts I started here in this same topic. If you are interested in taking the course with me, send me a message. I am considering delivering a new cohort at the end of January or early February, depending on how many people enroll. In the next few weeks before the Christmas break, I intend to write a few more posts. I definitely want to publish at least one new article for the VisThink series. I am not sure yet what else I want to publish, but I have been inspired by many papers I saw at the VIS conference, so I may end up writing about one or two of them. One idea I am considering is to experiment more with videos, specifically by giving an overview of  individual papers I liked. If you like this idea, please let me know by leaving a comment. Leave a comment That\u2019s all for now. Thanks for reading!!",

        "full_content": "Today we're announcing several new reVISit features that were released in versions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. Major new features include an option to self-host data , remote screen-capture , a collaborative qualitative coding interface , and other features and improvements we're excited to share. For full details on the changes, look at the GitHub releases! Supabase \u2013 A Self-Hosted Alternative to Firebase [Beta] \u200b Maybe the biggest change is added support for Supabase, an open-source, self-hostable alternative to Firebase. Not all researchers can use products such as Firebase due to organizational or legal restrictions (GDPR, etc.). Supabase allows researchers with these restrictions to use reVISit inside an environment they fully control and own. Self-hosting is a bit more hands-on than using Firebase, so we make the setup as easy as possible by providing a docker-compose file to spin up Supabase on your own infrastructure. See Supabase setup guide to learn more. Note: we ran a few studies with Supabase without issues, but we don\u2019t have as much experience with it as we do with Firebase, so we're marking this feature as Beta until we have had more time to test with it. Screen Capture [Beta] \u200b Since its initial release, reVISit has included provenance tracking using Trrack . Provenance tracking can be very helpful for replaying and analyzing exactly how users interact with stimuli. However, it can also be tedious to setup \u2013 especially for complex visualizations with multiple elements to track, or when working with visualizations you don\u2019t control (e.g. website components ). So today we\u2019re introducing a flexible alternative for capturing user behavior: screen recording. In your study, you now can ask participants to grant browser permissions to record their screen \u2013 much like screen sharing in video conferencing software \u2013 with recordings stored in the reVISit infrastructure. This approach offers a much lower barrier to setup compared to provenance tracking and can be enabled directly through the reVISit config \u2013 no coding required! The video shows an example screen recording session that also includes audio recording in a think-aloud protocol. We\u2019re finding screen recording to be extremely useful for early-stage piloting, debugging, as well as conducting full studies. In fact, if you have other reVISit capabilities enabled, such as think-aloud or provenance tracking, the screen recording syncs properly with them, making it powerful to analyze provenance as participants experience it. See the Screen recording setup guide to learn more. As with Supabase, we\u2019re marking this feature as Beta until we have had more time to test with it. Qualitative Coding for Study Replays \u200b We\u2019ve added a qualitative analysis and coding platform to pair with our participant analysis and replay. This implementation based on what we described in our CHI paper , with extensive design improvements and additional functionality. The analysis displays the transcribed text for a participant and task, and allows users to edit the transcriptions as well as create and apply codebooks to the transcribed audio. The video shows an example of audio and video captured in a visualization drawing task, with the researcher applying codes to segments of the transcript. Codes are available for download as part of the data export, making it easy to integrate qualitative coding into your analysis workflow. Styling Studies \u200b We introduce new tools for customizing the look of the studies, making it easier to match your study\u2019s design to your research goals. Whether you want to make your study polished or improve accessibility for participants, you can do it all directly with the styling options reVISit provides. Styling can be applied in multiple ways \u2013 from inline styles to external CSS files, depending on the level of customization you need. Styles can be set at the global level for the whole study, at the component level for individual stimuli, or at the response (form element) level for specific questions. With styles, you can get really into the design weeds. For instance, you can make reVISit feel deeply polished by adjusting the form style study, using clean layouts, different font sizes, and bordered responses. The video shows a study emulating Google Forms\u2019 style: You can try it out and look at various other examples here . Advanced styling can be applied to make studies more engaging. For example, responses can enlarge text as participants start typing or change background when clicked. These interactions make study more engaging, providing a more user-friendly experience. Styling allows researchers to create clean, accessible, and enjoyable studies without complicated steps. To see more styling examples, check out the styling documentation . Live Monitor for Viewing Study Progress \u200b We added a new live monitor to the analytics interface. The monitor maintains a live connection to the database, and the moment participants answer a question, the heatmap and progress are updated automatically. This enables you to track participants\u2019 progress without refreshing the page. For studies that have fixed-length trials, it displays all questions and marks answered questions in green. For studies that have dynamic components, it will show answered questions followed by a question mark since the total number of questions is not pre-determined.  Note that the live monitor is currently only supported in Firebase-based studies. The video shows the live monitor in action: in the left video, a participant is taking the study, and on the right, the live monitor updates automatically as the participant answers questions. We show both, a static and a dynamic study example. Study Stages \u200b A typical study goes through multiple stages, such as debugging by the developer, pre-pilots with friends and family; pilots with real participants and then finally the main study. In data analysis, you do want to keep these stages separate to avoid mixing pilot data with real data. To simplify this process, we introduce a new stage management feature. You can now create stages and filter participants by their stage in the analysis interface. Stages are also prominently available in the data that you download from reVISit. By default, the study will be in the DEFAULT stage. Study designers can create new stages and give it a color, which will be assigned to new participants. In the table in the participant's view, we added a new column that displayed the stage name with corresponding color. Advanced Control Over Study Flow With Dynamic Sequence Blocks \u200b Dynamic blocks enable a study designer to build studies that require adaptive logic, i.e. the response to a question (e.g., right or wrong) can be used to determine the next (e.g., harder or easier) question. You can check out a simple demo here, or look at a real study on just noticeable differences of correlations we recently ran . To learn how to use the dynamic blocks in your studies, see the documentation . Study Summary Page \u200b We introduce a study summary page in the analysis interface. This provides a comprehensive overview of the study data in a single dashboard. The summary is organized in three  sections \u2013 Overview Statistics, Component Statistics, and Response Statistics. Overview Statistics show key information about the study, such as the total number of participants, study timeframe, average time spent, and the overall correctness of the study. Component Statistics give details about each component of the study, such as number of participants, average time spent, and correctness. Response Statistics show response level information including response type, answer options, and correctness. This new summary page will help you understand participants' answers quickly. To learn more, please see the documentation . New Libraries \u200b The reVISit libraries are a growing collection of predefined study components and validated questionnaires for visualization and HCI research. With just a few lines of code, you can import them directly into your study. We are excited to introduce several new libraries: Virtual Chinrest Calibration Library \u200b A virtual chinrest can be used to measure the distance between a participant and their monitor by detecting their blind spot. This reVISit library implementation was created by Sheng Long , and is the first community contribution! Visualization & Literacy Assessments \u200b We have added the Berlin Numeracy Test (3 versions), Graph Literacy Scale , CALVI (Critical Thinking Assessment for Literacy in Visualizations) , and Adaptive Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (A-VLAT) . The Berlin Numeracy Test (adaptive version) and A-VLAT take advantage of our new dynamic block feature, which supports adaptive logic, so the questions shown depend on participants\u2019 previous answers. Usability and Workload Measures \u200b We have added the QUIS (Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction) , SAM (Self-Assessment Manikin for affective reactions , and SMEQ (Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire) . We\u2019ve also updated NASA-TLX by adding the Source of Workload Evaluation, as recommended in the original NASA TLX manual. Screen Recording Component \u200b We also added a component that asks for screen recording permissions as a library. This is in support of the screen recording feature discussed above. New Components and Component Features \u200b Video Stimulus \u200b In 2.1, we\u2019ve added a video stimulus component, allowing participants to view video directly within the study. The video component supports both local videos or external video, with an option to force participants to watch the video which is useful to ensure that they watched the video before proceeding to answer the question. You can also add a timeline to the video to allow participants to skip to specific parts of the video. For more information please see the docs . Ranking Widget \u200b In 2.3, we\u2019ve added the ranking widget, which allows participants to order or group items. This ranking component is useful for study designers who want to capture participants\u2019 priorities, preferences, or how they categorize different items.\nThere are three types of ranking widgets that you can use depending on your study goals. Ranking Sublist lets participants rank items in a single list, which is useful when you want them to focus on the relative order of their choices. Ranking Categorical enables participants to rank items within high, medium, and low categories, which is useful when you want to understand which category an item belongs to rather than looking into the precise order. Ranking Pairwise lets participants rank items by comparing them in high and low pairs, instead of ordering every item at once.\nTo learn more about how to use a ranking widget, refer to our docs . Multiselect Dropdown \u200b The multiselect dropdown response became available in version 2.3. Previously, reVISit only offered a standard dropdown that allowed participants to select a single option. The multiselect dropdown enables participants to select multiple options. A dropdown response will automatically render as a multiselect dropdown if you define min or max selections in the configuration. Learn more about dropdown response in the docs . Random Order of Form Elements and Options \u200b In 2.2, we added a randomization feature for form elements and options to help reduce bias and improve the quality of study results. This feature allows individual questions, answer choices, or entire pages of questions to show up in random order for each participant, which is also recorded for replay. For more details on using randomization in studies, visit our docs . Previous Buttons \u200b Previously, participants were not allowed to go back in the study to change or correct their answers. In version 2.2, we added a previous button that allows participants to navigate back to earlier questions, if the study designer allows them to review and make corrections to their answers. New Configuration Options and Analysis Interface Updates \u200b Screen Size Restrictions \u200b ReVISit now allows you to set minimum screen size requirements to ensure participants have enough space to view study content and complete tasks. When a participant starts a study, reVISit checks their browser size and shows a warning page until the participant resizes their browser. If the requirements are not met within a time frame, the participant is automatically rejected. To learn more about how to apply screen size restriction to your study, please refer to the documentation . Analysis Audio, Screen Recording and Transcript (Firebase) Download \u200b ReVISit lets researchers capture and analyze participants' audio and screen recordings. Audio and transcripts , and screen recordings can now be downloaded for all participants or selected participants from the Participant View or Replay where previously you had to access these sources via Firebase.",

The first leader featured was Rufus Stimson in 1929. Over the next several decades 124 individuals were featured as leaders in the \u201cOur Leadership in Agricultural Education\u201d column in The Magazine . It was not hard to be identified as a leader in The Agricultural Education Magazine . Basically, a colleague or friend had to take the initiative to write such an article. There were no set criteria that had to be met for those featured. Publishing biographical sketches of the leaders was a common occurrence through the 1970s. Scholarly, research based attempts to identify and recognize the historically significant national leaders have been made more recently. In 1985 Camp and Crunkilton attempted to identify the top 10 leaders in the profession. They conducted a Delphi study that involved purposely selected teachers, teacher educators, state supervisors and retirees. A total of 30 individuals from all parts of the country comprised the sample for this research. The following ten individuals were recognized as historically significant national leaders: Ralph Bender, Clarence Bundy, Harold Crawford, Henry Groseclose, Carsie Hammonds, H. M. Hamlin, H. N. Hunsicker, Lloyd Phipps, W. T. Spanton, and A. W. Tenney. More recently (2010) Foor and Connors undertook to identify the pioneers in the field. They conducted an exhaustive search of the existing literature in agricultural education and then identified the individuals they deemed to have been important leaders in the profession. The researchers used their judgement to determine who should be identified. They identified five teacher educators or state supervisors (Rufus Stimson, Kary Davis, Walter French, Ashley Storm, and A. W. Nolan). They also identified four high school teachers \u2013 Ralph Condee (CA), Carl Howard (WY), Walter Newlin (IL), and Jerome Embser (IL). Recent Friday Footnotes have focused on W. T. Spanton, Larry Case and Steve Brown. These three Missourians served as national FFA advisors. One person who has been overlooked in all of the above efforts was Paul Chapman. He is a Missouri native and, in my opinion, deserves to be recognized as a historically significant leader in agricultural education. Introducing Paul Chapman Paul Wilbur Chapman was born in Brookfield (Linn County), Missouri in 1891. At the age of 14, during a school graduation exercise, Paul was involved in a discussion about \u201cWhich is the Greatest Benefit to His Country, the Warrior, the Statesman, or the Poet.\u201d Paul advocated for the Statesman, which proved to be prophetic for him ( The Brookfield Argus and the Linn County Farmer , May 13, 1905). Chapman received a B.S in Agriculture in 1914 and a B.S. In Education in 1916; both from the University of Missouri. He received a M.S. from the University of Georgia in 1931 and a Doctor of Science degree from Clemson in 1937. After graduating from the University of Missouri he taught science at the Macon High School. However, it appears the science he taught was agricultural science. In a letter published in the local newspaper ( Macon Daily Herald , December 18, 1915) about controlling scours he signed the letter as \u201cInstructor in Agriculture, Macon High School.\u201d In 1916-17 Chapman moved to Queen City where he served as school superintendent.\u00a0 Writing about his departure from Macon the Linn County Budget-Gazette wrote (May 12, 1916) \u201cThe position carries with it a material advance in salary and is a just recognition of the brilliant young educator.\u201d In 1917 Paul left Queen City to become superintendent of the New London School in Ralls County. During the summer of 1917, prior to moving to New London, he was a platform manager for the Redpath Vawter Chautauqua. At New London he was also the agriculture teacher. See Figure 1. Figure 1. An advertisement for the New London school that appeared in the Ralls County Record on August 31, 1917. During Paul\u2019s first year at New London the Illinois Council of Defense called on him and his agriculture class to act as agents for supplying Illinois with good seed corn. Apparently, the Defense Council had learned that Paul required each agriculture student to grow four acres of corn and his students were also testing corn for the farmers. Because of World War I, having quality seed corn was important. The agriculture students produced 2,000 pounds of quality seed corn. It should be noted that Ralls County borders Illinois. Figure 2. From the Weekly Kansas City Star , August 13, 1919. Another event that occurred in 1917 was the passage of the federal Smith-Hughes Act that provided federal funds to schools for the teaching of agriculture, home economics and trades. Superintendent/Ag teacher Paul Chapman submitted a request for federal funding and was successful in securing funding. It was the first school in Missouri to receive Smith-Hughes funding. See Figure 3. Figure 3. From the Hannibal Courier Post , February 17, 1918. Paul was a vocal statesman for the teaching of agriculture in Missouri schools. In 1919 he wrote a lengthy article in the Missouri Farmer titled the Agricultural High School where he described the activities at New London and in other high schools in the state where vocational agriculture was being taught. With the start of the school year in 1919 the State Board of Education in Missouri created an organizational plan for the administration of vocational education in the state. Paul Chapman was selected to be the state supervisor for vocational agriculture. With his usual work ethic and administrative skills Paul promoted the development of vocational agriculture in the state. But Missouri was not the only state that was ramping up their efforts regarding vocational education. Georgia was looking for an experienced educator to be their state supervisor for vocational agriculture. On July 1, 1920 Paul assumed a new position in Georgia as state supervisor of agricultural education. The new position paid $1,100 more than the Missouri position. Georgia\u2019s gain was Missouri\u2019s loss. The Georgia Years Between 1920 and 1933 Paul Chapman wore numerous hats in Georgia \u2013 state supervisor of agricultural education (1920-1924) and then state director of vocational education (1925-1933). He also taught at the University of Georgia. From 1934 until 1949 he was Dean of Agriculture and later Director of Resident Instruction (1949-1953) at the University of Georgia. During his tenure as Dean he had to guide the College through the depression and World War II. He served as national president of the American Vocational Association (now the Association for Career and Technical Education) in 1929-30. In 1934 he received an Honorary American Farmer Degree from the national FFA organization. In 1972 Chapman was inducted into the Georgia Agricultural Hall of Fame. His citation says: Dean Chapman was recognized throughout the South as an outstanding speaker, writer and advocate of agriculture. He earned the distinction as a leader when he led the College of Agriculture through a difficult period of adjustment and limited financial support. He was named Progressive Farmer\u2019s Man of the Year for Georgia (Curator\u2019s Note -He was recognized twice as Man of the Year \u2013 1939 and 1947.) His civic involvement included serving as president of the Rotary Club, Georgia Education Association and the American Vocational Association. He died in 1953 at the age of 62 from a heart attack. Significant Contributions to Agricultural Education While pages could be written about the contributions of Paul Chapman to agricultural education, we will focus on two contributions. Books Written by Paul Chapman In 1934 Paul wrote a novel titled The Greenhand . The novel was about a backwoods rowdy, Fred Dale, who turned his life around and developed leadership skills after enrolling in vocational agriculture classes and joining the FFA in the fictitious Cedar Falls School. In 1940 the book was made into a movie and was shown in movie theaters, gymnasiums and school auditoriums all across the south. For more details about the book and movie see this Friday Footnote published in 2018. The book was based on a true story. Cedar Falls was actually Cedar Grove, one of the first schools in Georgia to receive Smith-Hughes funding. In 1927 two professors from the University of Georgia were attending a father and son banquet at the school when a group of rowdy youngsters interrupted the banquet. After returning to the university, the professors shared their experience with Paul Chapman. This was the inspiration behind the book. For years the book was required reading by agriculture students across the country. Figure 4. The Greenhand. The Greenhand was not the only book written by Paul Chapman. He was a prolific writer and authored more than 15 other books. Books written by Chapman include: Farm Crops (1925) The Young Man in Farming (1933) Livestock Farming (1936) Occupational Guidance (1937) Southern Crops (1939) Better Rural Communities (1941) Better Rural Careers (1941) Round the World with Cotton (1941) Better Rural Living (1942) Successful Farming in the South (1942) Chicken Raising Made Easy (1943) Victory Barnyard (1943) Southern Horticulture (1944) Efficient Farm Management (1948) Pastures: Grazing, Hay and Silage Crops (1949) Sears Roebuck Scholarships Perhaps the greatest contribution of Paul Chapman to the world of agricultural education was the outcome of a conversation he had with the Sears and Roebuck Agricultural Foundation Representative, J. C. Haynes. In 1923 Sears and Roebuck created an Agricultural Foundation to help the farmer \u201cfarm better, sell better, and live better.\u201d Some years after the Foundation was created, J. C. Haynes was employed by the Foundation to work in public relations in the southern states with a mandate to determine how to help the farmers. Haynes was given a budget to help accomplish this goal. Haynes decided to go see Dean Paul Chapman at the University of Georgia to get his advice on what could be done to help the farmers. During the meeting Chapman showed Haynes a stack of letters from boys needing financial assistance to attend college and major in agriculture. Chapman suggested that the Sears Roebuck Foundation could provide scholarships to the boys. Immediately Haynes agreed to provide scholarships to 20 of the boys. Haynes liked the idea so much that he then traveled to Florida and Tennessee to establish scholarship programs for agricultural students. Soon the agricultural scholarship program spread across the nation. By the end of 1941, the agricultural scholarship program had spread to all 48 states, Alaska and Puerto Rico with 1,132 scholarship recipients that year. By 1948 over 7,400 agricultural scholarships had been awarded. A survey of scholarship recipients revealed (Emmert & Jeuck, 1950, p. 632) \u201cMany had become extension service workers, many were teaching vocational agriculture, and others were farming.\u201d Later the scholarship program was extended to students in home economics. The scholarship program ended in 1998. Figure 5. A Sears, Roebuck and Company check to fund agriculture college scholarship at Utah State. From the Deseret News , Salt Lake City, September 21, 1940. Concluding Remarks During this thanksgiving\u00a0season we should thank Paul Chapman for planting the seed with Sears and Roebuck to fund agricultural scholarships at agricultural colleges across the nation. Many of the scholarship recipients became agriculture teachers. Then, as agriculture teachers, they could use the textbooks written by Paul Chapman to educate the students and they used The Greenhand book and movie to further inspire the students to become active in the FFA. Paul Chapman, the farm boy from Missouri, was indeed one the most significant \u201cinfluencers\u201d in the history of agricultural education. Figure 6. Paul Chapman References Camp, W.

        "raw_html": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early years of our profession, biographical sketches of the founders and leaders of agricultural education were featured in\u00a0<em>The Agricultural Education Magazine</em>. The first leader featured was Rufus Stimson in 1929.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the next several decades 124 individuals were featured as leaders in the \u201cOur Leadership in Agricultural Education\u201d column in\u00a0<em>The</em>\u00a0<em>Magazine</em>. It was not hard to be identified as a leader in\u00a0<em>The Agricultural Education Magazine</em>. Basically, a colleague or friend had to take the initiative to write such an article. There were no set criteria that had to be met for those featured. Publishing biographical sketches of the leaders was a common occurrence through the 1970s.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scholarly, research based attempts to identify and recognize the historically significant national leaders have been made more recently. In 1985 Camp and Crunkilton attempted to identify the top 10 leaders in the profession. They conducted a Delphi study that involved purposely selected teachers, teacher educators, state supervisors and retirees. A total of 30 individuals from all parts of the country comprised the sample for this research. The following ten individuals were recognized as historically significant national leaders: Ralph Bender, Clarence Bundy, Harold Crawford, Henry Groseclose, Carsie Hammonds, H. M. Hamlin, H. N. Hunsicker, Lloyd Phipps, W. T. Spanton, and A. W. Tenney.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More recently (2010) Foor and Connors undertook to identify the pioneers in the field. They conducted an exhaustive search of the existing literature in agricultural education and then identified the individuals they deemed to have been important leaders in the profession. The researchers used their judgement to determine who should be identified. They identified five teacher educators or state supervisors (Rufus Stimson, Kary Davis, Walter French, Ashley Storm, and A. W. Nolan). They also identified four high school teachers \u2013 Ralph Condee (CA), Carl Howard (WY), Walter Newlin (IL), and Jerome Embser (IL).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent <a href=\"https://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/2025/11/12/the-missouri-way-from-missouri-roots-to-national-reach-part-2-11-14-2025/\">Friday Footnotes</a>\u00a0have focused on W. T. Spanton, Larry Case and Steve Brown. These three Missourians served as national FFA advisors.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One person who has been overlooked in all of the above efforts was Paul Chapman. He is a Missouri native and, in my opinion, deserves to be recognized as a historically significant leader in agricultural education.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><strong>Introducing Paul Chapman</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paul Wilbur Chapman was born in Brookfield (Linn County), Missouri in 1891. At the age of 14, during a school graduation exercise, Paul was involved in a discussion about \u201cWhich is the Greatest Benefit to His Country, the Warrior, the Statesman, or the Poet.\u201d Paul advocated for the Statesman, which proved to be prophetic for him (<em>The Brookfield Argus and the Linn County Farmer</em>, May 13, 1905).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chapman received a B.S in Agriculture in 1914 and a B.S. In Education in 1916; both from the University of Missouri. He received a M.S. from the University of Georgia in 1931 and a Doctor of Science degree from Clemson in 1937.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After graduating from the University of Missouri he taught science at the Macon High School. However, it appears the science he taught was agricultural science. In a letter published in the local newspaper (<em>Macon Daily Herald</em>, December 18, 1915) about controlling scours he signed the letter as \u201cInstructor in Agriculture, Macon High School.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1916-17 Chapman moved to Queen City where he served as school superintendent.\u00a0 Writing about his departure from Macon the\u00a0<em>Linn County Budget-Gazette</em>\u00a0wrote (May 12, 1916) \u201cThe position carries with it a material advance in salary and is a just recognition of the brilliant young educator.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1917 Paul left Queen City to become superintendent of the New London School in Ralls County. During the summer of 1917, prior to moving to New London, he was a platform manager for the Redpath Vawter Chautauqua. At New London he was also the agriculture teacher. See Figure 1.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4136\" height=\"152\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/2025/11/ag-advertisement.jpg\" width=\"600\" /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400;\">Figure 1. An advertisement for the New London school that appeared in the</span><em style=\"font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Ralls County Record</em><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0on August 31, 1917.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Paul\u2019s first year at New London the Illinois Council of Defense called on him and his agriculture class to act as agents for supplying Illinois with good seed corn. Apparently, the Defense Council had learned that Paul required each agriculture student to grow four acres of corn and his students were also testing corn for the farmers. Because of World War I, having quality seed corn was important. The agriculture students produced 2,000 pounds of quality seed corn. It should be noted that Ralls County borders Illinois.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4128\" height=\"636\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/drive/1ETt3aB-_zbzvWT6FO_5OnlXrflTHrlEW/New_london_Ag_students.jpg\" width=\"750\" />Figure 2. From the\u00a0<em>Weekly Kansas City Star</em>, August 13, 1919.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another event that occurred in 1917 was the passage of the federal Smith-Hughes Act that provided federal funds to schools for the teaching of agriculture, home economics and trades. Superintendent/Ag teacher Paul Chapman submitted a request for federal funding and was successful in securing funding. It was the first school in Missouri to receive Smith-Hughes funding. See Figure 3.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4129\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/drive/16s5N5Q0M_q6d8HrZEvvmZJ8A8srkKJki/Hannibal_Courier_Post_Feb_17_1918.png\" width=\"800\" />Figure 3. From the\u00a0<em>Hannibal Courier Post</em>, February 17, 1918.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paul was a vocal statesman for the teaching of agriculture in Missouri schools. In 1919 he wrote a lengthy article in the\u00a0<em>Missouri Farmer</em>\u00a0titled the Agricultural High School where he described the activities at New London and in other high schools in the state where vocational agriculture was being taught.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the start of the school year in 1919 the State Board of Education in Missouri created an organizational plan for the administration of vocational education in the state. Paul Chapman was selected to be the state supervisor for vocational agriculture. With his usual work ethic and administrative skills Paul promoted the development of vocational agriculture in the state.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Missouri was not the only state that was ramping up their efforts regarding vocational education. Georgia was looking for an experienced educator to be their state supervisor for vocational agriculture. On July 1, 1920 Paul assumed a new position in Georgia as state supervisor of agricultural education. The new position paid $1,100 more than the Missouri position. Georgia\u2019s gain was Missouri\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><strong>The Georgia Years</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between 1920 and 1933 Paul Chapman wore numerous hats in Georgia \u2013 state supervisor of agricultural education (1920-1924) and then state director of vocational education (1925-1933). He also taught at the University of Georgia. From 1934 until 1949 he was Dean of Agriculture and later Director of Resident Instruction (1949-1953) at the University of Georgia. During his tenure as Dean he had to guide the College through the depression and World War II.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He served as national president of the American Vocational Association (now the Association for Career and Technical Education) in 1929-30. In 1934 he received an Honorary American Farmer Degree from the national FFA organization.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1972 Chapman was inducted into the Georgia Agricultural Hall of Fame. His citation says:</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">Dean Chapman was recognized throughout the South as an outstanding speaker, writer and advocate of agriculture. He earned the distinction as a leader when he led the College of Agriculture through a difficult period of adjustment and limited financial support. He was named Progressive Farmer&#8217;s Man of the Year for Georgia (Curator\u2019s Note -He was recognized twice as Man of the Year \u2013 1939 and 1947.) His civic involvement included serving as president of the Rotary Club, Georgia Education Association and the American Vocational Association.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He died in 1953 at the age of 62 from a heart attack.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><strong>Significant Contributions to Agricultural Education</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While pages could be written about the contributions of Paul Chapman to agricultural education, we will focus on two contributions.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><u>Books Written by Paul Chapman</u></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1934 Paul wrote a novel titled\u00a0<em>The Greenhand</em>. The novel was about a backwoods rowdy, Fred Dale, who turned his life around and developed leadership skills after enrolling in vocational agriculture classes and joining the FFA in the fictitious Cedar Falls School. In 1940 the book was made into a movie and was shown in movie theaters, gymnasiums and school auditoriums all across the south. For more details about the book and movie see\u00a0<a href=\"https://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/2018/10/02/the-green-hand-10-5-2018/\">this Friday Footnote</a>\u00a0published in 2018.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book was based on a true story. Cedar Falls was actually Cedar Grove, one of the first schools in Georgia to receive Smith-Hughes funding. In 1927 two professors from the University of Georgia were attending a father and son banquet at the school when a group of rowdy youngsters interrupted the banquet. After returning to the university, the professors shared their experience with Paul Chapman. This was the inspiration behind the book. For years the book was required reading by agriculture students across the country.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4126\" height=\"524\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/drive/1NXCPmjJQ0gsFQ-Yfi2rZR_yNyae2eoSp/greenhand_cover.jpg\" width=\"350\" />Figure 4. The Greenhand.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>The Greenhand</em>\u00a0was not the only book written by Paul Chapman. He was a prolific writer and authored more than 15 other books. Books written by Chapman include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Farm Crops (1925)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Young Man in Farming (1933)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Livestock Farming (1936)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Occupational Guidance (1937)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Southern Crops (1939)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better Rural Communities (1941)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better Rural Careers (1941)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Round the World with Cotton (1941)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better Rural Living (1942)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful Farming in the South (1942)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicken Raising Made Easy (1943)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Victory Barnyard (1943)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Southern Horticulture (1944)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Efficient Farm Management (1948)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pastures: Grazing, Hay and Silage Crops (1949)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><u>Sears Roebuck Scholarships</u></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the greatest contribution of Paul Chapman to the world of agricultural education was the outcome of a conversation he had with the Sears and Roebuck Agricultural Foundation Representative, J. C. Haynes. In 1923 Sears and Roebuck created an Agricultural Foundation to help the farmer \u201cfarm better, sell better, and live better.\u201d Some years after the Foundation was created, J. C. Haynes was employed by the Foundation to work in public relations in the southern states with a mandate to determine how to help the farmers. Haynes was given a budget to help accomplish this goal.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haynes decided to go see Dean Paul Chapman at the University of Georgia to get his advice on what could be done to help the farmers. During the meeting Chapman showed Haynes a stack of letters from boys needing financial assistance to attend college and major in agriculture. Chapman suggested that the Sears Roebuck Foundation could provide scholarships to the boys. Immediately Haynes agreed to provide scholarships to 20 of the boys. Haynes liked the idea so much that he then traveled to Florida and Tennessee to establish scholarship programs for agricultural students.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon the agricultural scholarship program spread across the nation. By the end of 1941, the agricultural scholarship program had spread to all 48 states, Alaska and Puerto Rico with 1,132 scholarship recipients that year. By 1948 over 7,400 agricultural scholarships had been awarded. A survey of scholarship recipients revealed (Emmert &amp; Jeuck, 1950, p. 632) \u201cMany had become extension service workers, many were teaching vocational agriculture, and others were farming.\u201d Later the scholarship program was extended to students in home economics. The scholarship program ended in 1998.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4125\" height=\"204\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/drive/1w9rRutTDn2GbdJXpIrIZUOdUnr_VxKa1/utah%20check.jpg\" width=\"500\" />Figure 5. A Sears, Roebuck and Company check to fund agriculture college scholarship at Utah State. From the\u00a0<em>Deseret News</em>, Salt Lake City, September 21, 1940.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this thanksgiving\u00a0season we should thank Paul Chapman for planting the seed with Sears and Roebuck to fund agricultural scholarships at agricultural colleges across the nation. Many of the scholarship recipients became agriculture teachers.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, as agriculture teachers, they could use the textbooks written by Paul Chapman to educate the students and they used\u00a0<em>The Greenhand</em>\u00a0book and movie to further inspire the students to become active in the FFA.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paul Chapman, the farm boy from Missouri, was indeed one the most significant \u201cinfluencers\u201d in the history of agricultural education.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4127\" height=\"289\" src=\"http://footnote.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/drive/1imZ6bSGam0dQ99q4z9QFKAA3LtnuPvql/Paul-Chapman.jpg\" width=\"200\" />Figure 6.

Nor will I get (much) into the Discourse about how the world of Poverty Statistics Knowing has reacted to the post, which appears to be \u201cyes that\u2019s true and important, but it\u2019s nothing like as important as everyone recognising how clever I am, as set out in this long list of things the author has got wrong\u201d. To my mind, that\u2019s a crazy way to react; in the wacky world of inequality statistics , lots of things are really difficult to observe or quantify, so when you have a big socially important fact that\u2019s so obvious in the data that it can be established even with a motley grab-bag of numbers and a cigarette packet, you ought to grab for it. As always, my criterion for the quality of information is decision based, and if you ask \u201cto what extent might this lead people to make wrong decisions\u201d, then even quite seriously technically flawed work can be good and technically excellent work can be bad. What I want to talk about is something else, but related to the general thesis of \u201c Angrynomics \u201d, to quote the title of Mark Blyth and Eric Lonergan\u2019s book, and the tendency of the policy community to yaddayadda important facts like \u201cextremely normal things for people to have in their life plans, like starting a family, are unaffordable\u201d. Rather than pick passive-aggressive fights with anyone else, I\u2019ll use myself as an example of a regrettable tendency to make what I now think is a serious mistake in thinking about economic \u201cvibes\u201d. \u201cIf you characterise it that way, you can quickly chuck out a lot of candidate explanations. Inequality, social mobility and inadequate welfare state provision are all bad, but they didn\u2019t start three years ago. And although it\u2019s true that people hate inflation, this isn\u2019t the first period of inflation that we\u2019ve ever seen; we need a theory which explains why consumer sentiment is so much worse than you would have expected it to be given all the other economic indicators.\u201d The mistake here is in the background \u2013 it\u2019s the hidden assumption that the connection between the economy and the way people feel about it has to follow a treatment-response model, with no more than a fairly short lag. There are a lot of other possibilities! \u00b7 \u201cThe straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back\u201d. Familiar from employment law, where the institution of \u201cfinal written warnings\u201d means that it is usually the case that the thing you get fired for is relatively trivial compared to the things you got away with. The post-pandemic inflation led to the anti-incumbent election wave that brought in Trump, but that might not mean \u201cwow, people hate inflation so much\u201d. Maybe they already hated the entire system (Angrynomics was published in mid-2020, largely based on evidence from the 2010s). Maybe the inflation was just the last insult. \u00b7 \u201cAnother world is possible\u201d. Familiar from the collapse of authoritarian regimes, where the moment of maximum danger is not when material conditions are at their worst but rather when they improve and raise aspirations. Familiar from the divorce courts too. It\u2019s been pointed out to me that if all you ever looked at was your own bank balance, you\u2019d conclude that Donald Trump introduced a Scandinavian-style social insurance system and Joe Biden abolished it. Across the world, the pandemic support mechanisms might have raised questions in people\u2019s minds about why things which had previously been dismissed as impossible were actually possible, and made them less inclined to be satisfied with the return to a normality they had previously tolerated. \u00b7 \u201cOne day, he just cracked\u201d. Or there might not be any particular catalyst for the \u201cvibecession\u201d. Vibes might be like a supercooled fluid, just waiting for a random shock to change phase. Angrynomics documents how much reason there was for people to be angry, and how far back these problems had been in place. Then one day, it all crystallised. What I think I\u2019m saying here is that if you want a theory of economic vibes, it is vibes you need to be theorising about. Once more, it\u2019s an issue of \u201c having respect for the problem \u201d; if this is a puzzle or anomaly for normal economic analysis, it\u2019s unlikely to yield to one more heave through the chartbook and it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to be able to convincingly explain it away. And, in what I think is quite a serious flesh wound for the general agenda of Dataguyism, a statement like \u201cpublic sentiment about the economy seems to be uncorrelated to measures of how the economy is actually performing\u201d might be a lot less impressive than it sounds.

And although it&#8217;s true that people hate inflation, this isn&#8217;t the first period of inflation that we&#8217;ve ever seen; we need a theory which explains why consumer sentiment is <em>so</em> much worse than you would have expected it to be given all the other economic indicators.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The mistake here is in the background &#8211; it&#8217;s the hidden assumption that the connection between the economy and the way people feel about it has to follow a treatment-response model, with no more than a fairly short lag.</p><p>There are a lot of other possibilities!</p><p>&#183; &#8220;The straw that breaks the camel&#8217;s back&#8221;. Familiar from employment law, where the institution of &#8220;final written warnings&#8221; means that it is usually the case that the thing you get fired for is relatively trivial compared to the things you got away with. The post-pandemic inflation led to the anti-incumbent election wave that brought in Trump, but that might not mean &#8220;wow, people hate inflation so much&#8221;. Maybe they already hated the entire system (Angrynomics was published in mid-2020, largely based on evidence from the 2010s). Maybe the inflation was just the last insult.</p><p>&#183; &#8220;Another world is possible&#8221;. Familiar from the collapse of authoritarian regimes, where the moment of maximum danger is not when material conditions are at their worst but rather when they improve and raise aspirations. Familiar from the divorce courts too. It&#8217;s been pointed out to me that if all you ever looked at was your own bank balance, you&#8217;d conclude that Donald Trump introduced a Scandinavian-style social insurance system and Joe Biden abolished it. Across the world, the pandemic support mechanisms might have raised questions in people&#8217;s minds about why things which had previously been dismissed as impossible were actually possible, and made them less inclined to be satisfied with the return to a normality they had previously tolerated.</p><p>&#183; &#8220;One day, he just cracked&#8221;. Or there might not be any particular catalyst for the &#8220;vibecession&#8221;. Vibes might be like a supercooled fluid, just waiting for a random shock to change phase. Angrynomics documents how much reason there was for people to be angry, and how far back these problems had been in place. Then one day, it all crystallised.</p><p>What I think I&#8217;m saying here is that if you want a theory of economic vibes, it is vibes you need to be theorising about. Once more, it&#8217;s an issue of &#8220;<a href=\"https://backofmind.substack.com/p/respect-for-the-problem\">having respect for the problem</a>&#8221;; if this is a puzzle or anomaly for normal economic analysis, it&#8217;s unlikely to yield to one more heave through the chartbook and it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;re going to be able to convincingly explain it away. And, in what I think is quite a serious flesh wound for the general agenda of Dataguyism, a statement like &#8220;public sentiment about the economy seems to be uncorrelated to measures of how the economy is actually performing&#8221; might be a lot less impressive than it sounds.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Dan Davies - \"Back of Mind\" is a reader-supported publication.

Simulated interviews may sound artificial, but as a student learning the messy art of customer discovery, they offered something surprisingly real. In my Generative AI for Managers course at MIT Sloan, Professor John Horton asked us to explore user demand using AI personas. As a project for the course, I was designing MindBuddy\u2014a wearable headband that gently nudges you when your focus drifts. For this assignment, I used ChatGPT to simulate interviews and surveys with hypothetical users. What began as a creative shortcut quickly turned into a hands-on lesson in how to ask better questions, interpret patterns, and navigate early-stage ambiguity. Stepping Through the Assignment Here\u2019s how my AI\u2011augmented user research unfolded: Define personas and context. I created a few hypothetical users with distinct goals and challenges. For each persona, I asked the AI to elaborate on their motivations, routines, and frustrations. Design and refine prompts. I drafted open\u2011ended interview questions about focus, comfort, privacy, and willingness to pay. When a persona raved about a nonexistent feature, I adjusted the prompt to focus on actual capabilities and asked for step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning. Conduct simulated interviews. For each persona, I ran multiple rounds of Q\u2011and\u2011A. When responses were shallow, I used chain\u2011of\u2011thought prompting ( MIT Sloan Teaching & Learning Technologies, n.d. ) elicit deeper reasoning and reveal hidden assumptions. Analyze and synthesize findings. I organized responses into themes\u2014distraction triggers, privacy concerns, price sensitivity\u2014and looked for patterns and contradictions. As Professor John Horton said, \u201cThis approach can be useful even if it\u2019s not realistic or predictive \u2013 simply by raising considerations that you had not originally considered, simulating user research can better prepare you for other approaches you might take to collect information.\u201d In case you\u2019d like to design a similar assignment, here\u2019s a PDF version of the research assignment guidelines (approved by the teaching team). Download the Assignment How Simulated Research Can Inform Learning Generative AI gave me more than a fast way to generate data. It gave me a sandbox for learning how research works. The process combined the structure of a case study, the conversational depth of a focus group, the iteration of survey design, and the insight of a segmentation exercise. But more importantly, it forced me to refine my questions, spot contradictions, and reflect on what wasn\u2019t being said. That\u2019s what makes AI-augmented research so valuable\u2014it\u2019s not just efficient, it\u2019s instructive when used with care. Why It Worked Structure with room to explore. The assignment provided a clear process\u2014create a product, define personas, design interview questions \u2013but left the ideas and lines of inquiry up to each student. AI to augment, not replace, learning. Generative AI helped me generate ideas, spot patterns, and explore different lines of questioning, but it did not do the thinking for me. I had to decide which responses made sense, which ones to challenge, and how to turn raw output into meaningful insight. Risk-free simulation. AI personas allowed me to explore early conversations I might not have had access to otherwise, helping surface initial product risks and design trade-offs before engaging real users. This sharpened my thinking and made my questions more focused. It did not replace human input, but it prepared me to have higher quality conversations when I did talk to actual people. The simulation created a low-stakes space to practice, so that my real-world research could be more intentional and informed ( MIT Sloan Teaching & Learning Technologies, 2025 ) Navigating the Limits of Generative AI Working with generative AI for user research was fast and flexible\u2014but it also revealed just how fragile and fallible these tools can be. Large language models like ChatGPT don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d in a human sense. They generate text based on statistical patterns, not lived experience or factual verification. The results often sound confident, even when they\u2019re incorrect. As When AI Gets It Wrong: Addressing AI Hallucinations and Bias points out, generative AI models can amplify stereotypes, fabricate citations, and produce hallucinations that seem credible. These aren\u2019t reasons to avoid AI in the classroom, but rather to approach its use with a critical lens. As a student, I found that responsible AI use doesn\u2019t come from just following the best practices but also comes from running into the limitations firsthand. Here\u2019s how those moments shaped my approach: Treat AI outputs as starting points, not answers. In my simulations, some personas praised features MindBuddy didn\u2019t have. That forced me to slow down and treat outputs as speculative not factual. It also reminded me that plausible language doesn\u2019t equal truth. Cross-check with real-world sources. When an AI-generated survey suggested strong demand and willingness to pay, I compared it with market reports and my own intuition. The discrepancy helped me see where the model was being overly optimistic or generic. Use prompts that encourage reasoning. Chain-of-thought prompting didn\u2019t always improve accuracy, but it made the model\u2019s assumptions visible. That gave me the chance to step in, correct faulty logic, and sharpen my own interpretation. Simulated personas didn\u2019t just save time; they reshaped how I approach early-stage research. Compared to past projects without AI, this process lets me test ideas faster, iterate on questions in real time, and explore scenarios I wouldn\u2019t have considered on my own. Using generative AI for user research exposed gaps in my assumptions and surfaced unexpected patterns, but the real learning came from interpreting those outputs\u2014figuring out what felt true, what felt off, and why. It didn\u2019t replace real users, but it made me better prepared to talk to them. That preparation helped me refine the product idea itself. References MIT Sloan Teaching & Learning Technologies.

The LLM changes the benefit term (richer interpretations, smoother CX), increases the failure probabilities $p_i$ (and adds failure modes that didn't exist before), and increases the cost of controls (validation layers, fallbacks, monitoring). To see why the $\\Delta p_i$ show up\u2014and why they often dominate\u2014it helps to treat a workflow as a finite-state machine. A deterministic workflow can be modeled as a Mealy machine. $$ M = (S, \\Sigma, \\Lambda, \\delta, \\lambda, s_0) $$ where $S$ captures states or progress, e.g., Awaiting Evidence , Approved , Committed , inputs $\\Sigma$ are events the system accepts, e.g., claim_received , payment_confirmed , and outputs $\\Lambda$ are the system\u2019s actions, e.g., issue_refund , send_notice. The transition function $\\delta$ determines the next state, and the output function $\\lambda$ selects the action emitted on each transition. $s_0$ is the initial state. Commit edges are transitions with irreversible real-world effects. When we introduce a large language model into a deterministic workflow, we fundamentally change the nature of the system. The FSM, which was previously predictable and verifiable at every step, now contains stochastic components. Let me illustrate the potential set of  issues with three kinds of failures: Input . Traditional workflows receive structured inputs with clear semantics, e.g., selection of claim_reason from a fixed set using a dropdown menu. With natural language inputs, the model must map text $x$ to a symbol $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma$. Consider a customer saying \"my package arrived late and damaged.\" The model must map this to the appropriate system symbols\u2014perhaps claim_damaged , claim_late , and item=A . But natural language is inherently ambiguous. Does \"late\" mean past the promised delivery date or later than the customer expected? Does \"damaged\" refer to claim_damaged (70% confidence) or claim_defective (30%)? If the LLM maps \"used\" to claim_defective instead of claim_damaged , the entire workflow routes to technical support instead of replacements. Worse, adversarial users may exploit this ambiguity. Control Flow . Deterministic routing is a crisp function $(s,\\sigma) \\mapsto s'$. Given a state and input, there's exactly one next state. When an LLM controls routing, it becomes probabilistic. From the same $(s,\\sigma)$, execution can diverge based on how the model interprets context and intent. And the model may route in a way that violates your system's assumptions. For instance, an LLM may receive a damage claim and simultaneously route it to the replacement team, quality assurance, and executive escalation because it \"sensed urgency\" in the customer's tone. It might retry failed operations repeatedly with minor variations. Output . The FSM's output function $\\lambda(s, \\sigma)$ produces a symbol from the output alphabet\u2014perhaps refund_approved or claim_denied . But the LLM must verbalize this in natural language. When verbalizing, it can introduce promises the system never made or reveal information it shouldn't. An LLM told to \"send a refund confirmation\" might compose an email promising the refund will arrive tomorrow (when processing takes 3-5 days), include a 20% discount code (unauthorized), and apologize on behalf of the CEO (inappropriate). Anti-Patterns These points lead to two common anti-patterns. First, LLM guardrails. We take guardrails to mean something that prevents bad things from happening. But LLM guardrails are probabilistic and depend on distributional assumptions. Second, schema validation. Getting output in the right format is not the same as getting the right information. Making LLMs Less Risky in an FSM The goal is not to make the LLM deterministic\u2014that is impossible\u2014but to manage its impact. Effective patterns include: Keep stochastic components off commit edges . Use two-phase commit with some verification step using HITL for expensive actions like issuing the refund. Don't use LLMs where you don't need to . For instance, LLM may invent new reasons or promises when explaining a decision. Instead, render reasons from the decision artifact (facts, rules fired) using a template: $\\lambda'(s, \\sigma) = \\text{Template}(\\text{facts}, \\text{rules})$. Blast radius constraints . Spending Limits. Add constraints like $\\phi$ (e.g., \"total refunded \u2264 total paid\") with a runtime checker. If $\\phi$ would be violated, block the transition regardless of what the agent proposes. Monitoring, Rollback, Release Measure money. Measure refund leakage, inappropriate denials, out-of-policy approvals, avoidable escalations, etc. Kill-switches and selective disablement. You need the ability to turn off specific model behaviors without shutting down the entire system. That means you can disable a tool call, remove a branch, bypass the model on certain states, or route an entire class of cases to deterministic logic or HITL. Controlled, intelligent release. LLM-driven components should never go from zero to 100%. Release changes gradually: start with low-stakes states, narrow slices of traffic, or non-financial actions. Expand only after observing the dollar impact and analyzing data. Task Granularity: The Goldilocks Problem Breaking a workflow into LLM tasks involves a fundamental tradeoff. Large tasks cause reasoning failures. Small tasks cause orchestration failures. There's an optimal middle ground\u2014but finding it is more subtle than it first appears. For total work $L$ divided into steps of size $s$, we get $n = L/s$ steps. The simplest model assumes per-step error has two components: $$ e(s) = c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_0, \\quad \\alpha > 1 $$ Where: $c \\cdot s^{\\alpha}$: complexity-driven error that grows superlinearly with task size $\\varepsilon_0$: fixed overhead error per step (parsing, tool calls, handoffs) Total error across the workflow: $$ \\text{Total Error} = \\frac{L}{s} \\cdot (c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_0) = L \\left( c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s} \\right) $$ To minimize total error, we differentiate with respect to $s$ and set to zero: $$ \\frac{d}{ds}\\left[ c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s} \\right] = c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha - 2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{s^2} = 0 $$ Solving yields: $$ s_{\\text{simple}}^* = \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{c(\\alpha - 1)} \\right)^{1/\\alpha} $$ The formula suggests: Better models (lower $c$) \u2192 larger optimal steps Better tooling (lower $\\varepsilon_0$) \u2192 smaller optimal steps viable The simple model assumes overhead $\\varepsilon_0$ is fixed regardless of what's being passed between steps. But error could be multiplicative with loss in context proving damaging. A more accurate model accounts for context-dependent overhead: $$ e(s) = c \\cdot s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta}, \\quad 0 < \\beta < 1 $$ Where: $\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}$: truly fixed overhead (API calls, parsing) $\\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta}$: context serialization overhead that grows with complexity The choice $\\beta < 1$ reflects that context overhead grows slower than reasoning complexity\u2014passing complex context is hard, but not as hard as reasoning about it. Total error becomes: $$ \\text{Total Error} = L \\left( c \\cdot s^{\\alpha - 1} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}}{s} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}} \\cdot s^{\\beta - 1} \\right) $$ Taking the derivative and setting to zero: $$ c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha - 2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}}{s^2} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta - 2} = 0 $$ Multiplying by $s^2$ gives the optimality condition: $$ \\boxed{c(\\alpha - 1) s^{\\alpha} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}} $$ Since $\\beta < 1$, the term $\\varepsilon_{\\text{context}}(\\beta - 1) s^{\\beta}$ is negative. This means at the simple model's optimum $s_{\\text{simple}}^*$, the left side is less than $\\varepsilon_{\\text{fixed}}$. Therefore: $$ s^* > s_{\\text{simple}}^* $$ Context overhead pushes the optimal step size larger than the simple model suggests. Unlike the simple model, we must solve the optimality condition numerically and must calibrate. Other Operational Realities Models drift and change. Temperature $0$ is not a proof of determinism; vendor updates can shift behavior. Track versioned prompts and models; use canaries and rollback. Errors hide in plain sight. Long stretches of apparent success conceal catastrophic outliers. Track $\\sum_i p_i L_i$ and tail metrics (e.g., $\\text{CVaR}_\\alpha$) at the business level. Adversaries adapt. People learn \"magic phrases\" that bypass heuristics or trigger generous interpretations. Assume red\u2011teaming is continuous. The integration tax is real. Monitoring, fallbacks, rate limits, and escape hatches add complexity. Budget for it explicitly. Engineering with Uncertainty Moving to LLMs shifts the entire validation strategy. Deterministic components can be proven safe with unit tests: given the same state and input, they behave the same way every time. LLMs don\u2019t offer that. They inject variance, and variance doesn\u2019t break in predictable places. So correctness becomes a matter of risk budgeting rather than test coverage. Keep the model away from high-impact actions, let deterministic checks own the final say on anything expensive, and monitor behavior as if it were a live system rather than a piece of code. In the end, what matters is not how often the model parses JSON correctly but how much value leaks through policy violations, how much friction customers experience, and whether the workflow stays inside the tolerances the business can afford.",

We tested the alternative text of everything that we could think of in Word and PowerPoint and then converted these files to PDFs using Adobe\u2019s Acrobat PDFMaker (the Acrobat Tab on Windows), Adobe\u2019s Create PDF cloud service (the Acrobat tab on Mac), and Microsoft\u2019s built-in PDF exporting feature (save as PDF). With over 100 test cases tested first in in Word and PowerPoint and then in three different PDFs (over 400 checks), here are the main takeaways. Alt text within Word documents and PowerPoint presentations works very well. The process for adding alt text is consistent across every image type, and it is usually easy for screen readers to discover the alt text. Images in Word no longer require a layout of \u201cIn Line with Text\u201d to avoid accessibility issues. Alt text in Microsoft\u2019s PDF exporting feature is very good. If there is one criticism, it is that the specific image type can be added to the alternative text, making it repetitive (e.g., \u201cPie chart of sales by quarter (Chart: Pie)\u201d). Alt text support in Adobe\u2019s PDF tools is very disappointing. PDFs created with the Acrobat tab have problems with basically every type of image except Pictures. Details are below, including gotchas for almost every type of image. Notes These tests were done in the desktop versions of Word and PowerPoint 365. Not all of these techniques apply to older or online versions of Office. \u201cAlt text\u201d is the name for alternative text in Word and PowerPoint, so it is the term typically used in this document. \u201cImage\u201d is used as a generic term for objects that can be given alt text. Word and PowerPoint files were created using the current versions of Microsoft 365 for Windows (2509) and PDFMaker (25.1.20). The PDFs created with Create PDF cloud service were created on October 29, 2025. The options to insert equations and symbols were not tested because they create text-based content. Forms were not tested. Alt text in Word and PowerPoint Adding alt text is consistent across all image types. Selecting the object will display a temporary tab that includes the word \u201cFormat\u201d (e.g., \u201cShape Format\u201d). There is an Alt Text option in this tab. You can also right-click on the image and choose View Alt Text . There will be a field to enter alt text and a checkbox for Mark as decorative . There may also be options to add or accept AI-generated alt text (depending on your settings). Tip In Windows, you can keep the Alt Text pane open while using other tools like the Accessibility Assistant. To do this, click the Pane Options icon > Move Out of Tab . Accessibility Assistant Adding and correcting alt text is usually most efficient when you combine the Accessibility Assistant with a manual review. The Accessibility Assistant will automatically identify images with missing or suspicious alt text. There are several ways to start running the Accessibility Assistant, including Check Accessibility on the Review tab. The Accessibility Assistant pane has grouped all of its alt text issues into one category\u2014 Missing alt text . Choosing this category will step you through adding alt text to each image with missing or AI-generated alt text. Word has an especially useful and recommended feature that adds inline prompts for accessibility fixes. To enable this, go to File tab > Options > Accessibility (Windows) or Word > Preferences > Accessibility (Mac) and then check Show accessibility status inline with the document . A small icon will appear to prompt you to make inline accessibility fixes. Clicking this icon (this is mouse only) will open a dialog where you can add or change alt text, approve AI-generated alt text, or mark as decorative. Important Remember to save changes to the alt text by choosing the Save (Windows) or Approve (Mac) after entering alt text. Unlike the Alt Text pane, changes are not saved automatically. Microsoft\u2019s Built-in PDF Conversion For many years, the Acrobat tab consistently created PDFs with a clean structure that was easier to review in Acrobat. In late 2024, Microsoft announced significant improvement to the accessibility of their exported PDFs that matched Adobe in some places and surpassed it in others. While there may still be some areas where PDFs created by Adobe\u2019s PDFMaker and cloud services are superior, Microsoft is the clear winner when it comes to alt text. Creating PDFs using Export or Save As maintains alternative text for almost every image type, with emoji being the only true failure. The main issue isn\u2019t missing information in the alt text, but extraneous information. Except for pictures, the image type is typically added to the alt text that was defined in the document. This can sometimes be helpful, but it is often repetitive or even confusing. For example, there are about 150 types of shapes, each with a unique name, so a two-sided arrow with alt text of \u201cTwo-way communication\u201d would have alternative text of \u201cTwo-way communication (Arrow: Left-Right)\u201d in the PDF. Adobe\u2019s Acrobat Tab PDFs created with the Acrobat tab will vary based on your operating system. On Windows, it uses Acrobat PDFMaker, which is installed when you install Acrobat. On Mac, it uses Adobe\u2019s \u201cCreate PDF\u201d cloud service. The PDFs created by these two tools are different, but they have one thing in common-they both often lose or corrupt alt text as part of the conversion process. If in doubt, convert it to a Picture. A \u201cPicture\u201d is a specific type of image in Word and PowerPoint. Photos, as well as most images pasted from non-Office sources, are Pictures. You will know if something is a Picture if selecting it causes the Picture Format tab to appear in the ribbon. A Picture with its alternative text is consistently converted to PDFs created with both PDFMaker and the Adobe cloud service. One way to ensure that all your images are correctly tagged as a PDF is to convert them to Pictures first. To  do this, first copy or cut the image. On Windows, paste it back into the page  using right-click > Paste Options > Picture . On Mac, right-click (or select the Edit menu) > choose Paste Special > and then select one of the 4 \"Picture\" file types. While pasting as a Picture a good option for many types of images, some things cannot be pasted as pictures. This includes audio and video objects that would lose their main purpose. If an image supports being pasted as a Picture, the new picture can no longer be edited, so do this with caution. It is probably a good idea to create a duplicate version of a file and do this as a final step before creating a PDF. Important An image\u2019s alt text will be lost when pasting it as a Picture! To avoid losing the alt text, copy\u2014don\u2019t cut\u2014the image, paste as a picture, copy/paste the alt text, and then delete the original picture. Gotchas for Different Image Types The dozens of alt text bugs are too numerous to mention (especially creating a PDF using the Acrobat tab), but here are some notable quirks and pitfalls for different image types. Shapes: Word PDFMaker does not maintain alt text for shapes. In PDFs created by Microsoft, shape types will always be appended to the alt text. Icons maintain their alt text when converted to PDF. Just be sure to review and, if needed, change the preset alt text. Video and Audio: Even though embedded multimedia may not be included in PDF, the alt text for the image that presents it is converted. 3D Models are poorly supported in Adobe PDFs. Converting to a picture is recommended when using the Acrobat tab. Charts PDFMaker has no alt text support for charts in Word or PowerPoint. The text information contained in a chart is not typically added to the alt text, so be sure to include important text information in the alt text or in a nearby table or text description. SmartArt Do not bother adding alternative text to the different components within a SmartArt image. It is not easy to discover in Word and PowerPoint, and it is never included when converted to PDF. If SmartArt does not have alt text, the text within the SmartArt will be defined as the alt text in the resulting PDF. Groups: Microsoft PDFs will include the group alt text, plus the alt text or text of the items within the group. The inconsistencies of Adobe PDFs are too numerous to list. If you\u2019re using the Acrobat tab, converting a group to a picture is recommended. Tables: Do not add alt text to tables. In PDFs created from PowerPoint, it can cause the table\u2019s contents to be ignored completely. Draw tab Your drawing will be saved as a single image until you change a page or slide, change a drawing tool, or stop drawing. In PowerPoint, PDFMaker does not convert these drawings at all, meaning they do not even appear in the PDF. To make it easier to add alternative text to drawings it may be easier to group them or convert them to a Picture using Paste Options. Emoji : Only the Adobe cloud service provides alt text for emoji, though it does this by converting them into black and white emoji. Placeholders, text boxes and WordArt in PowerPoint Be very careful adding outlines or fills to any of these container types. This can impact how they are read (or in the case of PDFMaker, not read). Any content that is marked as decorative should be excluded from the tag structure when converting to PDF. This can be a useful technique when used intentionally. Unfortunately, the Adobe cloud service ignores \u201cMark as decorative\u201d unless the container has an outline or fill. Text Boxes and WordArt in Word: PDFMaker will not convert alt text or the contents of Text Boxes or WordArt in Word. Adding outlines and fills to Word paragraphs does not cause any problems, so use this technique in Word instead. Text effects in Word: Applying text effects like shadows and reflections will cause the text to be ignored in PDFs created with the Acrobat tab. It can also cause issues in Microsoft PDFs (like a screen reader reading \u201cdot\u201d for each period). The best way to address this issue to is to cut the problematic text, paste it as a Picture and then immediately paste the same text into the Alt Text field (Windows-only). In a Nutshell When it comes to alt text in Word and PowerPoint files. Keep  the following principles in mind: Use the Accessibility Assistant and Alt  Text pane to add alternative text to your images. Choose Microsoft\u2019s built-in PDF conversion for the best alt text results, especially if you have complex images. If you are using the Adobe\u2019s Acrobat tab to create PDFs, either convert your complex images to Pictures or be ready to do significant repair in Acrobat .",
        "raw_html": "<section id=\"intro\">\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, there are many types of non-text content that can be given alternative text. We tested the alternative text of everything that we could think of in Word and PowerPoint and then converted these files to PDFs using Adobe&#8217;s Acrobat PDFMaker (the Acrobat Tab on Windows), Adobe&#8217;s Create PDF cloud service (the Acrobat tab on Mac), and Microsoft&#8217;s built-in PDF exporting feature (save as PDF). With over 100 test cases tested first in in Word and PowerPoint and then in three different PDFs (over 400 checks), here are the main takeaways.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Alt text within Word documents and PowerPoint presentations works very well.</strong> The process for adding alt text is consistent across every image type, and it is usually easy for screen readers to discover the alt text. Images in Word no longer require a layout of &#8220;In Line with Text&#8221; to avoid accessibility issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Alt text in Microsoft&#8217;s PDF exporting feature is very good.</strong> If there is one criticism, it is that the specific image type can be added to the alternative text, making it repetitive (e.g., &#8220;Pie chart of sales by quarter (Chart: Pie)&#8221;).</li>\n<li><strong>Alt text support in Adobe&#8217;s PDF tools is very disappointing.</strong> PDFs created with the Acrobat tab have problems with basically every type of image except Pictures.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Details are below, including gotchas for almost every type of image.</p>\n<section id=\"notes\">\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>These tests were done in the desktop versions of Word and PowerPoint 365.

At some point during that period I developed a love of literature. But it was love at a distance, as one might feel for a starry night or unruly waves crashing into rocks. If there were hidden messages in the words, they were not meant for me, or for anyone with my particular intersection of cultural competences. That changed suddenly when a friend handed me a copy of Midnight\u2019s Children , Salman Rushdie\u2019s second novel. I could see right away that this magnificent book would entrance readers from every corner of the world, but also that some expressions would only be partially grasped by those who didn\u2019t share the author\u2019s linguistic and cultural history. Consider an example. When I first opened the book and scanned the table of contents, I noticed (among other things) a chapter called \u201cThe Buddha.\u201d What came to mind was the ascetic who founded a religion, sitting cross-legged in meditative contemplation. But once the chapter itself was reached almost four hundred pages later, it turned out that the reference was (also) to a different word entirely, much harsher in sound and meaning, an epithet for a decrepit old man. Two words so opposite in tone, united by the limits of transliteration, both suitable nicknames for the book\u2019s protagonist Saleem Sinai at that point in his life\u2019s journey: O fortunate ambiguity of transliteration! The Urdu word buddha, meaning old man, is pronounced with the Ds hard and plosive. But there is also Buddha, with soft tongued Ds, meaning he who achieved enlightenment under the bodhi tree. This passage will feel different to those who have spoken and heard both words over the course of their lives. Such a connection between author and reader, trivial as it might seem, meant something to me. I devoured Rushdie\u2019s next two novels, Shame and The Satanic Verses , both masterpieces every bit as entrancing as their predecessor. Salman Rushdie was at the Sydney Goldstein Theater in San Francisco earlier this month, in conversation with Poulomi Saha. 1 He has recently published a collection of stories, and disclosed at the event that the second of these\u2014 The Musician of Kahani \u2014was the first to be written. It\u2019s about eighty pages in length, more a novella than a short story, and according to the author will be the last to be set on the hill in Bombay where he was born. In fact, he says as much in the story itself, which concludes with a parting message to the fictional characters (including Saleem) who once inhabited the same neighborhood. The Musician of Kahani is the story of a girl with prodigious (and increasingly magical) musical talent, born to two mathematicians\u2014a mother who develops an early search engine that she sells to an American for a hundred million dollars, and a father who  is on the verge of publishing a proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem when he is \u201cbeaten to the punch by a British scholar.\u201d The story is hilarious in parts, horrifying in others, and so beautifully crafted that I felt transported back to those early days of discovery. Here is one passage: And her concerts! Our people are not reticent about expressing their appreciation in the presence of greatness. \u201c Wah! \u201d we cry out. \u201cWow!\u201d And also \u201c Kya baat hai! ,\u201d \u201cWhat a thing!\u201d And we do this during, not at the end of, the performance.

Those gents expected to be heard in reverential silence and applauded when they were done. Well too bad Ludwig van, Wolfgang A.! You\u2019re in India now. And here, during is the way. Here the performer and the audience are as one. Each lifts the other higher. Again, this will land differently on the ears of someone accustomed to hearing (or shouting out) \u201c Bahut Khoob! \u201d during brief pauses between successive Urdu couplets at a dinner party recital. 2 The fatwa , and the years of fear and hiding in its wake, had an impact on Rushdie\u2019s writing. How could they not? I certainly felt that no subsequent work of fiction reached the towering heights of his second, third, and fourth novels. 3 Until now. The Musician of Kahani is truly magnificent. 4 Could it be that what the dagger hanging over his head killed in his fiction was brought back to life by his survival of a brutal stabbing? The idea is absurd, of course, but would not be out of place in a Rushdie story. Salman Rushdie in conversation with Poulomi Saha on November 16, 2025. 1 I\u2019m in the Bay area for the academic year , working on a book tentatively called The Interpretation of Signals . This was my second visit to the theater\u2014the first was to see Arundhati Roy in conversation with Deepa Fernandes, who is also currently a fellow at CASBS. Roy\u2019s latest book Mother Mary Comes To Me is on my reading list for the holidays, as is a recent biography of James Baldwin by Nicholas Boggs that was mentioned by Rushdie during the conversation. 2 I have focused in this post on author-reader ties that are linguistic and cultural in nature, but some of the deepest connections transcend ethnic boundaries. 3 His non-fiction was also affected but in different ways; my favorite Rushdie essay was written shortly after the fatwa was imposed. 4 Here\u2019s another passage I can\u2019t resist quoting. This one describes the path taken by the musician\u2019s father, Raheem Contractor, in seeking a proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem (a path that eventually leads him to abandon his family for a religious cult): Raheem had examined and rejected all attempts to untangle the thorny conundrum, delving into the intricacies of the Yang-Mills equations, the Riemann Hypothesis, the P versus NP problem, the Hodge conjecture, the Navier-Stokes equations, the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, and found them all wanting. At last, after many long years, he had begun to understand that the answer lay within the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, subsequently known as the Modularity Theorem and was on the verge of publishing his proof, when he was beaten to the punch by a British scholar, who became famous and was showered with honors and awards, while Raheem Contractor remained anonymous in his university office. He was inconsolable, and his lifelong faith in numbers, and in his ability to use them as the building blocks of a good life, began to dissolve. He became vulnerable to other forms of belief. This is a typical Rushdie detour from the story at hand. I know next to nothing about these very technical branches of mathematics but am dimly aware that something called the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil Conjecture implies Fermat\u2019s claim, and that this was the path taken by Andrew Wiles in his celebrated proof .",
        "raw_html": "<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned in a couple of <a href=\"https://rajivsethi.substack.com/p/two-lives-in-one-day\">earlier</a> <a href=\"https://rajivsethi.substack.com/p/echoes-of-1983\">posts</a> that I spent ten formative years of my life&#8212;including all of my teenage years&#8212;in England. At some point during that period I developed a love of literature. But it was love at a distance, as one might feel for a starry night or unruly waves crashing into rocks. If there were hidden messages in the words, they were not meant for me, or for anyone with my particular intersection of cultural competences. </p><p>That changed suddenly when a friend handed me a copy of <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Midnight_s_Children/IT6vfrb5fNcC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\">Midnight&#8217;s Children</a></em>, Salman Rushdie&#8217;s second novel. I could see right away that this magnificent book would entrance readers from every corner of the world, but also that some expressions would only be partially grasped by those who didn&#8217;t share the author&#8217;s linguistic and cultural history. </p><p>Consider an example. When I first opened the book and scanned the table of contents, I noticed (among other things) a chapter called &#8220;The Buddha.&#8221; What came to mind was the ascetic who founded a religion, sitting cross-legged in meditative contemplation. But once the chapter itself was reached almost four hundred pages later, it turned out that the reference was (also) to a <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=tw-ob&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A2%E0%A4%BE&amp;op=translate\">different word</a> entirely, much harsher in sound and meaning, an epithet for a decrepit old man. Two words so opposite in tone, united by the limits of transliteration, both suitable nicknames for the book&#8217;s protagonist Saleem Sinai at that point in his life&#8217;s journey:</p><blockquote><p>O fortunate ambiguity of transliteration! The Urdu word buddha, meaning old man, is pronounced with the Ds hard and plosive. But there is also Buddha, with soft tongued Ds, meaning he who achieved enlightenment under the bodhi tree.</p></blockquote><p>This <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Midnight_s_Children/NKzepmTUipEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22O+fortunate+ambiguity+of+transliteration%22&amp;pg=PA402&amp;printsec=frontcover\">passage</a> will <em>feel</em> different to those who have spoken and heard both words over the course of their lives. Such a connection between author and reader, trivial as it might seem, meant something to me. I devoured Rushdie&#8217;s next two novels, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Shame/ku3E2X6OgeQC\">Shame</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/3cQGQomF524C\">The Satanic Verses</a></em>, both masterpieces every bit as entrancing as their predecessor. </p><p>Salman Rushdie was at the Sydney Goldstein Theater in San Francisco earlier this month, in <a href=\"https://www.cityarts.net/event/salman-rushdie-3/\">conversation</a> with Poulomi Saha.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> He has recently published a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Eleventh_Hour/OO1PEQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\">collection</a> of stories, and disclosed at the event that the second of these&#8212;<em>The Musician of Kahani</em>&#8212;was the first to be written. It&#8217;s about eighty pages in length, more a novella than a short story, and according to the author will be the last to be set on the hill in Bombay where he was born. In fact, he says as much in the story itself, which concludes with a parting message to the fictional characters (including Saleem) who once inhabited the same neighborhood.</p><p><em>The Musician of Kahani</em> is the story of a girl with prodigious (and increasingly magical) musical talent, born to two mathematicians&#8212;a mother who develops an early search engine that she sells to an American for a hundred million dollars, and a father who  is on the verge of publishing a proof of <em>Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem</em> when he is &#8220;beaten to the punch by a British scholar.&#8221; The story is hilarious in parts, horrifying in others, and so beautifully crafted that I felt transported back to those early days of discovery. </p><p>Here is one passage:</p><blockquote><p>And her concerts! Our people are not reticent about expressing their appreciation in the presence of greatness. &#8220;<em>Wah!</em>&#8221; we cry out. &#8220;Wow!&#8221; And also &#8220;<em>Kya baat hai!</em>,&#8221; &#8220;What a thing!&#8221; And we do this during, not at the end of, the performance. Beethoven would not have approved, nor even the giggly showman Mozart (as portrayed in Forman&#8217;s <em>Amadeus</em>). Those gents expected to be heard in reverential silence and applauded when they were done. Well too bad Ludwig van, Wolfgang A.! You&#8217;re in India now. And here, during is the way.

That leads to the question of why the change in views on race hasn't led to substantial reforms--if anything, public policy has shifted away from trying to reduce racial inequality.\u00a0 I'd say it was a lack of political leadership.\u00a0 In its absence, the desire to do something led to actions that were unhelpful or sometimes counterproductive (e. g., dropping standardized tests in university admissions). *It referred to \"negroes\" the first time it was asked.\u00a0 I also include a few that asked:\u00a0 \"Do you think that blacks who live in your community do or do not...have as good a chance as whites to get a job for which they're qualified?\"",

It outlines the problem, methodology, and results of optimizing policy analysis workflows given fixed resource constraints and insights from the assessment. Background Policy professionals face the same pressures as everybody else: we\u2019re asked to produce more with less, without sacrificing quality. The Minister for Finance might have asked for you to advise her about the revenue impact of a tax change in the next hour. Your consulting team might have been engaged by a client to undertake an overly ambitious evaluation of the country\u2019s social welfare system in a week. Or perhaps you\u2019ve just been asked to model the impacts of a policy intervention that targets an area of the economy that data isn\u2019t available for. While I\u2019ve grown accustomed to this as a policy professional, they became all the more tangible when I was hired to find ways to streamline a client\u2019s policy analysis pipeline.\u00a0 Located within the parliament, the client was responsible for producing a series of briefings to familiarize parliamentarians with the national budget prior to the vote. By providing members of parliament (MPs) with an accessible summary of how money would be allocated in the coming financial year it was hoped they would be better able to represent their constituents, make more informed contributions to the debate and encourage public funds to be put to good use. If you\u2019ve worked on fiscal policy before, the process will feel familiar: once a year the team was provided with a set of budget estimates from the Ministry of Finances that described where and how money would be spent and sourced from for the upcoming financial year. The team\u2019s job was to translate a set of detailed financial tables and forecasts into something that the average MP could understand \u2013 a set of accessible policy briefings. The budget analysis pipeline: illustrative results chain Inputs and resources Activities, workflows and processes Outputs Outcomes Impact Staff, time, software, data (etc) Processes for inputting data, producing analysis and creating briefing material. Briefing and analysis quality, quantity and alignment with the needs of parliamentarians. More informed parliamentarians and improved budget oversight. Better use of public resources and improved social and economic outcomes While, their work was familiar, the constraints they faced were not. Once a year a team of five people came together to produce over thirty technical briefings using budget data scattered across a series of poorly documented PDFs. Although there were guidelines outlining when parliament needs to approve the budget, these were not always adhered to, which often meant the briefings had to be produced in as little as five days. Since team members primarily handled non-analytical duties throughout the year, their analysis skills had also frequently deteriorated \u2013 limiting what could be produced and increasing the chances of errors occurring. It also wasn\u2019t possible to simply hire more staff, find more time or get the budget data in a better format. Instead, changes had to come from how inputs are combined to produce analysis and briefing material that would meet the needs of parliamentarians. Optimizing the policy analysis pipeline Setting aside questions about optimizing the impact of briefings for another post, my initial assessment suggested the problem could be framed as an optimization problem: how can the quantity and quality of analysis be maximized assuming the resources available are fixed? In an attempt better their policy analysis pipeline from this perspective I devised a simple methodology for mapping out their workflow, with the aim of understanding how staff time, software and data were typically used to produce briefings. This mapping included: Document and analysis audit: where past briefing and analysis files were reviewed and categorized to understand the process used for entering, analyzing and presenting budget information to MPs. Structured discussion sessions : drawing from insights from the policy analysis audit, analysts were asked a set of targeted questions to better understand and quantify bottlenecks in their workflow and identify potential workarounds. Anonymous surveys : were also distributed after each session to provide analysts with an opportunity to share insights they might have been reluctant to share openly during a session. Based on this, I was then able to construct a detailed listing of each step required to transform data from the budget tables into a final set of briefings distributed to MP. This included many of the typical steps that might be expected, such as manually inputting data into Microsoft Excel, producing a set of financial charts and descriptive analysis and transferring these to the briefing documents, which were reviewed by senior team members before being distributed to MPs. But, the mapping also suggested several pain points. Firstly, manually entering data from PDF files into excel was time-consuming and error prone. Even though briefings followed a standard structure and used the same data, they were independently produced by analysts \u2014 resulting in data being entered, reshaped and analyzed for each briefing document. Analysts also indicated that a lot of time was spent on checking the analysis at each stage of the process, resulting in each analyst\u2019s work being checked multiple times before a briefing was finalized. And because each set of analysis was produced independently, the final briefing documents didn\u2019t follow a consistent structure or style. Streamlining triage To identify which parts of the analysis pipeline would be most likely to benefit from technical improvements a \u2018streamlining triage\u2019 was conducted. The triage was made up of a series of true / false questions drawn from the principles of \u2018 Robotic Process Automation \u2019 (RPA) assessments. Steps that received more affirmative answers during the \u2018streamlining triage\u2019 were then shortlisted for a more detailed assessment. Questions included: Is the task repetitive, consistent and predictable? Can the task be defined using a set of logic and rules? Does the task benefit from the accurate processing of large amounts of data? Is the task unlikely to benefit from collaboration? Task characteristics and automation suitability More suitable Less suitable Repetitive and predictable Unpredictable and dynamic Logical and rule-based Requires judgement and creativity Require processing of data and accurate calculations Understanding of big picture patterns and context Independent Collaborative Adapted from: Agaton, B. and Swedberg, G., 2018. Evaluating and developing methods to assess business process suitability for robotic process automation. Department of Computer Science and Engineering; and Casey, K., 4/6/2019, \u201cHow to identify Robotic Process Automation (RPA) opportunities\u201d, https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/6/rpa-robotic-process-automation-find-use-cases Here be dragons: accounting for analytical Cheston fences Of course, being an outsider viewing the problem from an optimization perspective I also knew that some practices that looked inefficient might serve an important purpose \u2014 they might be bureaucratic or analytical \u2018 Chesterton fences \u2019 that shouldn\u2019t be meddled with. Maybe the onerous checks reflect established hierarchies within the organization. Perhaps having analysts own a piece of analysis in its entirety encouraged specialized expertise to be built on a topic. And it\u2019s possible that data being manually entered was less cumbersome than the automated conversion tools that were available. Reflecting this risk, components of the pipeline that were deemed suitable for streamlining under the triage underwent a further round of assessments to better understand the benefits, costs and risks of moving away from the status quo. This was done by examining each step and providing a qualitative rating of the benefits, costs, risks and sustainability of making adjustments to the current approach. Once a set of scores was given to a task it was validated by stakeholders. Streamlining viability assessment Criteria Example Benefits Would the streamlining / automation of the tasks improve the accuracy, quality and timeliness of briefings and/or analysis? Costs Would making the required change be worthwhile when considering the cost of it being implemented relative to the potential benefits? Risks Does automating the task present risks that are potentially costly and likely to materialize? Sustainability Are changes to how the task is conducted likely to be easily implemented, maintained by the client and the practices retained over the longer-term? The table below provides an illustrative example of what the results looked like. Overall, out of the fifteen discrete steps identified during the mapping exercise, seven were highlighted as being potentially suitable under the streamlining triage. Upon deeper examination, three steps were deemed to be viable for streamlining and two were suggested as being unsuitable. Two steps were also rated as \u2018unclear\u2019, implying that the viability would hinge on the nature of the solution. Benefits Costs Risks Sustainability Overall Data entry H L M-H M Y Reshape and clean data H L-H M L N Verify accuracy of data H M-H M-H M ~ Produce standardized graphs H L-M M M-H Y Produce standardized analysis H M M M-H Y Insert content into briefings M-H M-H M-H L ~ Distribute briefings L-M L L-M L N L = Low, L-M = Low to Moderate, M = Moderate, M-H = Moderate to High, H = High, ~ = unclear. The results Overall, parts of the pipeline that could be sustained by the client, had high benefits, low costs and presented acceptable levels of risk were then assessed in greater detail to determine the technical options available. Such as using off-the shelf analysis tools that performed the task on behalf of analysts, changing the workflow to reduce the resource requirements associated with it or building a bespoke tool that could be maintained by the client. Interestingly, because the structure of the organization and makeup of the team were assumed to remain fixed in the future, many aspects of the pipeline were deemed to be unsuitable for full automation. For instance, although having the data read from PDFs automatically would save a lot of time, having analysts for enter, clean and check the data ensured there was personal accountability at a critical point of the process. Similarly, while it is relatively simple to automate graphs and tables being inserted into draft versions of the briefings, having analysts do this manually assured they were directly aware of what had been inserted into a briefing and its source. Finally, although it was possible to fully automate the production of briefings, the technical solution for doing so was likely to be too complex for the client to maintain and would risk undermining the analysis capacity of staff. The implemented solution was elegantly simple: a structured Excel template that guided analysts through the budget analysis process from data entry to final output.This centralized approach to analysis also replaced the redundant workflow where each analyst independently entered and verified the same data for every briefing they were assigned. Entering all the data into unified table also made it easier to spot potential data entry errors using a simple set of sum-checks that verified whether the data was internally consistent. Standardizing the production of graphs and tables also made it easier to spot potential problems early in the process and ensured a consistent style was applied across all the briefings. Finally, although more feature-rich and modern analytical tools exist, the familiarity of Excel made it easier to use and maintain by the client. Since being piloted, the tool has greatly improved the quality and accuracy of budget analysis that can be produced, with one analyst noting that \u201cthe tool feels like magic!\u201d. Perhaps most significantly, the project demonstrated how finding targeted and modest interventions can deliver greater value than more ambitious initiatives. Although I expect this is true in any organization, in the public sector where institutional constraints and organizational culture are likely to determine what solutions stick, small and boring changes have the potential to yield significant gains. And even with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, the fundamental insights from this assessment remain true: The core challenges in policy analysis aren\u2019t primarily technological\u2014they\u2019re human. A note how AI was used: AI tools were used to refine how some ideas have been communicated.",

Two steps were also rated as \u2018unclear\u2019, implying that the viability would hinge on the nature of the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Benefits</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Costs</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Risks</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Sustainability</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Overall</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Data entry</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">L</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M-H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Y</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Reshape and clean data</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">L-H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">L</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">N</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Verify accuracy of data</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M-H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M-H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">~</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Produce standardized graphs</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">L-M</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M-H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Y</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Produce standardized analysis</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M-H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Y</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Insert content into briefings</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M-H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M-H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">M-H</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">L</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">~</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Distribute briefings</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">L-M</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">L</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">L-M</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">L</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">N</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>L = Low, L-M = Low to Moderate, M = Moderate, M-H = Moderate to High, H = High, ~ = unclear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The results</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, parts of the pipeline that could be sustained by the client, had high benefits, low costs and presented acceptable levels of risk were then assessed in greater detail to determine the technical options available. Such as using off-the shelf analysis tools that performed the task on behalf of analysts, changing the workflow to reduce the resource requirements associated with it or building a bespoke tool that could be maintained by the client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, because the structure of the organization and makeup of the team were assumed to remain fixed in the future, many aspects of the pipeline were deemed to be unsuitable for full automation. For instance, although having the data read from PDFs automatically would save a lot of time, having analysts for enter, clean and check the data ensured there was personal accountability at a critical point of the process. Similarly, while it is relatively simple to automate graphs and tables being inserted into draft versions of the briefings, having analysts do this manually assured they were directly aware of what had been inserted into a briefing and its source. Finally, although it was <em>possible </em>to fully automate the production of briefings, the technical solution for doing so was likely to be too complex for the client to maintain and would risk undermining the analysis capacity of staff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The implemented solution was elegantly simple: a structured Excel template that guided analysts through the budget analysis process from data entry to final output.This centralized approach to analysis also replaced the redundant workflow where each analyst independently entered and verified the same data for every briefing they were assigned. Entering all the data into unified table also made it easier to spot potential data entry errors using a simple set of sum-checks that verified whether the data was internally consistent. Standardizing the production of graphs and tables also made it easier to spot potential problems early in the process and ensured a consistent style was applied across all the briefings. Finally, although more feature-rich and modern analytical tools exist, the familiarity of Excel made it easier to use and maintain by the client. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since being piloted, the tool has greatly improved the quality and accuracy of budget analysis that can be produced, with one analyst noting that \u201cthe tool feels like magic!\u201d. Perhaps most significantly, the project demonstrated how finding targeted and modest interventions can deliver greater value than more ambitious initiatives. Although I expect this is true in any organization, in the public sector where institutional constraints and organizational culture are likely to determine what solutions stick, small and boring changes have the potential to yield significant gains. And even with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, the fundamental insights from this assessment remain true: The core challenges in policy analysis aren&#8217;t primarily technological\u2014they&#8217;re human.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A note how AI</strong> <strong>was used:</strong> AI tools were used to refine how some ideas have been communicated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>"

I think the best graphs come from the most simple variable whether the\nrespondent has smoked 100 cigarettes total in their lifetime. Here they\nare in gif form: If that gif makes your head swim, here\u2019s a faceted graph showing every\n5th cohort\u2019s trends. I see 4 phases of broad trends: Not enough data (Roughly 1890-1905) At first there\u2019s just not enough data and so there\u2019s too much\nvariation to see any clear trends. BRFSS doesn\u2019t have a lot of\npeople in the older age groups. A big part of this is due to people\ndying, but also the BRFSS sample frame doesn\u2019t cover nursing homes\nor long-term care facilities so it\u2019s coverage of older respondents\nis pretty poor. Further, to make this anaysis as simple as possible,\nI don\u2019t include respondents in the top-coded age categories (97 in\n1984, 80 in 2012 and later, and 99 in all other years). Differential mortality & women catch up (Roughly 1905-1935) Because we are looking at ever smoking, the fact that the slope goes\ndown is somewhat confusing. For each person, they can never change\nfrom an ever smoker to a never smoker. Yet, the percentage of the\ncohort who are ever smokers goes down in this period. This is\nself-reported data of course, so some of it could be changes in\nrecall or social desirability bias as time goes on, but a big part\nof it is likely due to the fact that there is differential mortality\nbetween people who have ever smoked and those who have not. This can\nbe caused both by the harmful effects of smoking as well as other\nbehaviors that are correlated with smoking such as alcohol and other\ndrugs and other risk behaviors. Another interesting thing to look at in this phase of the gif is that\nwomen are catching up to men in smoking prevalence. Presumably this is\nevidence of women\u2019s liberation and other changes in social norms around\nwomen\u2019s behavior. Rates fall, and men converge to women (Roughly 1935-1965) After generally increasing (probably partly due to differential\nmortality), the rates begin to fall pretty quickly cohort birth year\nover year. At the beginning of this phase, ~75% of men and 60% of\nwomen have ever smoked, and by the end they are below 50%. Seeing introduction of smoking (1965-2013) These groups are the first that we are seeing young enough for \nsignificant numbers of new ever smokers to be introduced (both because \nthey are younger when the first survey interviewed them and because the age of smoking introduction is getting older). This is shown by the \nupward trend for each cohort. It appears like men are starting to smoke \nmore than women again, though there\u2019s not enough data to be completely \nsure. Those are the first set of graphs I made from BRFSS. Hopefully soon I\u2019ll\nshow something about currently smoking and retrospective prevalence from\nBRFSS as well as some of the other surveys we have harmonized (YRBSS,\nNSDUH, NHIS).

        "full_content": "Table of Contents Daddy knows best? Dodging talk about tax dodging Daddy knows best? With it being cleared up in part one and part two that Carney was neither \"benevolent daddy\" nor \"malevolent daddy\" (coming off a supporter having effectively called Carney \"daddy\" after she yelled out \"Lead us big daddy!\" at an election rally), it turns out that Carney actually isn't the biggest daddy on the block either, NATO secretary general Mark Rutte having literally called US president Donald Trump \"daddy\" at the recent NATO Summit in The Hague. But while Rutte later cleared things up by stating that Trump wasn't so much \"daddy\" but rather was a kind of father figure to Europe (it'd be fair to surmise that Rutte and company have to do what they can to try and keep Trump somewhat onside, which may actually be a fool's errand), it should also be cleared up that although Carney comes with a rather deep resume, he may not actually have the specific knowledge required to properly address the threats to Canada's sovereignty as well as the parallel predicaments that will inevitably arise in tandem. Are arising in tandem. Throughout the recent federal election Canadians were of course widely reminded of Carney's economic bona fides, but according to a 2021 Guardian article it turns out that at one point Carney apparently desired to become a marine biologist. However, having amassed a slew of student loans during his time at Harvard, the most effective way he envisioned himself being able to pay off those loans was to enter the world of finance. So a career as a banker it was. Carney ultimately spent 13 years at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, likely earning a tidy sum while working at its offices in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto. In 2003 Carney left the private sector for the public sector, starting off as a deputy governor at the Bank of Canada (BoC) before becoming senior associate deputy minister at the Department of Finance Canada in 2004. Come February 1 st 2008, on what turned out to be the eve of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), Carney superseded other more qualified candidates and was appointed governor of the BoC. During what was seen to be a widely successful stint in Ottawa, Carney was headhunted by then-chancellor George Osborne to become the next governor of the Bank of England (BoE), commencing the position on July 1 st 2013 (and staying until he left in March of 2020) with the notable introduction of being lauded as the \"rock star of central banking\". But while Carney has been widely credited with assisting Canada in avoiding the worst effects of the GFC (unlike other countries, none of Canada's banks collapsed and its economy returned to growth much quicker than others), not only might some of the hype be misplaced, but for those of us in the know it would appear that Carney doesn't understand what the underlying cause of the GFC was. That being so (of which will be fully explained in the fourth and final part of this series), if we Canadians are to have Carney as our point man against the encroaching United States then we ought to be fully informed about any blind spots the new prime minister may come with, what effect those blind spots may have on the approaches he may take, and what Canadians might want to do in light of all that. Before elaborating on the above in the follow-up piece to this third part, in order to better understand Carney's thinking a few words shall first be relayed describing how conventional of a banker he appears to be. Dodging talk about tax dodging As virtually every Canadian knew, the recent federal election was essentially a race between two parties (and their leaders): the left-of-centre Liberal Party led by former (central) banker Mark Carney versus the right-of-centre (but increasingly populist-right/alt-right) Conservative Party led by career politician Pierre Poilievre. Understanding the gravity of the matter (the threat of a MAGA-aligned federal party coming to power in Canada), a significant amount of Canadians sympathetic to third parties (predominantly the NDP, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, and Greens) overwhelmingly decided to bite the bullet by abandoning their preferred choice for the lesser evil of Mark Carney and the Liberals. The \"lesser evil\"? Well, yes. Prior to his stints at the BoC and the BoE Carney was after all a banker at Goldman Sachs, after which he held several positions in both the public and private sectors, including chair of Bloomberg L.P., Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance at the UN, co-chair of the World Bank's private sector investment lab and, amongst other positions, was \u2013 as of October 2020 and up until he ran for the Liberal leadership \u2013 also chair and head of impact investing at Brookfield Asset Management. While Brookfield isn't exactly a household name, it does nonetheless manage more than US$1tn in assets , making it not only one of Canada's largest publicly traded companies but one of the world's largest investment firms. Some of those assets are in various mining, infrastructure and insurance companies, casinos, lotteries and sports-betting ventures, and more. While its hundreds of billions of dollars in real estate ownership include such notable developments as New York City's Hudson Yards as well as London's Canary Wharf , Brookfield is also one of the largest residential property owners in the US and Canada. A 2024 annual report pointed out that Brookfield controls 73,337 single family lots and 220 multi-family, industrial and commercial serviced parcel acres in both the US and Canada. As then-NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said to Carney during the leadership debate, \"As chair, you approved decisions where Brookfield bought up affordable homes, kicked out the tenants, and jacked up the rents\". That 31,211 of Brookfield's jacked-up-in-rent 73,337 lots are in Canada (at a time when Canada and much of the rest of the world is in the midst of a housing crisis) might not come off as a very good look for the highly profitable corporate landlord in the eyes of struggling Canadians. To make matters worse, two-thirds of Brookfield's revenue emanate from private equity, which in this case entails the vampiric takeover of valuable companies, companies in which as many jobs as possible are eliminated and which after being stripped for parts have those pieces sold off to the highest bidder. In a similar fashion, Brookfield also operates in the field of credit (particularly distressed securities), a sector in which it buys up debt with the intent of reorganizing or liquidating the debtor in order to turn a profit. As the practise of trading in distressed securities implies taking advantage of the misfortune of others, those that partake in this field are generally referred to as \"vulture funds\". Thanks to his role at Brookfield, it's not for no reason that Carney has been called a \"cutthroat capitalist\" and \"a man devoted to the pursuit of wealth and the maximization of profit\" by Canadian magazine The Walrus . It doesn't stop there though, Singh having also stated to Carney during the debate that \"Brookfield Investments, your company, is one of the biggest tax dodgers in Canada\" (a claim that wasn't acknowledged in any way whatsoever by Carney). (source: CBC News / YouTube ) For starters, a 2023 report by The Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research (CICTAR) stated that Brookfield may be the number one tax avoider in Canada. Brookfield's track record of alleged tax dodging has received some attention in Australia and Canada, where it may claim the title of Canada's top tax dodger. How did Brookfield achieve this \"esteemed\" distinction? Well, by utilizing its network of more than 40 subsidiaries / shell companies registered in a variety of tax havens \u2013 including Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Panama and Malta \u2013 Brookfield enabled itself to avoid paying Canada several billion dollars in taxes. As the NDP have highlighted , Brookfield made US$23.3bn between 2021 and 2024, years in which Carney was with the firm. With Canada's tax rate being 26.4%, Brookfield should have paid US$6.1bn in taxes. Instead, it paid only US$2bn in taxes, a shortcoming of US$4.1bn (CAD$5.3bn) in revenue that Canada missed out on. To be clear, Brookfield didn't partake in tax evasion but rather tax avoidance, implying that what it did was in fact lawful. By utilising various structures in the tax code, billion dollar companies like Brookfield are able to hire Harvard/Oxford graduates like Carney to take advantage of loopholes (that are sometimes there for good reason, sometimes not) and via subsidiaries in tax havens can then keep billions of dollars out of the reach of tax authorities. That Carney was able to go out on the campaign trail and proclaim how much he \"care[s] about people\" can come off as a bit rich considering how many livelihoods Brookfield has destroyed over the years, including during the period in which Carney was employed by the company. For as was also stated in that report by CICTAR, Aggressive tax avoidance, whether legal or not, deprives governments of revenue desperately needed to fund essential public services \u2013 including health, education, and sanitation. While both the Conservatives and the NDP attacked Carney on the campaign trail for his usage of offshore tax havens, Carney, while directly avoiding speaking about the ethics behind Brookfield's practices, stated that Brookfield nonetheless \"follows the rules\". Similarly questionable was the occasion in which Carney claimed during a 2021 interview with Bloomberg that Brookfield was a net zero company. While Brookfield \u2013 which had a US$600bn portfolio at the time \u2013 not only had significant fossil fuel investments but was also the world's second-largest investor in climate-friendly businesses , Carney in turn claimed that those clean energy businesses had offset its coal, oil and gas investments. Various climate experts and environmental campaigners (such as Science Based Targets initiative and Greenpeace, respectively) called Carney out for \"greenwashing\", Carney eventually qualifying his claims with an acknowledgement on Twitter that having investments in renewable energy are not the same as having net zero emissions, as so-called avoided emissions \"do not count towards\" net zero targets. Mark Carney @MarkJCarney On the critical role of renewables and science-based targets in winning the race to net zero, please see my statement. @Brookfield Yes, there's a few other questionable instances in which \u2013 horror of all horrors \u2013 Carney got a few dates and the like wrong, but seeing how the far-right rags readily covered all that (whose websites and articles about this I'm not going to link to, of which are none too surprisingly run on Substack ) I'll go ahead and omit it all from this piece. In summation, with parts one and two (respectively) dismissing the adulatory and disdainful descriptions painted of Carney, and then this part three having effectively laid bare the manner in which Carney is essentially another run-of-the-mill banker (\"devoted to the pursuit of wealth and the maximization of profit\") with a bit of side action (his central bank governorships, work with the UN, etc.), what remains to be ascertained are Carney's shortcomings. Shortcomings that (partially based on how long he sticks around as Canada's prime minister) may have consequences that (due to Trump still making 51 st state threats to Canada, and simultaneously due to the leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada itching to be what Alexander Lukashenko is to Vladimir Putin) may result in Canada becoming the 51 st state by either de jure or de facto manner. Part four in this series will therefore outline those aforementioned shortcomings of Carney's, while simultaneously giving a thorough explanation of the economic predicaments that by all appearances Carney doesn't seem to understand. With the fourth and final part of this series out of the way, we'll then move onto the next (related) series. But first things first. Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5",

html-->\n<p>Yes, there&apos;s a few other questionable instances in which &#x2013; horror of all horrors &#x2013; Carney got a few dates and the like wrong, but seeing how the far-right rags readily covered all that (whose websites and articles about this I&apos;m not going to link to, of which are none too surprisingly run on <a href=\"https://ff2f.com/how-to-ghost-substack/\">Substack</a>) I&apos;ll go ahead and omit it all from this piece.</p><hr /><p>In summation, with parts one and two (respectively) dismissing the adulatory and disdainful descriptions painted of Carney, and then this part three having effectively laid bare the manner in which Carney is essentially another run-of-the-mill banker (&quot;devoted to the pursuit of wealth and the maximization of profit&quot;) with a bit of side action (his central bank governorships, work with the UN, etc.), what remains to be ascertained are Carney&apos;s shortcomings. Shortcomings that (partially based on how long he sticks around as Canada&apos;s prime minister) may have consequences that (due to Trump still making 51<sup>st</sup> state threats to Canada, and simultaneously due to the leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada itching to be what Alexander Lukashenko is to Vladimir Putin) may result in Canada becoming the 51<sup>st</sup> state by either <em>de jure</em> or <em>de facto</em> manner.</p><p>Part four in this series will therefore outline those aforementioned shortcomings of Carney&apos;s, while simultaneously giving a thorough explanation of the economic predicaments that by all appearances Carney doesn&apos;t seem to understand. With the fourth and final part of this series out of the way, we&apos;ll then move onto the next (related) series.

        "full_content": "When people think about the Great Depression, many assume this was the worst moment to live in financially. This is far from the truth and this thread will prove that. By comparing the wages of Americans the last 250 years during specific years we will see the truth of how the common worker in 2024 is currently being stretched financially beyond imagination. Consider becoming a free subscriber to receive emails of new articles or a paid subscriber to read exclusive content, comment on all threads and to support my work. 1813 The first year that we will look is the year 1813, which was the year the Napoleonic Wars happened and the Rothschilds rose to power financially in Europe. We will compare wages to the price of a House when everything was paid with hard money, rather than paper money. A carpenter in 1813 was making $1 - $1.43 per day. Carpenters on average make $75 - $125 per day in 2024 AD. Using hired laborers, a two-room log house in 1813 might cost $100 to build; a smaller house might cost $50 - Source: Talbot's History of North America , vol. 2, p. 18. Keep in mind the houses were a lot smaller but lets compare. As of August 9, 2024, the median price of an existing single-family home in the United States was $432,700. That\u2019s 5000 times the cost of houses back in 1813. If we adjust for inflation, the carpenter making $75 - $125 per day in 2024 would only have to pay $3,750 - $8,741 for a house in 1813. It would only take someone half a year to save up enough money to build a log cabin, which means if we compare the house prices of today, the carpenters wage would have to be $865,400 / year. This was the most affordable time in United States history. 1861 The next year we will look at is when the American Civil War happened in 1861. We will once again compare wages with the price of a house but also the cost of owning and traveling in a horse carriage. Just like in 1813 the average daily wage was around $1 a day for a common worker but a high end lawyer was making around $5 a day, which was around $1800 per year - Source In the west US it was possible to buy a horse for as little as $10, but a decent riding equine cost around $150, with a range of $120 (1861) to $185 (1865). A pack horse for the Oregon Trail cost $25 in the US in 1850, but a riding horse would run you $75. Lets compare. A horse was the main source of individual travel before the automobile came out but lets still see if the financial burden was as bad as buying a car today. The average transaction price (ATP) for a new car in 2024 in the U.S. was $48,644, according to Cox Automotive. Going forward we will compare every wage in the past to the minimum wage in 2024. The lowest minimum wage is $7.25 / hour, which equals $58 / day, which is shared by many states. The highest minimum wage is $16 / hour, which equals $128 / day, which is the min. wage of California. So now lets enforce the 1861 economy into todays prices: The common laborer when buying a new vehicle (horse) would only have to pay $580, since a cheap horse was only 10x the amount of his daily work. Today a car is 840x the amount of workers daily work. The reason I used the cheap $10 horse in this example is because a car that costs $48,644 today is on the lower end of car prices. Source The housing situation in the 1860\u2019s was getting more expensive than that in the 1810\u2019s, which is a pattern we will continue to see as we get closer to the present day. Remember that as of August 9, 2024, the median price of an existing single-family home in the United States was $432,700. That\u2019s still 1000 times the cost of houses back in 1813. But that\u2019s because of inflation so lets compare the wage to housing prices to get a better idea: Today, it is literally impossible for a minimum wage worker to afford a house. Making only $58 / day it would take them over 30 years just to collect the funds to buy a house. This is of course if this worker didn\u2019t miss one of the 270  work days in a year and never took a vacation. Back in 1860 on the $1 / day wage, it would only take someone 1.5 years to afford a $400 house. Life was affordable for even the lowest paying worker in the past. Here\u2019s a better way to look at it. In order for someone to pay for a $432,700 house in 1.5 years, like in 1860, the minimum wage can\u2019t be lower than $288,466 / year. Think about that. That\u2019s how much money the government, bankers, loaners, evil men, etc. have stolen from the common worker the last 200 years. 1908 50 years later the world went through the Industrial Revolution and saw the introduction of the automobile. In the year 1908, Henry Ford created the affordable Model T and it was the time period before the Federal Reserve was created, which established Central Banking. Source In this chart we see that some people are making less than $1 / day, which was the low in 1813 and 1861. Will the influx of immigrants rushing to American Big cities on the East coast, many immigrants were taken advantage of and played significantly less. Because of the population boom in America rent becomes a major way for people to find housing. We also see the housing market forming, which saw the introduction of larger houses being mass produced. Here\u2019s a great source of a 1903 booklet showing \u2018 The Radford American Homes \u2019 and their prices. Remember the evolution of home prices: 1813 \u2014> $50 log house 1861 \u2014> $400 - $1200 cottages 1908 \u2014> $300 - $4200 Here\u2019s a 1903 larger house selling for $3850: Here\u2019s a 1903 smaller house selling for $650: Now lets compare: The interesting thing is that gap between the poor man and commodities has increased. Many people in 1908 were being payed less than $3 a week. So lets see how long it would take them to afford a cheap house of $300. Since it\u2019s easy math, it would take 100 weeks (2 years) for a low paying wage to afford a cheap house. This is significantly better than the situation in 2024. The cheapest houses today sell for around $200,000. Remember the minimum wage worker makes $58 / day, which translates into $290 / week. This means it would take them 13 years to afford the cheapest house, which is significantly worse than the poorest of the poor immigrants who moved to American in the early 1900s. 1908 was also the year the Ford Model T came out and when automobiles became the favorite transportation tool for the wealthy. As you will see these new automobiles cost as much as new houses. Some vehicles were more expensive than new house when they came out. Very similar to today with the ultra wealthy cars, such as Rolls Royce, Lamborghini, etc. The main source of transportation was still horse and buggy and the popularity of it wouldn\u2019t decline until 1910 and would completely disappear in cities around 1920. Since the wage of lowest paying worker declined and housing prices rose the standard of living decreased since the 1800\u2019s but it was still significantly better than today. It took a low paying worker 2 years of saving in 1908 to afford a house, which translates to the minimum wage being $216,350 / year in today\u2019s money terms. 1932 Now lets fast forward to the worst year of the Great Depression and see if it was worst than 2024. As you can tell this was they started tracking pay / hour. What\u2019s interesting about the chart above is that the low paying workers made 5 - 10 cents per hour, which was   even worse than the lowest payed workers in 1813. The low payed workers were unfortunately the African Americans who were still being segregated during this time. This major pattern of keeping the wages the same and increasing the prices of everything else shows that the government / companies don\u2019t care about the workforce\u2019s standard of living. The world is run on greed and it continues to get worse every year. The price of cars became more common for the everyday man and saw prices between $500 - $700. But with the wages of the poorest Americans decreasing since 1813, it would now take someone 4.5 years of saving to afford an automobile. The days of buying an expensive horse for $75 were over. The days of caring about the standard living of the poor man were over. America was now down the road of making the rich richer and poor poorer. The 1930\u2019s is the first time we will see tuition prices for colleges - source : The average tuition cost for a coeducational in state intuition was $76 / year. On a salary of $0.40 / day, it would take 266 days, which is less than a year. Lets compare that with the average tuition price today with the minimum wage. The average tuition price in 2024 is $11,260 / year and the minimum wage in a lot of states is $58 / day. This mean it would take a person 270 days with that wage to afford college. So in other words for a someone trying to pay for college and making the minimum wage in 2024, feels very similar to a segregated African American in the worst year of the Great Depression trying to afford to go to college. But that\u2019s just college so lets compare the prices of houses: In the catalog below we see a Sears catalog of housing prices ranging from $1300 -$5000. Remember the lowest payed worker gets payed 0.40 - 0.80 cents per day so this would take the person making 40 cents per day 13 years to afford their home. This is still significantly better than the 2024 minimum wage worker taking 30 years to pay for a house. This means the lowest payed worker during the worst year of the Great Depression was living in the same standard of living as someone making minimum wage in 2024. So what happened between 1908 and 1931 that made the situation so much worse? It was the establishment of the Federal Reserve, the World War, the Great Depression, the introduction of income tax and the banks collecting gold from the citizens to force a paper economy they could control. Also we see the introduction of Mortgage payments in the Sears catalogs that shows how much more money people are paying when using a loan. With the idea of \u2018monthly like rent\u2019 to push people to pay more for a longer period. A segregated African American during the worst year of the Great Depression, when adjusted to inflation in 2024 was making $7.69 / hour, which is still better than the current $7.25 / hour minimum wage in 2024. The conditions were so bad in the 1930\u2019s that the United enacted the 1938 Act, which put the minimum wage at $0.25 / hour. This quintupled the lowest wage workers from 5 cents to 25 cents / hour. This put the segregated African American at a comfortable $38 / hour, when adjusted to inflation in 1938. In my opinion the United States needs to do this again because we are in the same predicament at the Great Depression with the wages being way too low. 1964 The 1960\u2019s is known as some of the most economically prosperous times in the United States so lets see what life was like during this time period. The minimum wage was now $1.15 / hour due to the 1961 amendment, which is significantly better than $0.40 in the 1930\u2019s - Source In 1965, a new Corvette cost $4,106, which allows us to make a perfect comparison. Lets take the minimum wages of 1964 and 2024 and compare it with the prices of a new corvette for the same years. Minimum Wage: 1964 - $1.15 / hour 2024 - $7.25 / hour New Corvette Price: 1965 - $4,106 2024 - $70,000 For someone making minimum wage in 1965, it would take them 1.7 years to afford a new Corvette. For someone making minimum wage in 2024, it would take them 4.6 years to afford a new Corvette. So with this comparison we can see just how bad the situation is in 2024. Now lets compare the college tuition: The average tuition cost in 1964 for all college institutions was $191 / year. Minimum Wage: 1964 - $1.15 / hour 2024 - $7.25 / hour Tuition Prices: 1965 - $191 / year 2024 - $15,000 / year Since the conditions significantly improved after the Great Depression, it only took 1 month for someone working minimum wage to afford a whole year of tuition in 1964. Someone in 2024, in the same situation, would have to work a whole year just to afford tuition. Now lets compare the housing prices: The average home prices unfortunately kept increasing from the 1930\u2019s to the 1960\u2019s  and ranged from $7000 - $20000. Someone making minimum wage in 1964 only needed 3 years of saving to afford a $7000 house, which is significantly better than the worst year of the Great Depression and especially today. Adjust to inflation the minimum wage felt like $32 / hour in 1964 with an annual salary of $67,000, which should be the case today. 1995 Lets fast forward to 1995 and the 90\u2019s because many economists say this decade was considered another boom decade like the 60\u2019s. The minimum wage at this time was $4.75 / hour, which quadrupled in 30 years. This wasn\u2019t due to the government looking out for its citizens. This was due to the Nixon Shock that took the Dollar off the gold standard and the American Dollar becoming a FIAT currency. Without a backed currency, inflation started to run rampant. The quadrupling of the minimum wage may seem massive but it\u2019s only until you compare it to the other major expenses that Americans have to pay for, the true reality is revealed. For instance college tuition increased from $191 to $4338, a 22x difference from 1964. In 1964, the average price of a new car was around $2000. In 1995, the average price shot up $17,000, which means it increased over 8x. Lets go to housing. If you look at the housing chart from 1964, the median price of house in the 60\u2019s and 90\u2019s is showing. In 1964, the median price of a house was around $15,000 and in 1995, the median price was around $100,000, a 7x difference. As you can see that 4x difference in the minimum wage from 1964 to 1995 actually hurt the citizens. The major expenses in an American citizens life were between 22x - 8x more expensive than in the 1960\u2019s, while the minimum wage stayed at only 4x. The government has failed its people. The government knew these prices were raising significantly but purposely left the minimum wage behind. The thing people need to understand is if the minimum wage is higher than ALL wages will be higher. Greed is the bedrock of America and the people forgot to care about the lowest of the low. Unfortunately 1995 was just the beginning and it gets even worst the next 30 years. The 1990\u2019s is where we see a major turn towards greed from the government and companies but when adjust to inflation the minimum wage felt like making $20 / hour, when comparing it to today\u2019s money. This is still significantly better than 2024 but way less than it\u2019s supposed to be. 2024 In 2024, the minimum wage is $7.25, which is a 6x difference from 1964. The average tuition now costs $15,000, which is a 80x difference from 1964. The average new car price is $47,000, which is 24x difference from 1964. The average price of a new house is $412,300, which is a 28x difference from 1964. Below is an overview of how much money per hour the poorest Americans were making when adjust to inflation during the years we just went over. This was based of the wages and the housing prices of each time period compared with 2024: 1813 \u2014> $416 / hour 1861 \u2014> $139 / hour 1908 \u2014> $104 / hour 1932 \u2014> $7.69 / hour (Segregated African American worker during the worst year of the Great Depression) 1964 \u2014> $32 / hour 1995 \u2014> $20 / hour 2024 \u2014> $7.25 / hour The minimum wage needs be raised to $30 / hour or higher nationally in order for America to fix this problem. The minimum wage needs to be tied to median prices of the biggest American purchases: Housing, Automobile, Tuition, etc. in order to keep life fair for everyone. Do you know see the fundamental problem in the United States? Remember if the government increases the minimum wage to where it should be it fixes all the problems we are seeing. It will force the increase of wages of all citizens to the correct amount. The Great Depression forced a quintupling of the minimum wage but what we are seeing today is the opposite effect. There is no depression / recession. The Stock market is making new highs. The salaries of CEO\u2019s have quintupled since 2020. The top 10 richest people in the world are worth over $200 Billion. What we are seeing is the normalization of poverty. Live paycheck to paycheck is a normal thing. Never owning a house is becoming a normal thing. Taking out life-altering major loans is a normal thing.

The lowest minimum wage is $7.25 / hour, which equals $58 / day, which is shared by many states. The highest minimum wage is $16 / hour, which equals $128 / day, which is the min. wage of California. </p><p>So now lets enforce the 1861 economy into todays prices: </p><p><strong>The common laborer when buying a new vehicle (horse) would only have to pay $580, since a cheap horse was only 10x the amount of his daily work. Today a car is 840x the amount of workers daily work. </strong></p><p>The reason I used the cheap $10 horse in this example is because a car that costs $48,644 today is on the lower end of car prices. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b9-U!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee35f303-8140-45de-8658-e6afc0e28fb4_1084x380.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b9-U!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee35f303-8140-45de-8658-e6afc0e28fb4_1084x380.png\" width=\"1084\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><a href=\"https://libraryguides.missouri.edu/pricesandwages/1860-1869\">Source</a></p><p>The housing situation in the 1860&#8217;s was getting more expensive than that in the 1810&#8217;s, which is a pattern we will continue to see as we get closer to the present day. </p><p>Remember that as of August 9, 2024, the median price of an existing single-family home in the United States was $432,700. That&#8217;s still 1000 times the cost of houses back in 1813. But that&#8217;s because of inflation so lets compare the wage to housing prices to get a better idea: </p><p>Today, it is literally impossible for a minimum wage worker to afford a house. Making only $58 / day it would take them over 30 years just to collect the funds to buy a house. This is of course if this worker didn&#8217;t miss one of the 270  work days in a year and never took a vacation. </p><p><strong>Back in 1860 on the $1 / day wage, it would only take someone 1.5 years to afford a $400 house. Life was affordable for even the lowest paying worker in the past. </strong></p><p><strong>Here&#8217;s a better way to look at it. In order for someone to pay for a $432,700 house in 1.5 years, like in 1860, the minimum wage can&#8217;t be lower than $288,466 / year. Think about that.

Many people in 1908 were being payed less than $3 a week. So lets see how long it would take them to afford a cheap house of $300. Since it&#8217;s easy math, it would take 100 weeks (2 years) for a low paying wage to afford a cheap house. </p><p><strong>This is significantly better than the situation in 2024. The cheapest houses today sell for around $200,000. Remember the minimum wage worker makes $58 / day, which translates into $290 / week. </strong></p><p><strong>This means it would take them 13 years to afford the cheapest house, which is significantly worse than the poorest of the poor immigrants who moved to American in the early 1900s. </strong></p><p>1908 was also the year the Ford Model T came out and when automobiles became the favorite transportation tool for the wealthy.

Remember if the government increases the minimum wage to where it should be it fixes all the problems we are seeing. It will force the increase of wages of all citizens to the correct amount. </p><p>The Great Depression forced a quintupling of the minimum wage but what we are seeing today is the opposite effect. There is no depression / recession. The Stock market is making new highs. The salaries of CEO&#8217;s have quintupled since 2020. The top 10 richest people in the world are worth over $200 Billion. </p><p>What we are seeing is the normalization of poverty. Live paycheck to paycheck is a normal thing.

Around the corner, another Cuban man helped customers at a fruit stand. A third danced on the sidewalk during a break from work. The U.S. government deported all three of these men to Mexico, and the Mexican government then bused them to Villahermosa, a town a couple of hours from the Guatemalan border in the state of Tabasco. They were now surviving by working under the table at the market since they did not have any status to live or work in the country. The Trump administration has sought agreements with countries to accept people of other nationalities who are being deported by the U.S. That has meant sending more than 230 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they spent months in a notorious prison. The administration has also deported small groups of people to the African countries of Eswatini and South Sudan , among others, though the deportees are not from those places. And, it has sent people from several Western Hemisphere countries, including Cuba and Nicaragua, to Mexico. Many of the deportees are past retirement age and had lived in the U.S. for decades. The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to Capital & Main\u2019s requests for comment. It\u2019s not clear how many people Mexico has received. Though the country regularly publishes statistics about its own deported nationals, it does not release data on other nationalities deported from the U.S. In July, President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country had received 6,525 deportees of other nationalities. Though Mexico receives these deportees, it does not give them any legal status to live or work there. The Mexican government did not respond to a request for comment. According to human rights observers with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights and the Institute for Women in Migration, or IMUMI, Mexico sends these third-country deportees to Villahermosa. With a population of just under 834,000 people, according to data from the Mexican government, Villahermosa has only one migrant shelter. Many of the deportees are past retirement age and had lived in the U.S. for decades, which presents unique challenges for the shelter, said Josue Leal, coordinator at the Oasis de Paz Del Esp\u00edritu Santo Amparito. Many end up living on the street because they can\u2019t find enough work to pay rent, said several Cuban men working in the Villahermosa market. Those with family still in the U.S. often lean on their loved ones for support. Louis Robaina, second from right, works at a fruit stand at a market in Villahermosa. Robaina was deported to Mexico after Cuba refused to take him back. \u201cLost in This Country\u201d People deported to Mexico who are not from there told Capital & Main they were taken by bus to the border and crossed south at various points from Tijuana, adjacent to San Diego, to Reynosa, across the Rio Grande from McAllen, Texas. Then, Mexican officials put them on another bus to Villahermosa, a trip that can take up to 40 hours, depending on the crossing point. The bus arrives at an immigration detention center, and eventually Mexican immigration officials release the deportees to figure out where to go next. One man said the authorities sent him out into the street around 11 p.m. \u201cNo Nicaraguan who has been in the United States can return.\u201d On an afternoon in late September, three people walked out of the detention center after being held there. Among them was a Nicaraguan man who said he\u2019d spent about 40 years in the U.S. \u2014 since he was a teenager. He asked not to be identified due to his vulnerable situation. He said he has children and grandchildren in California, and he learned that his permanent residency had expired when ICE officers arrested him while he was at court to pay a traffic ticket. He spent several months at the Otay Mesa Detention Center east of San Diego, he said, before seeing a judge who told him he had to leave the U.S. He\u2019d been deported and bused to Villahermosa two months earlier but had ended up being detained a second time when he tried to board a plane to Nicaragua because his home country refused to accept him, he said. \u201cNo Nicaraguan who has been in the United States can return,\u201d he said in Spanish. The man said that it was especially hot inside the Mexican detention center but that otherwise he\u2019d been treated well enough. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to do next. \u201cI\u2019m lost in this country,\u201d he said. In early November, he told Capital & Main over the phone that he\u2019d finally reached Nicaragua by sneaking into the country, but he hoped to return to the U.S. before long one way or another. A Second Chance Many of the third-country nationals deported to Mexico are Cubans who had green cards to live permanently in the U.S., but the government took those away after they were convicted of crimes. That\u2019s what happened to Louis Robaina, who was working at a fruit stand that afternoon at the market in Villahermosa. He spent six years in prison after a fraud and money laundering conviction in Miami, he said. A father to three U.S. citizen children, he said that while he was in prison, he worked as a teacher helping other inmates get their GED diplomas and that he never had any disciplinary issues. \u201cSometimes you make mistakes, and you have to know that sometimes people need a second chance,\u201d Robaina said. Instead of a second chance, he was transferred to immigration custody after prison, and a judge denied his request for protection from deportation to Cuba. Still, Cuba refused to take him back. He ended up in Villahermosa at the beginning of summer. \u201cSometimes you make mistakes, and you have to know that sometimes people need a second chance.\u201d His family has been helping him while he gets on his feet, he said. He applied for asylum in Mexico and is waiting for the next steps in the process. He said his family members supported President Donald Trump until this happened. Now they have all changed their minds. \u201cWe thought that he was good for the country,\u201d Robaina said. \u201cHe\u2019s a piece of shit.\u201d Damian De La Moneda said that in some ways he sees his deportation to Mexico as a second chance, a new start. \u201cThis is good for me in a way,\u201d he said. Like Robaina, De La Moneda, who arrived in Villahermosa in September, found himself deported after a criminal conviction, even though that conviction happened more than 20 years ago, he said. The 49-year-old moved to the U.S. from Cuba as a child, and he said he fell in with the wrong crowd and ended up in prison. He was ordered deported around 2001, he said, but because of the lack of relationship between the U.S. and Cuba at the time, he stayed in Miami and got his life together. Damian De La Moneda at the Oasis de Paz Del Esp\u00edritu Santo Amparito shelter in Villahermosa. The 49-year-old found himself deported after a decades-old criminal conviction. \u201cNow, I know the difference between right and wrong,\u201d he said. He began working with a Christian ministry in 2017, he said. When he was traveling through Texas, police pulled him over, and because his license was expired, detained him, he said. He was then taken into ICE custody. ICE officers tried to talk him into agreeing to go to Mexico. He said no and started the process to file a habeas petition to challenge his continued time in custody. ICE sent him to Mexico anyway. Court records show that the federal court in the Southern District of Texas did not process his application until after he had arrived in Villahermosa. He learned about the Amparito shelter and made his way there. He was working on applying for asylum in Mexico and finding work so that he could get his own place. He struggled with the shelter\u2019s lack of air conditioning in the humid heat of Villahermosa. While he\u2019s found silver linings in his situation, he said he still would rather be in the U.S., where his mother and the woman he intended to marry one day both live. Extended Stays While the Amparito shelter usually allows migrants to stay for only three days, coordinator Leal said that with reduced demand from fewer people heading north, and the complexities the deportees face in finding other lodging, the shelter has extended their stays. That\u2019s especially true for a group of older Cuban men who all spent several decades living in the U.S. Leal said the shelter is facing extra challenges helping them because several have chronic health conditions. Angel Insua, 65, said he has diabetes and high blood pressure. One of his legs doesn\u2019t work well, and he\u2019s losing his vision, he said. After living in Florida for about 45 years, Angel Insua, 65, was deported \u2014 in chains, he said \u2014 and is now a resident of the Amparito shelter. He lived in Orlando, Florida, for about 45 years, he said, but had his green card taken away after he served a prison sentence decades ago. \u201cThey deported me from there to here,\u201d Insua said in Spanish. \u201cThey treated me like \u2014 I never thought the United States would treat me in that way.\u201d \u201cI have a brave heart to keep going, but I am still weak.\u201d He said officials took his money and his ring and that he was chained throughout the deportation process. Insua said he would like to apply for asylum, but he can\u2019t see well enough to walk to the refugee agency without falling and injuring himself. He was grateful to have a place to sleep at the shelter, but he didn\u2019t know how long it would last. Arturo, a 64-year-old who declined to give his last name because of his vulnerable situation, said he had agreed to go to Mexico to avoid going back to Cuba after ICE arrested him in Florida. He too had old convictions that had cost him his green card. He said he has sciatica that causes him a lot of pain, high blood pressure, epilepsy and chronic asthma. \u201cI have a brave heart to keep going, but I am still weak,\u201d he said in Spanish. Arturo was deported without a phone and was trying to get his sister\u2019s number. He said he hoped his family would help him rent a place because he was running out of time at the shelter. Arturo, 64, said he agreed to go to Mexico to avoid going back to Cuba after ICE arrested him in Florida, but his time was running out at the Amparito shelter. Fidel Forten-Garcia, 66, said he was also deported without his phone and struggling to communicate with family. He wanted to be able to talk with his children, he said. \u201cI\u2019m still thinking that I\u2019m dreaming \u2014 it\u2019s like a nightmare,\u201d Forten-Garcia said, saying the last word in English. He said he\u2019s having a hard time getting medication for his health issues, including high blood pressure. Forten-Garcia spent time in prison, followed by time in immigration custody, throughout his life, he said. Though a judge took away his green card, immigration officials had to release him each time because Cuba would not take him back. He is worried about starting over again, though he still feels strong enough to work, he said. He didn\u2019t understand what had happened to him, he said several times. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will ever understand.\u201d Enduring and Waiting Not every Cuban whom the U.S. has deported to Mexico has a criminal record. Yamil, the man working delivering jugs of water at the market, said he had come to the U.S. to request protection from Cuba, but he lost his asylum case in 2017. Because he couldn\u2019t be deported to Cuba, he kept living in Texas, checking in with ICE periodically. He fell in love with a U.S. citizen and married her after they\u2019d been together for about five years, he said. They\u2019ve been married now for about three years. But he said an attorney told him that in order to get a green card through his wife, he would have to leave the U.S. and ask for a pardon for the time that he spent there without status. Yamil loads jugs of water onto a tricycle for delivery in Villahermosa. The Cuban man lost his case for asylum and said he was told by an attorney that to get a green card through his U.S.-born wife, he would have to leave the U.S. and ask for a pardon. When he showed up for his last check-in appointment, he said, officers detained him and told him they were transferring him to another detention center. He soon found himself on Mexican soil. \u201cThe United States is very good on many things and very bad on various things,\u201d he said in Spanish. Yamil was worried about his debt accumulating in the U.S. while he\u2019s earning low wages in pesos. He still had a credit card and bank account in the U.S., he said, as though he never left. He had started getting calls from creditors, he said. He said he\u2019s trying to be a productive member of society in Mexico, just as he did in the U.S. He talks to his wife every day. He still hopes to be able to return to his life with her. \u201cI have to endure,\u201d he said. \u201cOne has to wait.\u201d Copyright 2025 Capital & Main. This story was supported with a Charles M.

Europe is not behaving like a serious geopolitical actor. By the middle of 2023, the signs were already clear that the war was developing according to a difficult trajectory. I remember privately raising questions about what a Ukrainian defeat would mean for Europe. Admittedly, I was doing it because I hoped that by examining the consequences, European leaders would change their approach. I still hope that. Back then, those conversations were often dismissed or treated as a kind of political contamination. Policymakers preferred to congratulate themselves for proving Russia wrong about Western fickleness. But Russia was right: Western resolve was exactly as fragile as Moscow believed. Bluntly, even in 2022 we only supported Ukrainians because they fought like  heroes from Norse myth and got results. We didn\u2019t support them because it was the morally right thing to do. In the interim, I have struggled to find any deep and serious internal government work on what happens if Ukraine loses. Instead, everyone is busy playing fantasy ceasefire, sometimes with even more absurd questions about \u2018post-Ukraine Russia\u2019. Like me, European officials are very good at complaining. They complain about Washington. They complain about Kyiv. They complain about each other. But complaint is not policy. Action is. Europe refuses to use frozen Russian assets. It refuses to commit to sustained mass-scale financing for Ukrainian defence production. It refuses to engage with viable plans like even a partial SkyShield. It refuses to confront the political costs of real support. The so-called coalition of the willing is willing to do absolutely nothing of any importance. Defence budgets rise in theory  and get spent on nonsense we can only pray will work. Meanwhile, Ukrainian factories - or those unlucky enough not to be fuelling the rampant corruption around the Office of the President - live hand to mouth. There is continual battlefield innovation that is never scaled, or is scaled only in Russia. Europe needs to deliver massive R&D investments into the only country that knows how to fight: Ukraine. Unfortunately, wars aren\u2019t won by issuing statements of concern. Europe is a spectator to its own security Ukraine desperately needs a ceasefire, but not the ones Russia (via Witkoff or not) is offering. The country is exhausted; manpower is worryingly low; trust in military administration (as opposed to the heroes fighting) is thin. Everyone hates the Territorial Recruitment Centres that take men from the street. Kyiv\u2019s internal problems, including serious alleged and proven corruption around the Office of the President, make the situation harder. These are all the more reason Europe must step up and apply some muscle, not step back. Meanwhile, Washington is an embarrassing circus. Nobody knows what is going on and Floridian realtors rewrite treaties and thirty-year-long security architectures via the Google Translate function. I have had sympathy for European efforts  to court Trump on the assumption that they were buying much-needed time (admittedly after a good decade and a half of ignoring  U.S. presidents telling us they were pivoting from Europe) to develop and implement a strategy. In fairness, there are sprouting signs of strategy but that isn\u2019t enough. Too much, including PURL has largely been reactive to the U.S.\u2019 whims. Nobody believes in their own charm as much as a Western European diplomat so perhaps some officials really thought they might win the U.S. around. For the rest, it is probably a more basic case of avoidance dressed up as diplomacy. In their talks with Secretary Rubio, the Ukrainians didn\u2019t bother discussing the European counter plan. And why should they? Europe has allowed itself to be sidelined to the point where its own security is now being negotiated without it. A better plan is possible, of course, one that protects Ukrainian sovereignty and European security. But it requires Europe to pay actual costs, political, financial, and strategic, and Europe is not willing to do that, or not enough European leaders are. Too many European governments still behave as if losing Ukraine would be unfortunate but manageable. This is fantasy. The destruction of Ukraine would reshape Europe\u2019s security architecture for decades, and not in Europe\u2019s favour. Nothing about Europe\u2019s position today was inevitable. It is the product of decisions not taken, responsibilities avoided, and illusions clung to for too long. It is the product of arrogance, of not realising Ukraine is the only security guarantee this continent has, and of a bizarre teleological liberalism that sees liberal democracy has somehow feted to win out according to the laws of history. If Europe continues down this path, a settlement will eventually be imposed that reflects the interests of Putin and whichever Americans happen to be influential at that moment.

Your phone is a fake house \u2014 in The wooden stairs in my childhood home had a creaky step. I can still vividly picture the way it groaned under pressure. It was such a loud, incriminating sound that I would usually hop over it on my midnight runs to the kitchen. Otherwise, I would wake the entire house. It takes an incredibly intimate familiarity to develop that kind of habit. Once you really start knowing a place, you develop your own navigational idiosyncrasies like that. My roommate says he would always grab the railing in a particular way when walking upstairs in his childhood home. I also see myself developing unique behaviors in the digital space. Only I have the motor memory to immediately open the notes app on my phone. A stranger would have to look for it, but my fingers subconsciously understand where to go. Much like with my childhood home, I have an embodied knowledge of my home screen. That phrase\u2014\u201chome screen\u201d\u2014has been on my mind recently. The language of the smartphone invites you to think of it as a house. You can \u201cchoose your wallpaper,\u201d just like with a real house; you can \u201clock\u201d your phone like a front door. The metaphor is that this is a private refuge from the outside world. It is a tiny dwelling in your pocket, which you can customize like an actual dwelling to affirm your identity. In doing so, you \u201ctame\u201d the technology, making it feel natural in your everyday life. The phone, like your house, is a focal point. Everything revolves around it. When you need comfort in the physical world, you go back to the home; in the digital world, you go back to your home screen. There is something calming about a deeply personal environment. It provides a grounding presence which we can retreat to. A computer, meanwhile, remains more functional. Phrases like \u201cdesktop\u201d and \u201ctaskbar\u201d create a metaphor that this is a workstation; you have \u201ctrash\u201d and \u201cfiles.\u201d Of course, there are still work-like aspects to the phone and home-like aspects to the computer, but the phone takes on a far more domestic role in our lives. It is not a utility: it is an extension of self. In his book The Poetics of Space, the philosopher Gaston Bachelard argues that our intimate spaces are deeply intertwined with our imagination and sense of being. When you curl up in a comfortable nook in your home, for example, your consciousness is gathered inward. You have control over this small space, in contrast to the wild, turbulent outdoors. You can focus attention differently in miniature. As I move between apps on my phone, I notice a vague emotion that I am entering different rooms, each with its own character. The settings app is the basement; the dating apps are the bedroom. No matter where I go, though, there is that coziness of being in a nook. This is my corner of the world; I am free to do what I want. I can let my mind relax, for I am safe and secure from the vast, terrifying world. Of course, phones only give us the illusion of privacy and control. If apps are rooms, then every room in your house has someone peeking through the blinds. And you might be able to customize your experience to some degree, but automatic updates are a reminder that you don\u2019t really have agency over your cute little space. Keep reading PHOTOGRAPHY \u201cMacy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, USA\u201d by Elliott Erwitt, 1988, shared by Alex COMICS Peanuts theology Steven D. Greydanus explores the biblical influences on Charles Schulz\u2019s 50-year meditation on suffering, baseball, and childhood. \u2018Peanuts\u2019: Suffering, baseball, and religion \u2014 in Schulz wrote and drew Peanuts for nearly a half century\u2014and, while it\u2019s widely agreed that his creative peak was from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, the singular sensibility, ruthless brilliance, and empathy that characterized his work was present from the beginning to the end. Schulz\u2019s 50-year run has been called \u201carguably the longest story ever told by one human being\u201d; it is too rich and varied a body of work to be encapsulated in a single strip. When I think of Peanuts, among many other things, I think of . . . Snoopy\u2019s fantasy life; Charlie Brown haplessly seeking psychiatric help from Lucy, and even more haplessly trying to kick Lucy\u2019s football; Peppermint Patty consistently pulling D-minuses, and Charlie Brown regularly getting his socks and various other articles of clothing knocked off him by line drives in one losing baseball game after another; and various unrequited loves (Sally adores Linus, who crushes on Miss Othmar; Lucy is fascinated with Schroeder; and both Peppermint Patty and Marcie are sweet on Charlie Brown, who, of course, is infatuated with the Little Red-Haired Girl). I also think of allusions to and quotations from various literary sources: Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll, Tolstoy, Mark Twain, Scott Fitzgerald, and many others. Above all, the Bible, most often quoted by Linus, though it\u2019s also referenced by Lucy, Charlie Brown, Sally, and even Snoopy. The Bible has a lot to say about evil and suffering, of course, and suffering is a major theme in Peanuts. All of the bulleted themes above include disappointment, hardship, and suffering. Even in Snoopy\u2019s fantasy life, the World War I Flying Ace often had the worse of his encounters with the Red Baron, and the World Famous Writer\u2019s literary efforts were generally rebuffed by publishers. Unsurprisingly, Schulz repeatedly referenced the book of Job, which is all about the problem of evil. (He also turned more than once to Ecclesiastes.) The Sunday strip below, from September 1967, embraces Schulz\u2019s preoccupations with baseball, suffering and loss, theology, and the Bible, particularly the book of Job; I know of no one Peanuts strip that sums up more of Schulz\u2019s sensibility than this. Keep reading WAITING FOR BECKETT FILM Not like the other girls Marion Teniade on the role that turned rom-com rules on their head: Julia Roberts as Jules in My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding. Character Study: Jules from My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding \u2014 in The titans of the \u201990s rom-com\u2014the household names who held the title of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweetheart\u201d at various points during the era\u2014each had their signature thing. A Meg Ryan character, for example, was gonna be perky, and kind of fussy, and seem like she read a lot of books. A Sandra Bullock character was often lonely, surprisingly goofy, and the most likely to join a game of flag football. A Drew Barrymore character would inevitably be painfully earnest and also possibly a little bit high. Julia Roberts\u2019s thing\u2014apart from The Smile, and The Hair, and The Laugh\u2014was that her characters were not like the other girls. Whereas other rom-com heroines of the time were cuddly and and effectively sexless, you could count on a Julia Roberts lead to be emotionally evasive and have a sex life that featured as an active plot point in the movie (if not the entire plot itself). And no movie better exemplifies that than My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding . In My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding , Roberts plays Jules Potter, a 27-year-old food critic who gets an unexpected call from her best friend, Michael (played by Dermot Mulroney): Michael, a sports journalist who\u2019s carried a torch for Julie since they briefly dated in college, is getting married. Hearing the news makes Jules realize that, actually, she\u2019s in love with him, and so now she has no choice but to fly to Chicago and win back her man who isn\u2019t actually her man (all while unexpectedly serving as maid of honor to Michael\u2019s college-age fianc\u00e9e). It\u2019s a classic, very Katharine Hepburn-coded screwball premise. And if another rom-com star had the leading role\u2014Renee Zellweger, perhaps\u2014everything would\u2019ve been different. Jules would\u2019ve been a good-hearted magazine columnist who went by her full name (Julianne). Michael would\u2019ve been an emotionally stunted playboy who needed to realize that the woman of his dreams was actually the one who\u2019d been standing in front of him for years. And his fianc\u00e9e would\u2019ve been an uptight career woman who might\u2019ve been sexy and powerful but couldn\u2019t make him laugh the way Julianne did. But Jules isn\u2019t a Zellweger character. Or an anyone-else character. She\u2019s a Julia Roberts character. And that means things are gonna [get] riled up.

That is, what you want is not \u2018Tis but \u2019Tis There are any number of methods to accomplish this jaunty apostrophe, but the method I use, because it\u2019s easiest for me to recall and execute, is to type x\u2019Tis and then delete the x, leaving me with a pretty and correct \u2019Tis. Both easy and peasy, yes? \u2019Tis also the season to remind yourself how to properly address holiday cards being dispatched to families, which is to say, \u2019tis also the season to remember how to pluralize family names. Many surnames can be pluralized with the typical pluralizing s, so that Smith becomes Smiths (The Smiths!), Brown becomes Browns (The Browns!), Jackson becomes Jacksons (The Jacksons!), etc. Do of course remember that the rule you learned back in elementary school about how to pluralize generic words ending in y (e.g., party \u2192 parties) does not apply here, and the plural of, for instance, Kennedy is not Kennedies but Kennedys. So far, so good? Moving on to s- or z-ending surnames, your holiday card making its way to a number of people named Jones is addressed to the Joneses, that bunch of people called Collins are the Collinses, a bevy of people yclept Hernandez are the Hernandezes, etc. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are, of course, the Marches, because \u201cMarchs\u201d would be weird-looking. You got this. Beyond that, if you\u2019re consumed with anxiety in attempting to pluralize a name that seems to defy pluralization by any logical or aesthetically pleasing means, do of course remember that you can always address M. et Mme.

I can still vividly picture the way it groaned under pressure. It was such a loud, incriminating sound that I would usually hop over it on my midnight runs to the kitchen. Otherwise, I would wake the entire house.</p><p>It takes an incredibly intimate familiarity to develop that kind of habit. Once you really start knowing a place, you develop your own navigational idiosyncrasies like that. My roommate says he would always grab the railing in a particular way when walking upstairs in his childhood home.</p><p>I also see myself developing unique behaviors in the digital space. Only I have the motor memory to immediately open the notes app on my phone. A stranger would have to look for it, but my fingers subconsciously understand where to go. Much like with my childhood home, I have an embodied knowledge of my home screen.</p><p>That phrase&#8212;&#8220;home screen&#8221;&#8212;has been on my mind recently. The language of the smartphone invites you to think of it as a house. You can &#8220;choose your wallpaper,&#8221; just like with a real house; you can &#8220;lock&#8221; your phone like a front door. The metaphor is that this is a private refuge from the outside world. It is a tiny dwelling in your pocket, which you can customize like an actual dwelling to affirm your identity. In doing so, you &#8220;tame&#8221; the technology, making it feel natural in your everyday life.</p><p>The phone, like your house, is a focal point. Everything revolves around it. When you need comfort in the physical world, you go back to the home; in the digital world, you go back to your home screen. There is something calming about a deeply personal environment. It provides a grounding presence which we can retreat to.</p><p>A computer, meanwhile, remains more functional. Phrases like &#8220;desktop&#8221; and &#8220;taskbar&#8221; create a metaphor that this is a workstation; you have &#8220;trash&#8221; and &#8220;files.&#8221; Of course, there are still work-like aspects to the phone and home-like aspects to the computer, but the phone takes on a far more domestic role in our lives. It is not a utility: it is an extension of self.</p><p>In his book The Poetics of Space, the philosopher Gaston Bachelard argues that our intimate spaces are deeply intertwined with our imagination and sense of being. When you curl up in a comfortable nook in your home, for example, your consciousness is gathered inward. You have control over this small space, in contrast to the wild, turbulent outdoors. You can focus attention differently in miniature.</p><p>As I move between apps on my phone, I notice a vague emotion that I am entering different rooms, each with its own character. The settings app is the basement; the dating apps are the bedroom. No matter where I go, though, there is that coziness of being in a nook. This is my corner of the world; I am free to do what I want. I can let my mind relax, for I am safe and secure from the vast, terrifying world.</p><p>Of course, phones only give us the illusion of privacy and control. If apps are rooms, then every room in your house has someone peeking through the blinds. And you might be able to customize your experience to some degree, but automatic updates are a reminder that you don&#8217;t really have agency over your cute little space.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://etymology.substack.com/p/your-phone-is-a-fake-house\">Keep reading</a></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8jS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51f0f79-448c-4be4-80b7-77757c5affa7_1184x280.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"59.12162162162162\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8jS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51f0f79-448c-4be4-80b7-77757c5affa7_1184x280.png\" width=\"250\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><h5><em>PHOTOGRAPHY</em></h5><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!17_A!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b789141-352a-4865-9aa0-3650ee43bbd4_750x1000.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"813.3333333333334\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!17_A!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b789141-352a-4865-9aa0-3650ee43bbd4_750x1000.png\" width=\"610\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><em>&#8220;Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, USA&#8221; by Elliott Erwitt, 1988, shared by <a href=\"https://substack.com/@1800vintage/note/c-181890561?utm_source=notes-share-action&amp;r=48ea6r\">Alex</a></em></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_b6s!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff254cb24-2f66-42f9-a1d7-681d80bae023_1184x280.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"61.013513513513516\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_b6s!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff254cb24-2f66-42f9-a1d7-681d80bae023_1184x280.png\" width=\"258\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><h5><em>COMICS</em></h5><h3><strong>Peanuts theology</strong></h3><p>Steven D.

Schulz&#8217;s 50-year run has been called &#8220;arguably the longest story ever told by one human being&#8221;; it is too rich and varied a body of work to be encapsulated in a single strip. When I think of Peanuts, among many other things, I think of . . .</p><ul><li><p>Snoopy&#8217;s fantasy life;</p></li><li><p>Charlie Brown haplessly seeking psychiatric help from Lucy, and even more haplessly trying to kick Lucy&#8217;s football;</p></li><li><p>Peppermint Patty consistently pulling D-minuses, and Charlie Brown regularly getting his socks and various other articles of clothing knocked off him by line drives in one losing baseball game after another; and</p></li><li><p>various unrequited loves (Sally adores Linus, who crushes on Miss Othmar; Lucy is fascinated with Schroeder; and both Peppermint Patty and Marcie are sweet on Charlie Brown, who, of course, is infatuated with the Little Red-Haired Girl).</p></li></ul><p>I also think of allusions to and quotations from various literary sources: Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll, Tolstoy, Mark Twain, Scott Fitzgerald, and many others. Above all, the Bible, most often quoted by Linus, though it&#8217;s also referenced by Lucy, Charlie Brown, Sally, and even Snoopy.</p><p>The Bible has a lot to say about evil and suffering, of course, and suffering is a major theme in Peanuts. All of the bulleted themes above include disappointment, hardship, and suffering. Even in Snoopy&#8217;s fantasy life, the World War I Flying Ace often had the worse of his encounters with the Red Baron, and the World Famous Writer&#8217;s literary efforts were generally rebuffed by publishers.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Schulz repeatedly referenced the book of Job, which is all about the problem of evil. (He also turned more than once to Ecclesiastes.) The Sunday strip below, from September 1967, embraces Schulz&#8217;s preoccupations with baseball, suffering and loss, theology, and the Bible, particularly the book of Job; I know of no one Peanuts strip that sums up more of Schulz&#8217;s sensibility than this.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\"

href=\"https://goodmovie.substack.com/p/character-study-jules-from-my-best?r=48ea6r&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true\">Character Study: Jules from My Best Friend&#8217;s Wedding</a></strong></h3><p>&#8212;<span class=\"mention-wrap\"></span> in <span class=\"mention-wrap\"></span> </p><blockquote><p>The titans of the &#8217;90s rom-com&#8212;the household names who held the title of &#8220;America&#8217;s Sweetheart&#8221; at various points during the era&#8212;each had their signature thing. A Meg Ryan character, for example, was gonna be perky, and kind of fussy, and seem like she read a lot of books. A Sandra Bullock character was often lonely, surprisingly goofy, and the most likely to join a game of flag football. A Drew Barrymore character would inevitably be painfully earnest and also possibly a little bit high.</p><p>Julia Roberts&#8217;s thing&#8212;apart from The Smile, and The Hair, and The Laugh&#8212;was that her characters were not like the other girls. Whereas other rom-com heroines of the time were cuddly and and effectively sexless, you could count on a Julia Roberts lead to be emotionally evasive and have a sex life that featured as an active plot point in the movie (if not the entire plot itself). And no movie better exemplifies that than <em>My Best Friend&#8217;s Wedding</em>.</p><p>In <em>My Best Friend&#8217;s Wedding</em>, Roberts plays Jules Potter, a 27-year-old food critic who gets an unexpected call from her best friend, Michael (played by Dermot Mulroney): Michael, a sports journalist who&#8217;s carried a torch for Julie since they briefly dated in college, is getting married. Hearing the news makes Jules realize that, actually, she&#8217;s in love with him, and so now she has no choice but to fly to Chicago and win back her man who isn&#8217;t actually her man (all while unexpectedly serving as maid of honor to Michael&#8217;s college-age fianc&#233;e). It&#8217;s a classic, very Katharine Hepburn-coded screwball premise. And if another rom-com star had the leading role&#8212;Renee Zellweger, perhaps&#8212;everything would&#8217;ve been different.</p><p>Jules would&#8217;ve been a good-hearted magazine columnist who went by her full name (Julianne). Michael would&#8217;ve been an emotionally stunted playboy who needed to realize that the woman of his dreams was actually the one who&#8217;d been standing in front of him for years. And his fianc&#233;e would&#8217;ve been an uptight career woman who might&#8217;ve been sexy and powerful but couldn&#8217;t make him laugh the way Julianne did.</p><p>But Jules isn&#8217;t a Zellweger character. Or an anyone-else character. She&#8217;s a Julia Roberts character. And that means things are gonna [get] riled up.</p></blockquote><p><a

most wonderful time of the year &#127926;</a></strong></h3><p>&#8212;<span class=\"mention-wrap\"></span> in <span class=\"mention-wrap\"></span> </p><blockquote><p>&#8217;Tis the season to, if you&#8217;re writing &#8220;&#8217;Tis the season,&#8221; which you should absolutely not do, not in a headline, not in a lede, not in a caption, not in the cover tagline for your Xmas-themed rom-com novel, remember that if you want to write a correct &#8220;&#8217;Tis the season&#8221; you need to figure out how to type a correct word-opening apostrophe rather than, as will happen if you simply start banging away at your keyboard keys willy-nilly, a single open quotation mark.</p><p>That is, what you want is not</p><p>&#8216;Tis</p><p>but</p><p>&#8217;Tis</p><p>There are any number of methods to accomplish this jaunty apostrophe, but the method I use, because it&#8217;s easiest for me to recall and execute, is to type x&#8217;Tis and then delete the x, leaving me with a pretty and correct &#8217;Tis.</p><p>Both easy and peasy, yes?</p><p>&#8217;Tis also the season to remind yourself how to properly address holiday cards being dispatched to families, which is to say, &#8217;tis also the season to remember how to pluralize family names.</p><p>Many surnames can be pluralized with the typical pluralizing s, so that Smith becomes Smiths (The Smiths!), Brown becomes Browns (The Browns!), Jackson becomes Jacksons (The Jacksons!), etc.</p><p>Do of course remember that the rule you learned back in elementary school about how to pluralize generic words ending in y (e.g., party &#8594; parties) does not apply here, and the plural of, for instance, Kennedy is not Kennedies but Kennedys.</p><p>So far, so good?</p><p>Moving on to s- or z-ending surnames, your holiday card making its way to a number of people named Jones is addressed to the Joneses, that bunch of people called Collins are the Collinses, a bevy of people yclept Hernandez are the Hernandezes, etc.</p><p>Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are, of course, the Marches, because &#8220;Marchs&#8221; would be weird-looking.</p><p>You got this.</p><p>Beyond that, if you&#8217;re consumed with anxiety in attempting to pluralize a name that seems to defy pluralization by any logical or aesthetically pleasing means, do of course remember that you can always address M. et Mme. Molyneux and the rest of Molyneux clan as:</p><p>The Molyneux Family</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://benjamindreyer.substack.com/p/the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year\">Keep reading</a></p><div

        "full_content": "A new report finds that U.S. arms contractors\u2019 revenues are surging, even as their programs are late and over budget, undermining military planning and drawing funds and resources away from other government priorities. Released today, the new fact sheet by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) finds that 39 U.S. weapons companies among the world\u2019s 100 largest arms-producing companies , collectively saw their revenues go up by 3.8% to reach $334 billion in 2024, boosted by countries\u2019 weapons modernization efforts, and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. The largest U.S. companies, Lockheed Martin, RTX, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics, all saw increased arms revenues in 2024. Meanwhile the cost increases and delays among key U.S. weapons programs, like the F-35 fighter jet, the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) nuclear weapons program, and Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines, appear to be out of control. The Columbia-class submarine program, for example, is running about 16 months behind schedule and is $17 billion over budget \u2014 lining the pockets of manufacturer General Dynamics, whose revenues went up 8.1% in 2024. The F-35 program delays boosted Lockheed Martin\u2019s 3.2% arms revenue increase last year, where F-35s to be delivered in 2023 came later, especially because of hardware and software-related production setbacks. Northrop Grumman\u2019s revenues jumped by 3.3%, to $37.9 billion in 2024, as production costs for its troubled Sentinel program skyrocketed to an estimated $141 billion \u2014 over 80% over original budget projections. SIPRI researchers say these issues mar U.S. military planning, where these delays and cost overruns can divert government resources from other programs. \u201cThe delays and rising costs [of these programs] will inevitably impact U.S. military planning and military spending,\u201d said Xiao Liang, a researcher at SIPRI\u2019s Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. \u201cThis could have knock-on effects on the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to cut excessive military spending and improve budget efficiency.\u201d SIPRI also found that these delays and cost overruns may worsen in the future, as companies say restricted access to critical minerals, because of new Chinese export controls on some of them, may hamper their ability to make weapons systems on time.",

        "full_content": "Fishermen at Sea, by J. M. W. Turner, 1796. There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. \u2014Herman Melville I quoted that sentence in the toast I delivered at the farewell dinner we held for Lewis Lapham on a December evening two years ago. On that December evening, the Quarterly \u2019s publishing hiatus had just begun. The podcast had fallen silent the previous August. The Energy issue, ready to ship to the printer since the previous June, remained on hold, as did the Quarterly' \u2018s future. Its editorial staff, furloughed, still harbored some hope that the furlough might soon end; that Lewis Lapham might yet carry on. He intended to. Even then, bound for a retirement community in Florida, he had not given up. The Quarterly \u2019s staff had learned to edit remotely during the pandemic, after all. It could be done. Ishmael makes his distinction between the two kinds of woe\u2014one wise, the other mad\u2014in the middle of a dark night. Standing watch at the Pequod \u2019s helm, hand on the ship\u2019s \u201cjawbone tiller,\u201d he nods off a moment, and when he comes to, he has lost his bearings in the literal sense of the phrase; the ship\u2019s compass, lit by a binnacle lamp, has vanished. \u201cNothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness,\u201d he says. \u201cUppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me.\u201d Gathering his wits and then his whereabouts, he realizes that while dozing off, he\u2019d turned about so that he was now facing aft, staring out beyond the Pequod\u2019 s stern into the jet gloom of the Pacific. The \u201cflashes of redness\u201d? Reflections of the fires of the try-works into which the Pequod \u2019s crew had fed strips of blubber, rendering them into oil. Just in time to \u201cprevent the vessel from flying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her,\u201d Ishmael reorients himself.  \u201cHow glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night,\u201d he says. In the manner of Father Mapple finishing a sermon, Ishmael concludes the passage and the chapter with a series of exhortations and linked analogies: \u201cTurn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright . . .\u201d He does not end there, on this sunny note, however. He gives his linked analogies a final turn, one that inverts the order of the phrases in my epigraph: There is a woe that is madness, yes, and that mad woe resembles an \u201cunnatural hallucination of the night\u201d\u2014the gleams of firelight on the dark waves a kind of photo-negative of the shadows on the wall of Plato\u2019s cave; but there is also a wisdom that is woe, a wisdom of the sort found in Ecclesiastes, which Ishmael calls \u201cthe fine hammered steel of woe.\u201d A \u201cCatskill eagle,\u201d he tells us, can \u201calike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.\u201d So a wise soul must do both: dive down into sorrows and soar out of them. I concluded my toast to Lewis two years ago with my own exhortations. Let us not be woeful tonight, I said. Let us instead be grateful. And we were, all of us who\u2019d assembled that evening to see Lewis Lapham off\u2014grateful for the magazine he\u2019d created, for the educations we\u2019d received, for the labors of love the Quarterly had made possible. There\u2019s a passage by the poet Frank Bidart that my mind has returned to often these past two years. I quoted it in the first contribution I ever made to Lapham\u2019s Quarterly , an essay that ran in the Spring 2011 issue, Lines of Work . \u201cThere is something missing in our definition, vision, of a human being: the need to make,\u201d Bidart observes in a sequence of poems devoted to the topic of making. \u201cThe culture in which we live honors specific kinds of making (shaping or misshaping a business, a family) but does not understand how central making itself is as manifestation and mirror of the self, fundamental as eating or sleeping.\u201d Such making externalizes our inner lives, inspirits the material with the immaterial. Such making is utterly distinct from producing. We would never call sexual intercourse \u201clove-producing\u201d or someone who ended a war a \u201cpeace-producer.\u201d The word poetry derives from the Greek to make, suggesting the kind of soulful making Bidart means. Economists can measure the Gross Domestic Product, but there is no measure for Gross Domestic Poeisis. Those of us who have contributed to the Quarterly \u2014by writing for it or editing for it but also perhaps by donating or subscribing to it\u2014have done so in part because the Quarterly always honored the kinds of making that Bidart has in mind, the kinds of making that answer a fundamental human need.  Every issue was made in the way that Lewis taught the editors on his staff to make a magazine: artfully, purposefully, skillfully, lovingly, with care. When news of Lewis Lapham\u2019s death arrived on July 24, 2024, it was easy to imagine that the Quarterly was \u201cnot so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern.\u201d But in 2025, for Lapham\u2019s Quarterly at least, the sources of joy and occasions for gratitude have outnumbered the sorrows. We are grateful, this November, to the leadership of Bard College and the Hannah Arendt Center, the Quarterly \u2019s future home. We are grateful to all of our donors, without whose donations, large and small, the revival of the Quarterly would not be possible. We are grateful to Francine Prose, the Quarterly \u2019s new editor-at-large, a joyful collaborator whose devotion to the Quarterly and belief in this effort to revive it have been like wind in the sails. Because we were obliged to make this effort without an editorial budget, we knew that success would depend greatly upon the generosity of authors and publishers. Not only have authors and publishers accepted our invitations; they have often done so enthusiastically, while cheering us on. \u201cSuch a bright spot of good news in the lit mag world,\u201d one editor wrote to us last summer. In conversations these past several months, I\u2019ve sometimes likened the Quarterly to a pedal-powered flying machine, but the analogy only works if the flying machine has room in the editorial cockpit for several pilots, all pedaling to keep the machine aloft. I would like to name and thank them here: Jaime Fuller selects the weekly reading from our archives that appears in  Back Matter, our weekly email newsletter, which she edits while also looking after the website. (You can sign up for the Back Matter newsletter here. ) Jason David Brown, an LQ veteran since its founding, has continued to look after design and production. Apoorva Tadepalli compiles and arranges our Rest Is History column, a curated list of historical readings. Leopold Froelich has been serving as our de-facto copy chief, making the final pass on every sentence we publish. Anna Logan, when not assisting executive director and publisher Paul Morris, has assisted with editorial, preparing galleys. This fall, editorial intern James Showers has been in charge of drafting the bibliographic show notes for The World in Time . Christo Hays has been the collage-artist behind Extracts, our biweekly Substack column. Peter Augerot edits readings and show notes while engineering the audio for the podcast. And we at Lapham\u2019s Quarterly are perhaps most grateful of all to those loyal readers whose desire that the Quarterly endure inspired the ongoing effort to revive it. How glad and how grateful the relief from our unnatural hallucination of the night. \u2014 D.H.

M. W. Turner, 1796.</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"pullquote\"><p><em>There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. </em></p><p><em>                                                                                    </em>&#8212;Herman Melville</p></div><p>I quoted that sentence in the toast I delivered at the farewell dinner we held for Lewis Lapham on a December evening two years ago. On that December evening, the <em>Quarterly</em>&#8217;s publishing hiatus had just begun. The podcast had fallen silent the previous August. The Energy issue, ready to ship to the printer since the previous June, remained on hold, as did the <em>Quarterly'</em>&#8216;s future. Its editorial staff, furloughed, still harbored some hope that the furlough might soon end; that Lewis Lapham might yet carry on. He intended to. Even then, bound for a retirement community in Florida, he had not given up. The <em>Quarterly</em>&#8217;s staff had learned to edit remotely during the pandemic, after all. It could be done.</p><p>Ishmael makes his distinction between the two kinds of woe&#8212;one wise, the other mad&#8212;in the middle of a dark night. Standing watch at the <em>Pequod</em>&#8217;s helm, hand on the ship&#8217;s &#8220;jawbone tiller,&#8221; he nods off a moment, and when he comes to, he has lost his bearings in the literal sense of the phrase; the ship&#8217;s compass, lit by a binnacle lamp, has vanished. &#8220;Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me.&#8221; </p><p>Gathering his wits and then his whereabouts, he realizes that while dozing off, he&#8217;d turned about so that he was now facing aft, staring out beyond the <em>Pequod&#8217;</em>s stern into the jet gloom of the Pacific. The &#8220;flashes of redness&#8221;? Reflections of the fires of the try-works into which the <em>Pequod</em>&#8217;s crew had fed strips of blubber, rendering them into oil. Just in time to &#8220;prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her,&#8221; Ishmael reorients himself.  &#8220;How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night,&#8221; he says. </p><p>In the manner of Father Mapple finishing a sermon, Ishmael concludes the passage and the chapter with a series of exhortations and linked analogies: &#8220;Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright . . .&#8221; </p><p>He does not end there, on this sunny note, however. He gives his linked analogies a final turn, one that inverts the order of the phrases in my epigraph: There is a woe that is madness, yes, and that mad woe resembles an &#8220;unnatural hallucination of the night&#8221;&#8212;the gleams of firelight on the dark waves a kind of photo-negative of the shadows on the wall of Plato&#8217;s cave; but there is <em>also</em> a wisdom that is woe, a wisdom of the sort found in Ecclesiastes, which Ishmael calls &#8220;the fine hammered steel of woe.&#8221; </p><p>A &#8220;Catskill eagle,&#8221; he tells us, can &#8220;alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.&#8221; So a wise soul must do both: dive down into sorrows and soar out of them.</p><p>I concluded my toast to Lewis two years ago with my own exhortations. Let us not be woeful tonight, I said. Let us instead be grateful. And we were, all of us who&#8217;d assembled that evening to see Lewis Lapham off&#8212;grateful for the magazine he&#8217;d created, for the educations we&#8217;d received, for the labors of love the <em>Quarterly </em>had made possible.  </p><p>There&#8217;s a passage by the poet Frank Bidart that my mind has returned to often these past two years. I quoted it in the first contribution I ever made to <em>Lapham&#8217;s Quarterly</em>, <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/lines-work/lost-tools\">an essay that ran in the Spring 2011 issue, Lines of Work</a>. &#8220;There is something missing in our definition, vision, of a human being: the need to make,&#8221; Bidart observes in a sequence of poems devoted to the topic of making. &#8220;The culture in which we live honors specific kinds of making (shaping or misshaping a business, a family) but does not understand how central making itself is as manifestation and mirror of the self, fundamental as eating or sleeping.&#8221; </p><p>Such making externalizes our inner lives, inspirits the material with the immaterial. Such making is utterly distinct from <em>producing. </em>We would never call sexual intercourse &#8220;love-producing&#8221; or someone who ended a war a &#8220;peace-producer.&#8221; The word <em>poetry</em> derives from the Greek <em>to make, </em>suggesting the kind of soulful making Bidart means. Economists can measure the Gross Domestic Product, but there is no measure for Gross Domestic Poeisis. </p><p>Those of us who have contributed to the <em>Quarterly</em>&#8212;by writing for it or editing for it but also perhaps by donating or subscribing to it&#8212;have done so in part because the <em>Quarterly</em> always honored the kinds of making that Bidart has in mind, the kinds of making that answer a fundamental human need.  Every issue was made in the way that Lewis taught the editors on his staff to make a magazine: artfully, purposefully, skillfully, lovingly, with care.</p><p>When news of Lewis Lapham&#8217;s death arrived on July 24, 2024, it was easy to imagine that the <em>Quarterly </em>was &#8220;not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern.&#8221; But in 2025, for <em>Lapham&#8217;s Quarterly </em>at least, the sources of joy and occasions for gratitude have outnumbered the sorrows. </p><p>We are grateful, this November, to the leadership of Bard College and the Hannah Arendt Center, the <em>Quarterly</em>&#8217;s future home. We are grateful to all of our donors, without whose donations, large and small, the revival of the <em>Quarterly </em>would not be possible. We are grateful to Francine Prose, the <em>Quarterly</em>&#8217;s new editor-at-large, a joyful collaborator whose devotion to the <em>Quarterly</em> and belief in this effort to revive it have been like wind in the sails. Because we were obliged to make this effort without an editorial budget, we knew that success would depend greatly upon the generosity of authors and publishers. Not only have authors and publishers accepted our invitations; they have often done so enthusiastically, while cheering us on. &#8220;Such a bright spot of good news in the lit mag world,&#8221; one editor wrote to us last summer. </p><p>In conversations these past several months, I&#8217;ve sometimes likened the <em>Quarterly</em> to a pedal-powered flying machine, but the analogy only works if the flying machine has room in the editorial cockpit for several pilots, all pedaling to keep the machine aloft. I would like to name and thank them here:</p><ul><li><p>Jaime Fuller selects the weekly reading from our archives that appears in  Back Matter, our weekly email newsletter, which she edits while also looking after the website. (You can sign up for the Back Matter newsletter <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org\">here.</a>)</p></li><li><p>Jason David Brown, an <em>LQ</em> veteran since its founding, has continued to look after design and production.</p></li><li><p>Apoorva Tadepalli compiles and arranges our Rest Is History column, a curated list of historical readings. </p></li><li><p>Leopold Froelich has been serving as our de-facto copy chief, making the final pass on every sentence we publish. </p></li><li><p>Anna Logan, when not assisting executive director and publisher Paul Morris, has assisted with editorial, preparing galleys. </p></li><li><p>This fall, editorial intern James Showers has been in charge of drafting the bibliographic show notes for <em>The World in Time</em>. </p></li><li><p>Christo Hays has been the collage-artist behind Extracts, our biweekly Substack column. </p></li><li><p>Peter Augerot edits readings and show notes while engineering the audio for the podcast. </p></li></ul><p>And we at <em>Lapham&#8217;s Quarterly</em> are perhaps most grateful of all to those loyal readers whose desire that the <em>Quarterly</em> endure inspired the ongoing effort to revive it. How glad and how grateful the relief from our unnatural hallucination of the night. &#8212;<em>D.H.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://laphamsquarterly.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8be778c42e715e178d4dca04e&amp;id=1ac1ac495a&amp;e=e7984a1499\">NEW ON LQ&#8217;S WEBSITE THIS WEEK</a></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4lWp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa44ed3bf-5330-49c8-96d9-2938c8779d57_1090x886.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Illustration: Woodcut from the title page of The Tragicall History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus (1628) by Christopher Marlowe.

        "full_content": "The year 2021 was challenging for the print sector. Lockdowns and restrictions caused a decrease in market demand for traditional print applications. Additionally, wide format, light packaging, and label use expanded. Quickly switching their focus to other markets, businesses experienced rapid development. The industry is showing clear signs of economic revival, which is good news. The year 2023 is predicted to be significantly better. Those who comply will benefit from new trends and play a more significant part in their customers\u2019 success. 1. Digital Print Is Expanding Due To Shifting Supply Networks A clear transition to eCommerce has occurred during the past 12 to 18 months. The expectation among consumers is now for record-breaking delivery timeframes. Due to the increase in local manufacturing and the prolonged overseas shipping times, there is a greater demand for on-demand printing and label manufacturing. Customers are looking for environmentally friendly options. With less trash and pollutants produced, digital printing is an excellent solution to this problem. Additionally, more environmentally friendly materials are used, resulting in lower client costs. What advantages does digital printing have for online shopping? Compared to non-digital technologies, digital print gives significantly more versatility. This means that businesses can develop customized banners, signs, and more printing options using digital designs or innovative packaging with QR codes that can be scanned and shared. Organizations will need to do this to fully capitalize on the advantages of drone-based delivery and real-time package tracking. Additionally, certain digital label presses are now able to create labels that are food-safe. 2. Automation Is Bringing Forth Efficiencies Printers are already saving money and labor by automating print workflows and utilizing inline finishing equipment. Fewer people are needed to manage a job through to completion when operations are automated. As a result, printers can take on more work, provide clients with better results, and spend less money. By automating their workflows, printers can manage orders round-the-clock and maximize the efficiency of their hardware. They can speed up printing and finishing, print on demand, enhance profitability, and provide new services to draw in new clients by streamlining prepress labor. What does the future hold for automation? Automation will continue to spread in 2023 due to its advantages. With the ability to offer more intricate services and outputs thanks to automated workflow adoption, printers may increase consumer demand without raising prices. Margin expansion and the development of the company\u2019s standing as a trustworthy, superior printer are benefits of doing this. Printing companies should focus on automating several critical processes, such as: web to print job submission / prepress color management variable data printing finishing device management 3. Design Solutions A design staff is increasingly crucial for even the smallest printing businesses. Focusing on this business sector can help you stay competitive in the industry, whether you\u2019re a single graphic designer or a large team. In addition, you may now generate income from logo and website design instead of relying simply on print revenue. 4. Digital Marketing One of the most efficient marketing strategies accessible today is digital marketing. One looping piece of social media advertising can reach specific viewers for an unlimited period, making it the ideal example. Social media advertising is just one aspect of digital marketing, though. It also provides extras like podcast production and website hosting. As a result, printing businesses that use these services can significantly increase their revenue in 2023. 5. Increase In Sustainable Printing The rise in sustainable printing services is one trend that is likely to keep expanding over the coming few years. Eco-friendly technology is predicted to become increasingly commonplace in the sector by 2023. These technologies, of course, offer a variety of other advantages in addition to being ecologically beneficial. They can boost your product\u2019s quality while also offering a cost-effective option. 6. The Rise Of Digital Inkjet This rise will be driven mainly by the printing industry, which has a higher demand for lightweight, manageable packaging that is also affordable. To avoid sacrificing quality or speed, selecting an ink that can print on various substrates, including tissue or lightweight packaging, is crucial. You only need a practical inkjet printer that can produce outstanding quality on various surfaces; you don\u2019t want to spend money on pricey coatings or specialized digital stocks. The sharp tool is LED UV inkjet technology. Due to the eCommerce industry\u2019s continuous rapid growth, the need for various packaging choices will remain extremely strong through 2023 and beyond. 7. Direct Mail Marketing Campaigns One of the most basic kinds of advertising is recognized to be direct mail marketing efforts. They are a reliable, efficient technique to bring in new clients while reasonably priced. Direct mail marketing programs allow businesses to maintain brand awareness while influencing current or inactive clients. 8. Sustainability Will Have a Higher Priority Many organizations now focus on minimizing their environmental impact; thus, manufacturers and channel partners must offer more environmentally friendly technological offerings. Improved data analysis and reporting, circular goods and services, carbon data analysis, and process automation can contribute to sustainability. Switching clients from on-premise servers to cloud-based helps lower IT energy usage and associated carbon emissions. Major Shifts in the Digital Printing Industry? Growing technology has always provided more accessible, successful opportunities for companies to diversify their product lines. Profit margins are predicted to rise considerably as digital technology becomes more efficient. Commercial printing companies are also trying to diversify to adjust how businesses manage their print marketing campaigns as they change. As a result of the COVID-19 epidemic, which caused many print suppliers to experience commercial losses, they have begun to diversify their portfolio of goods and services rather than sticking to specific markets. When you successfully meet your customers\u2019 printing needs, they won\u2019t need to look elsewhere for help with their print marketing initiatives. Conclusion Online digital printing\u2019s convenience is a big draw for customers and businesses, and that trend is here to stay. The commercial printing sector has been completely transformed by the availability of internet uploads of photos and designs for picture albums, greeting cards, brochures, signage, and more.",

Automation Is Bringing Forth Efficiencies</h2>\n<p>Printers are already saving money and labor by automating print workflows and utilizing inline finishing equipment. Fewer people are needed to manage a job through to completion when operations are automated. As a result, printers can take on more work, provide clients with better results, and spend less money.</p>\n<p>By automating their workflows, printers can manage orders round-the-clock and maximize the efficiency of their hardware. They can speed up printing and finishing, print on demand, enhance profitability, and provide new services to draw in new clients by streamlining prepress labor.</p>\n<p>What does the future hold for automation? Automation will continue to spread in 2023 due to its advantages.</p>\n<p>With the ability to offer more intricate services and outputs thanks to automated workflow adoption, printers may increase consumer demand without raising prices. </p>\n<p>Margin expansion and the development of the company&#8217;s standing as a trustworthy, superior printer are benefits of doing this. Printing companies should focus on automating several critical processes, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>web to print</li>\n<li>job submission / prepress</li>\n<li>color management</li>\n<li>variable data printing</li>\n<li>finishing</li>\n<li>device management</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Design Solutions</h2>\n<p>A design staff is increasingly crucial for even the smallest printing businesses. Focusing on this business sector can help you stay competitive in the industry, whether you&#8217;re a single <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/starting-a-business/how-to-be-a-freelance-graphic-designer/344489\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">graphic designer</a> or a large team. In addition, you may now generate income from logo and website design instead of relying simply on print revenue.</p>\n<h2>4. Digital Marketing</h2>\n<p>One of the most efficient <a href=\"https://technicallyeasy.net/7-unnoticed-and-cheap-social-media-marketing-strategies/\">marketing strategies</a> accessible today is digital marketing. One looping piece of social media advertising can reach specific viewers for an unlimited period, making it the ideal example.</p>\n<p>Social media advertising is just one aspect of digital marketing, though. It also provides extras like podcast production and website hosting. As a result, printing businesses that use these services can significantly increase their revenue in 2023.</p>\n<h2>5. Increase In Sustainable Printing</h2>\n<p>The rise in sustainable <a href=\"https://technicallyeasy.net/high-quality-printing-services-you-can-now-turn-your-dream-into-reality/\">printing services</a> is one trend that is likely to keep expanding over the coming few years. Eco-friendly technology is predicted to become increasingly commonplace in the sector by 2023.</p>\n<p>These technologies, of course, offer a variety of other advantages in addition to being ecologically beneficial. They can boost your product&#8217;s quality while also offering a cost-effective option.</p>\n<h2>6. The Rise Of Digital Inkjet</h2>\n<p>This rise will be driven mainly by the printing industry, which has a higher demand for lightweight, manageable packaging that is also affordable.</p>\n<p>To avoid sacrificing quality or speed, selecting an ink that can print on various substrates, including tissue or lightweight packaging, is crucial.</p>\n<p>You only need a practical inkjet printer that can produce outstanding quality on various surfaces; you don&#8217;t want to spend money on pricey coatings or specialized digital stocks.</p>\n<p>The sharp tool is LED UV inkjet technology. Due to the eCommerce industry&#8217;s continuous rapid growth, the need for various packaging choices will remain extremely strong through 2023 and beyond. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Direct Mail Marketing Campaign\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-15853\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://technicallyeasy.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/print-620x372.jpg\" width=\"620\" /></p>\n<h2>7. Direct Mail Marketing Campaigns</h2>\n<p>One of the most basic kinds of advertising is recognized to be <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/direct-mail\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">direct mail marketing</a> efforts. They are a reliable, efficient technique to bring in new clients while reasonably priced.</p>\n<p>Direct mail marketing programs allow businesses to maintain brand awareness while influencing current or inactive clients.</p>\n<h2>8. Sustainability Will Have a Higher Priority</h2>\n<p>Many organizations now focus on minimizing their environmental impact; thus, manufacturers and channel partners must offer more environmentally friendly technological offerings.</p>\n<p>Improved data analysis and reporting, circular goods and services, carbon data analysis, and process automation can contribute to sustainability. Switching clients from on-premise servers to cloud-based helps lower IT energy usage and associated carbon emissions.</p>\n<h2>Major Shifts in the Digital Printing Industry?</h2>\n<p>Growing technology has always provided more accessible, successful opportunities for companies to diversify their product lines.</p>\n<p>Profit margins are predicted to rise considerably as <a href=\"https://technicallyeasy.net/why-digital-technology-is-so-vital-for-business-marketing/\">digital technology</a> becomes more efficient. Commercial printing companies are also trying to diversify to adjust how businesses manage their print marketing campaigns as they change.</p>\n<p>As a result of the COVID-19 epidemic, which caused many print suppliers to experience commercial losses, they have begun to diversify their portfolio of goods and services rather than sticking to specific markets.</p>\n<p>When you successfully meet your customers&#8217; printing needs, they won&#8217;t need to look elsewhere for help with their print marketing initiatives.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Online digital printing&#8217;s convenience is a big draw for customers and businesses, and that trend is here to stay. The commercial printing sector has been completely transformed by the availability of internet uploads of photos and designs for picture albums, greeting cards, brochures, signage, and more.</p>"

So: new 2 u. The following 2022 story was for Departures (RIP). I just sent it to a friend who asked for Edinburgh recommendations. This was a dream of a travel story because it was an easy jaunt, a quick turnaround with no fixed schedule, and I didn\u2019t have to speak to anyone. The flip side of such luck is one must create a thesis instead of being handed one. Originally, I\u2019d sent the editor all of these elaborate, heady pitches about different locales, plus a lightning round at the end that included this line: \u201cP.S. I studied away in Edinburgh in 1999 and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s changed.\u201d The \u201cya think?\u201d was silent. But it worked. Thesis accepted. I would love to say this was pitching magic on my part, but apparently the magazine already had some kinda hotel deal in Edinburgh. So off I went. In a stroke of international tax acumen, I had a couple of cheap flammable dresses sent straight to my hotel from the UK chain, Oasis (not that one, this one , where we used to shop for going-out clothes as undergrads\u2026sadly, the new owners have driven it into the ground and now everything is somehow less revealing and more shoddily made). The other thing I remember about this particular piece is getting on the horn with the English photographer who would trail me after I left town. I was already in Edinburgh by then, pacing up and down Victoria Street, when we realized he\u2019d also gone to school there. He was a bit older, but we knew some of the same people because we\u2019d both been very drunk at the same clubs, on the same nights, 20+ years prior. I\u2019m sad you can\u2019t see his photos because the magazine is no more. But they were moody and unique for a travel magazine affiliated with a credit card. I\u2019d scan the pictures from the hardcopy, which is lurking around my apartment somewhere, but I don\u2019t want to do that. What a world, what a town, what a hangover\u2026 On Edinburgh for Departures : Edinburgh is a city of firsts for me. I spent the majority of my junior year as a student there, studying away. And now, a small toll for writing this piece, I must date myself \u2014 this was in 1999. Three years after the release of Trainspotting . Trainspotting was the biggest cultural remapping of the Scottish capital in a century, a title it held for only a heartbeat before being usurped by that bespectacled kid with a wand. Edinburgh was my first time out of the country. My first legal drink. My introduction to the plays of J.M. Barrie. It was the first European city I ever saw, a fact that ruined me for life. Not every old city features a castle jutting up through the streets as if the building itself had been born underground and decided, on a whim, to get some air. It is impossible to convey how deeply and instantly I adored Edinburgh, this half ballerina, half rugby player of a town that flashed its priorities (the Sir Walter Scott monument is the largest of its kind dedicated to a writer) and its private parts (there\u2019s no such thing as modesty \u2014or cold\u2014 for a University student) with equal aplomb. When it came time to go, Edinburgh became home to yet another first: my first missed flight. I stayed up all night with a boy from Aberdeen, drinking under a sky that refused to darken, and slept through my alarm. My last memory is of sprinting across George IV Bridge, cutting through the streets in my pajamas, flinging myself onto the next Heathrow-bound train. What a terrible sensation it is to rush at breakneck speed, away from a place you don\u2019t want to leave. As a graduation gift, my parents gave me The Best American Short Stories of The Century with a note: \u201cWelcome back to America. We\u2019re not so bad.\u201d It\u2019s the best present they\u2019ve ever given me \u2014 not so much the book, but the lie. Scotland is not a difficult place to get to as a grown person. I could have gone back. But I\u2019d pressed it so firmly in the past, I worried I\u2019d obliterate my memories by returning. When I land in Edinburgh in mid-May of 2022, everything is eerily familiar. The weather still ping-pongs and the wind brings the occasional whiff of malt from the distilleries. In the car to my hotel, Forth 1 radio is having a throwback weekend to, yes, 1999. As I listen to Britney Spears\u2019s Baby One More Time (tell me about it, Brit), the volcanic peak of Arthur\u2019s Seat comes into view, exploding with yellow flowers. Pigeons, possibly the same pigeons or at least their descendants, perch on the heads of every monument. Even my hotel, The Balmoral, is no mere hotel, but an indelible part of the skyline and surely one of the most arresting-looking hotels on the planet. I have witnessed tourists ask the kilted doorman if they\u2019ve reached Balmoral Castle , the summer home of the royal family. If I could tell my Tesco-sandwich-eating, H&M-wearing, cartilage-piercing twenty-year-old self that I\u2019d be staying in a meticulously remodeled suite at The Balmoral with castle views and seagulls soaring past my field of vision, she\u2019d choke on her chips. But there is something in the air besides malt. Something new. The Scottish have long fancied themselves a liberal country and, especially post-Brexit, talks of independence are once again circulating. This ideological marriage between independence and the Scottish is a well-known one. May I direct your attention to a little film called Braveheart ? Still, there\u2019s a palpable shift since last I checked. The spirit of independence, of individuality, can be found in every corner of daily life, from fashionable restaurants to National Museum exhibits focusing on Scottish designers (Alexander McQueen, obviously, Holly Fulton, less obviously) to local retail chains like Biscuit that sell upstart brands. None of this existed at the turn of the century. Most of it didn\u2019t exist a decade ago. What may seem like inevitable gentrification and global trend, well, probably is. But the pulse of such things is profound here. For example, Trainspotting made Leith famous for being a dodgy neighborhood with a major heroin problem. As a foreign student, I didn\u2019t venture too far into Leith (let us consider the early films of Danny Boyle my college orientation videos). But in recent years, the shoreline has transformed. Now the area is home to coffee shops like Twelve Triangles (try the apricot coconut twist), the Edinburgh Honey Co., and upscale restaurants like Martin Wishart and Kitchin, the aptly named Tom Kitchin\u2019s Michelin-star tribute to Scottish cuisine, featuring mussels flown in from the Shetland Islands, langoustines from the Isle of Mull and wild mushrooms from the Ochil Hills. Kitchin tells me that people often congratulate him for having the foresight to open a restaurant in Leith when he did, in 2006. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t know,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cwe only knew we could afford it.\u201d I realize I am in danger of getting not one but two cities wrong, Past Edinburgh and Present Edinburgh. It\u2019s the interloper\u2019s curse. Yes, housing was always cheaper for students in Leith. And yes, Edinburgh is small enough, one can\u2019t just avoid whole swaths of it. But imagine, if you will, the contrast between Williamsburg, Brooklyn between 1999 and now. Now multiply that contrast by a factor of five. Even in Old Town, which plays host to such legendary destinations as The Last Drop (hangings used to take place outside the pub), unexpected aspects of the city have changed. My student housing, located off the pub-strewn Cowgate Street (a stretch of road I\u2019m happy to report still resembles a kind of causeway in Hades) now features a courtyard with bamboo plants and an elevated deck, built directly over the site of many a student meal, exiting out the wrong way. It\u2019s a stone\u2019s throw away from Mary\u2019s Milkbar, an au courant retro gelato shop. Upscale tweed stores like Walker Slater on Victoria Street have added modern touches to bespoke tailoring. In New Town, Rose Street is home to an off-kilter cocktail speakeasy called Never Really Here. If you can find it. Independent record stores like Thorne Records in Bruntsfield and bookstores like The Golden Hare in Stockbridge and Topping & Co. in New Town (which opened just before the pandemic) have exploded. Topping & Co., in particular, is symbolic of a kind of regional arts takeover. The building used to house bankers\u2019 offices. As lovely as upscale Edinburgh is to behold, I do wonder if student life has undergone a similarly dramatic transformation. Auditing classes would both be impossible (I\u2019m only here for a week) and futile (not reflective of my experience). But the day before I leave, I do my best: I walk through the meadows, a stretch of freshly cut grass fields that you can smell on approach to the campus as clearly as you can smell the sea in Leith. I buy a bottle of Irn-Bru, a Scottish orange soda that tastes like a Tic Tac and a pen cap had a baby. For some mysterious reason, it is only drinkable when massively hungover. I climb Calton Hill with its Parthenon-inspired columns, going up and down the steep pathway of Jacob\u2019s Ladder which, 20 years later, is a trial for the lungs on the way up and a trial for the knees on the way down. I eat lunch near campus, going to Union of Genius for soup, where signs of modernity emerge \u2014 every last person who walks in orders the vegan chili. That night, I gear myself up, both mentally and sartorially, to do what Edinburgh students do best: go out . My friends and I used to get pitchers of flavored vodka at Bar Kohl and dance at Honeycomb and Pure. Those places have all gone the way of the dodo and if there are private clubs, I know not of them. But Why Not?, in the center of town, pre-dates me. Opened in 1995, Why Not? features elements that are massively unappealing to a woman in her early 40s (an LED room, for starters). But at least the line moves quickly and, before I know it, I\u2019ve got a stamp on my wrist that reads \u201cFilthy Fridays\u201d and am surrounded by clusters of early 20-somethings. One of them offers to buy me a drink, which makes the entire trip worth it. He confesses that he\u2019s embarrassed because he graduated in 2016 and \u201cprobably shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d If that isn\u2019t my cue to leave, I don\u2019t know what is, but just then a group of girls totters past me, wearing dresses made of less material than their earrings. \u201cI\u2019m having a malfunction!\u201d one of them cries. \u201cMy shoes are broke!\u201d but her cohort is out of earshot. I offer her my shoulder while she fiddles with her strap. Then a song that\u2019s 90% bass comes on and she grabs my hand to come dance, which I do until the respectable hour of 1AM. Something that hasn\u2019t changed? Nightlife in Edinburgh has always been more about joy than exclusivity. Walking back through the lobby of the Balmoral feels like walking back into adulthood. As I pass the front desk, the fireplace crackling, I try to look as put together as the sculptural flower arrangements. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s working. But the next morning, when my alarm goes off, I wake up very much in 2022. I go for a swim in the hotel pool and sit in the sauna, sweating out the alcohol. Coffee in hand, I stroll over George IV Bridge at a normal pace but feeling the same pang of anticipatory homesickness I felt in 1999. So much has changed, so much time has passed, but on this score, this city and I picked up right where we left off. Subscribe now",

Kitchin tells me that people often congratulate him for having the foresight to open a restaurant in Leith when he did, in 2006.</p><p>&#8220;But we didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; he says, smiling, &#8220;we only knew we could afford it.&#8221;</p><p>I realize I am in danger of getting not one but <em>two</em> cities wrong, Past Edinburgh and Present Edinburgh. It&#8217;s the interloper&#8217;s curse. Yes, housing was always cheaper for students in Leith. And yes, Edinburgh is small enough, one can&#8217;t just avoid whole swaths of it. But imagine, if you will, the contrast between Williamsburg, Brooklyn between 1999 and now. Now multiply that contrast by a factor of five.</p><p>Even in Old Town, which plays host to such legendary destinations as The Last Drop (hangings used to take place outside the pub), unexpected aspects of the city have changed. My student housing, located off the pub-strewn Cowgate Street (a stretch of road I&#8217;m happy to report still resembles a kind of causeway in Hades) now features a courtyard with bamboo plants and an elevated deck, built directly over the site of many a student meal, exiting out the wrong way. It&#8217;s a stone&#8217;s throw away from Mary&#8217;s Milkbar, an <em>au courant</em> retro gelato shop. Upscale tweed stores like Walker Slater on Victoria Street have added modern touches to bespoke tailoring. In New Town, Rose Street is home to an off-kilter cocktail speakeasy called Never Really Here. If you can find it. Independent record stores like Thorne Records in Bruntsfield and bookstores like The Golden Hare in Stockbridge and Topping &amp; Co. in New Town (which opened just before the pandemic) have exploded. Topping &amp; Co., in particular, is symbolic of a kind of regional arts takeover. The building used to house bankers&#8217; offices.</p><p>As lovely as upscale Edinburgh is to behold, I do wonder if student life has undergone a similarly dramatic transformation. Auditing classes would both be impossible (I&#8217;m only here for a week) and futile (not reflective of my experience). But the day before I leave, I do my best: I walk through the meadows, a stretch of freshly cut grass fields that you can smell on approach to the campus as clearly as you can smell the sea in Leith. I buy a bottle of Irn-Bru, a Scottish orange soda that tastes like a Tic Tac and a pen cap had a baby. For some mysterious reason, it is only drinkable when massively hungover. I climb Calton Hill with its Parthenon-inspired columns, going up and down the steep pathway of Jacob&#8217;s Ladder which, 20 years later, is a trial for the lungs on the way up and a trial for the knees on the way down. I eat lunch near campus, going to Union of Genius for soup, where signs of modernity emerge &#8212; every last person who walks in orders the vegan chili.</p><p>That night, I gear myself up, both mentally and sartorially, to do what Edinburgh students do best: go <em>out</em>. My friends and I used to get pitchers of flavored vodka at Bar Kohl and dance at Honeycomb and Pure. Those places have all gone the way of the dodo and if there are private clubs, I know not of them. But Why Not?, in the center of town, pre-dates me. Opened in 1995, Why Not? features elements that are massively unappealing to a woman in her early 40s (an LED room, for starters). But at least the line moves quickly and, before I know it, I&#8217;ve got a stamp on my wrist that reads &#8220;Filthy Fridays&#8221; and am surrounded by clusters of early 20-somethings.</p><p>One of them offers to buy me a drink, which makes the entire trip worth it. He confesses that he&#8217;s embarrassed because he graduated in 2016 and &#8220;probably shouldn&#8217;t be here.&#8221; If that isn&#8217;t my cue to leave, I don&#8217;t know what is, but just then a group of girls totters past me, wearing dresses made of less material than their earrings. &#8220;I&#8217;m having a malfunction!&#8221; one of them cries. &#8220;My shoes are broke!&#8221; but her cohort is out of earshot. I offer her my shoulder while she fiddles with her strap. Then a song that&#8217;s 90% bass comes on and she grabs my hand to come dance, which I do until the respectable hour of 1AM. Something that hasn&#8217;t changed? Nightlife in Edinburgh has always been more about joy than exclusivity.</p><p>Walking back through the lobby of the Balmoral feels like walking back into adulthood. As I pass the front desk, the fireplace crackling, I try to look as put together as the sculptural flower arrangements. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s working. But the next morning, when my alarm goes off, I wake up very much in 2022. I go for a swim in the hotel pool and sit in the sauna, sweating out the alcohol. Coffee in hand, I stroll over George IV Bridge at a normal pace but feeling the same pang of anticipatory homesickness I felt in 1999. So much has changed, so much time has passed, but on this score, this city and I picked up right where we left off.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://sloanecrosley.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5PyZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0209a198-7c20-4b5d-bfbe-f3cfb28b4bbb_250x312.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"312\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5PyZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0209a198-7c20-4b5d-bfbe-f3cfb28b4bbb_250x312.jpeg\" width=\"250\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p>"

        "full_content": "What happens when the nation\u2019s top health agency loses its experts, sidelines its scientific advisors, and rewrites longstanding rules for vaccines, research, and federal grants\u2014all in a matter of months? On a recent episode of Stanford Legal , host Professor Pam Karlan interviewed Stanford health law Professor Michelle Mello about her take on the recent upheaval inside the Department of Health and Human Services. Their conversation traces the consequences: a rapid hollowing out of career staff, vaccine recommendations thrown into flux, states stepping in to fill gaps left by federal retreat, and researchers abruptly cut off from funding they had already secured. Professor of Law and Health Policy Michelle Mello Mello (BA \u201993) is a leading empirical health law scholar whose research is focused on understanding the effects of law and regulation on health care delivery and population health outcomes. She holds a joint appointment at the Stanford University School of Medicine in the Department of Health Policy. The following is a shortened and edited version of the full podcast transcript, which can be found here . Pam Karlan: We have had a lot of Secretaries of Health and Human Services over the course of that department since it split from the old Health, Education, and Welfare Department, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had one quite like our current secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of just how seismic the changes have been here? Michelle Mello: It is early days, so it\u2019s hard to say where we\u2019re going to land, but the amount of chaos that has been introduced into the federal health policy landscape by the secretary in the first several months is unprecedented both in the types of things, substantively, that have been done, and in the way they have been done. Pam Karlan: Sometimes it is said that \u201cpersonnel is policy,\u201d and here we\u2019ve seen some really huge changes in personnel, not just political appointees like the secretary or the deputy secretary, or the various people who are presidential appointees, but also changes in personnel in at the career level as well. Can you give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing there? Michelle Mello: Yes, this is one of the things that really makes me the saddest, when I think about what has changed in health policy over the last nine or ten months. The enormous well of expertise that has led the federal health response for decades in the civil service has been hollowed out. These are career scientists, from the hard sciences as well as the social sciences. Folks who have deep subject matter expertise in really technical health policy issues like reimbursement for the Medicare program, or the way in which people layer on different kinds of subsidies to buy their health insurance, or the ways in which vaccines are procured and supplied to states\u2014gone. The remaining personnel are deeply demoralized. And when you think about the amount of expertise that is required to run these health programs efficiently and without waste, it makes me fairly despondent. Pam Karlan: We\u2019re seeing this across the government. I see it obviously from the Department of Justice angle. There were people who were experts on all sorts of statutes you\u2019ve never heard of, but they understood how the Federal Tort Claims Act worked or how the Vacancies Act worked or the like. Some of these people are being fired and others are resigning or taking these fork-in-the-road early retirements or the like. Do you have a sense of how much of the issue is the result of people leaving because they can\u2019t do the work anymore that they came to do? Listen to the Full Podcast Michelle Mello: I think it is primarily people being laid off or fired, or told that their services are no longer required. And that goes for external experts like the professors and others who serve on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, for example, as well as civil servants. Pam Karlan: Can you explain why it matters what the vaccine committee says about which vaccines certain people can get, and the relationship to people\u2019s insurance? Michelle Mello: This is an independent advisory committee. It is advisory to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, and it is composed of volunteers who historically have been deeply respected scientific experts, primarily from academia. They give very generously of their time to evaluate issues about which vaccines and vaccinations should be recommended for children and adults in the United States. That\u2019s always been somewhat controversial work because there has always been a segment of the U.S. population, albeit a small one, that has resisted having vaccines required. But of course, during COVID, their work became very much more in the public eye and the subject of much resistance because they made decisions about who would have access to the COVID vaccine. They don\u2019t make decisions about vaccination mandates, but many states use their recommendations as the basis for the mandate decisions that they make. What\u2019s really important from an access perspective is that vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices must, as a condition of the Affordable Care Act, be covered by insurers without a copayment. So, at the point of care, the patient is not billed for the vaccine. During COVID, that was not such a big deal because COVID vaccines were subsidized by a separate line of funding. But for childhood vaccines, which can get very expensive, it is really critical that insurance coverage be maintained. The concern was that once ACIP changed its recommendations, insurance companies would start changing their coverage. Thankfully, if there is a silver lining to the fact that the new members of ACIP are widely considered to be not particularly well qualified, it is that the insurers have rejected the opportunity to stop covering vaccines based on that group\u2019s new set of recommendations. Pam Karlan: You\u2019ve written recently that with all this chaos in Washington, and the falloff of professional expertise at HHS, state public health departments are going to have to step up if we\u2019re going to continue to protect Americans\u2019 health. Michelle Mello: Yes, and vaccines are just one example of that. The way that it\u2019s playing out now for vaccines is that we have this new ACIP whose findings, I think is fair to say, are not respected or regarded as evidence-based by people who know\u2014by experts. And one thing that has been called into question is whether the CDC itself will continue to base its recommendations on the advice of this committee as it historically, nearly always has. That question was what led to the firing of Dr. Susan Monarez. In a little over a month on the job, she managed to go from being eminently well qualified, in the view of the secretary, to untrustworthy. One issue is whether the CDC will do what ACIP says, but then a separate issue is: will others follow the advice of the CDC? Both during the Biden administration and during the first Trump administration, there were many in the United States who felt that they could no longer trust the advice of the CDC because it didn\u2019t align with their own perceptions of what the right thing to do was, and they felt that the agency, under whatever leadership it was under, was untrustworthy. So there had already been a destabilization of public trust in CDC. We have survey data that bear that out. What does this all mean for states? It means that there is a wellspring of a demand for guidance from outside of Washington and Atlanta. And states, to some extent, are starting to fill that gap. Many of the western states have come together in an alliance to make their own recommendations about vaccinations, as essentially a shadow CDC. They\u2019re going to do what the CDC no longer seems to be able to do, which is to follow the evidence and make recommendations. Then, on the other hand, we have certain states going very much in the other direction and just saying: \u201cVaccines, no thank you.\u201d Pam Karlan: There are reports that some states are going to get rid of vaccine mandates for kids in schools. And I would assume that will be followed relatively quickly with an outbreak of measles or chicken pox or whatever the kids aren\u2019t being vaccinated against. Michelle Mello: Yes, we will see. What has happened is that the Florida Surgeon General has said that Florida will be ditching requirements for school entry vaccines.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t have the authority to do that. It\u2019s done through a process. But assuming that that process follows, then vaccines effectively become optional. It\u2019s important to remember that, even in Florida, most parents understand that getting your kids vaccinated is a good idea. Even those who object to being required to do so may well come forward and do so. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see plummeting rates of school entry vaccination. But the difficulty is with regard to some of these very highly infectious diseases. Vaccination rates don\u2019t need to plummet; they just need to dip a little bit before we lose herd immunity. There has to be a certain percentage of the population that has immunity, either through having been infected with the disease or through vaccination. And for measles, because it is so infectious, that number is very high, around 95%. Pam Karlan: Across huge parts of society that used to have a great deal of respect for scientific and medical expertise, are seeing a drop off. What accounts for that? Michelle Mello: We\u2019re still trying to understand that fully, but the narrative that makes sense to me when I look at the polling data has to do with a misapprehension of the way scientific knowledge evolves and changes over time, coupled some degree of hubris on the part of Biden-era health officials about their own confidence in their pronouncements. The way science works, of course, is through learning\u2014the accretion of evidence, the study of evidence\u2014which often leads us to change our conclusions about things like: How does a pathogen spread in the population? How dangerous is it? That is science working well, but particularly during an emergency like a pandemic, that is not really what people want to hear. They want to hear that somebody is taking care of things, knows what to do, and is doing it. Perhaps that is why pandemic-era health officials were very confident in their pronouncements about things like the efficacy of the COVID vaccine in preventing infection, or whether we did or did not need to mask. That made it difficult for them to later amend their recommendations when we learned more about the efficacy of the vaccines, what vaccines were really good for, and what they were less good at, and how we should think about risk/benefit overall. As well as things about transmissibility, which changed recommendations around masking, around social distancing and lots of other things. But again, when you have come out hot, with a lot of confidence in your pronouncements in response to the public\u2019s demand that it looks like somebody\u2019s taking care of things, it\u2019s hard to backtrack. I think this anger and fear around recommendations changing, permeates out into science generally, into a feeling that it can\u2019t be trusted. It all serves to undercut the whole basis through which evidence-based policy is made, which is that you\u2019re supposed to have this openness to learning that you were wrong. Pam Karlan: I think people\u2019s scientific literacy has not been a focus of K-12 education in the last 20 years. The \u201cteaching to the tests\u201d of reading and just basic math has perhaps led people not to understand scientific methods? Michelle Mello: That\u2019s an interesting hypothesis. I think even if you did get that kind of messaging when you were 16, it may be hard to remember that. Particularly when you\u2019re being bombarded with very different messaging from certain mainstream media outlets or from social media, which is very condemnatory of moves to change one\u2019s mind about scientific matters. Pam Karlan: Do you think this is a moment of any kind of opportunity, or is this just a moment of threat? Michelle Mello: It\u2019s hard to work in this field and see it as much more than a moment of threat for so many reasons, including reasons we haven\u2019t talked about around, funding of science, but I think with this shift in leadership in public health, from the federal to state level, does come certain interesting opportunities around learning. This famous judicial quote about the states as \u201claboratories\u201d really comes to mind when we see, for example, now states moving in very different directions with vaccination policy or other things. From a public health perspective that is bad, as we think we know a few things about what is good for public health, and states are going in very different directions with respect to these things. From a research perspective, it\u2019s great because what you want is a lot of variation in policy. That gives you things that you can statistically exploit for learning. So, when we see things trending in Florida in a very different way than in California, we will have a good hypothesis that it has something to do with vaccination policy. We\u2019ll have much better data with which to study it. Pam Karlan: There also have been a series of funding cutoffs to various universities, either targeting particular universities, or targeting particular kinds of science, particularly science that seems from the Trump administration\u2019s perspective, to be too much about diversity, equity, and inclusion. How much of a long-term effect will we likely see from what the administration\u2019s doing now? Michelle Mello: I think it\u2019s going to have a very long-term effect in particular areas. So, areas where research has essentially been shut down, like mRNA vaccine research, or any research that has to do with differences in health outcomes among people of different races and ethnicities. I think it takes a long time to rebuild that. In talking about how he would like to have \u201cpause\u201d for eight years from certain lines of scientific research, the secretary seems to envision that you can just walk out of a science lab, turn the lights out, and come back eight years later, dust the machines off and boot everything back up. But of course, science doesn\u2019t work that way. We will lose the talent, both our young trainees who would otherwise be coming to train here, in part because they could no longer get visas, even if they did have the funding. And we will lose faculty talent as well. For people who were in those lines of business, they will have to be in other lines of business, and they will continue to stay in those lines of business, or they may leave the country altogether. In other areas I think it\u2019s more of a temporary dent. The research community is resilient. We are used to peaks and troughs in the availability of funding in different areas, and fortunately, there are other alternative funders that have stepped forward in certain areas to fill gaps. There is also the possibility of reconceiving or reframing research in ways that match the administration\u2019s current priorities. But overall, it is a very bleak landscape. Pam Karlan: I feel for the people who are trying to figure out how to challenge cutoffs of funds that were already given to researchers. That is, we\u2019re not even talking about next year\u2019s grants yet. We\u2019re still talking about the grants that were already made and where people had every reason to expect that the money they\u2019d been awarded was going to flow to them. Michelle Mello: Yes, it does feel a little bit like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall. And that is honestly what it has felt like to come to work in a medical school for the last nine months. That is, every day seems to be some new twist on the previous day\u2019s disappointment or horror. I will say, though, I do have optimism about the courts here. I don\u2019t share the cynicism of some that judges can\u2019t see the difference between legal and illegal conduct if they have a certain political valence. And I actually think that many of the signs from the lower courts are very encouraging and even reassuring as to how these battles will end up in the long run. The trouble is that universities are hemorrhaging money every day right now, and so waiting for that day to come is very painful. Pam Karlan: As we start thinking about the next round of grants and how they\u2019ll be awarded, what should we make of these proposed university \u201ccompacts,\u201d which presumably give preference to schools agreeing to a set of pretty political commitments? That\u2019s not something we\u2019ve seen in federal grant-making before. Michelle Mello: It\u2019s hard to think of an analog. The government has long had quite a bit of latitude to award grants as it sees fit, subject to certain statutory criteria. What has protected\u00a0 the scientific community is that NIH and other agencies have long relied heavily on the judgments of what we call \u201cstudy sections,\u201d groups of volunteer scientists who are asked to read proposals and prioritize them for funding. The agencies and institutes don\u2019t have to follow these recommendations, but they typically have. One of the important changes that we\u2019ve seen in the last few months, quite independent of the compact, is the announcement that the heads of these institutes that are responsible for reviewing these recommendations will be replaced by political appointees who will be presumably using criteria other than scientific merit to make award decisions. And that upends a lot of settled understandings about the relationship between the merit of a proposal and the likelihood of funding. Michelle Mello (BA \u201993) holds a joint appointment at the Stanford University School of Medicine in the Department of Health Policy. She is the author of more than 270 articles on medical liability, public health law, the public health response to COVID-19, pharmaceuticals and vaccines, artificial intelligence, data ethics and privacy, biomedical research ethics and governance, and other topics.

Their conversation traces the consequences: a rapid hollowing out of career staff, vaccine recommendations thrown into flux, states stepping in to fill gaps left by federal retreat, and researchers abruptly cut off from funding they had already secured.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_49346\" style=\"width: 1024px;\"><img alt=\"Michelle M.

Kennedy Jr. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of just how seismic the changes have been here?</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It is early days, so it&#8217;s hard to say where we&#8217;re going to land, but the amount of chaos that has been introduced into the federal health policy landscape by the secretary in the first several months is unprecedented both in the types of things, substantively, that have been done, and in the way they have been done.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sometimes it is said that \u201cpersonnel is policy,\u201d and here we&#8217;ve seen some really huge changes in personnel, not just political appointees like the secretary or the deputy secretary, or the various people who are presidential appointees, but also changes in personnel in at the career level as well. Can you give us a sense of what you&#8217;re seeing there?</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yes, this is one of the things that really makes me the saddest, when I think about what has changed in health policy over the last nine or ten months. The enormous well of expertise that has led the federal health response for decades in the civil service has been hollowed out. These are career scientists, from the hard sciences as well as the social sciences. Folks who have deep subject matter expertise in really technical health policy issues like reimbursement for the Medicare program, or the way in which people layer on different kinds of subsidies to buy their health insurance, or the ways in which vaccines are procured and supplied to states\u2014gone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The remaining personnel are deeply demoralized. And when you think about the amount of expertise that is required to run these health programs efficiently and without waste, it makes me fairly despondent.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We&#8217;re seeing this across the government. I see it obviously from the Department of Justice angle. There were people who were experts on all sorts of statutes you&#8217;ve never heard of, but they understood how the Federal Tort Claims Act worked or how the Vacancies Act worked or the like. Some of these people are being fired and others are resigning or taking these fork-in-the-road early retirements or the like. Do you have a sense of how much of the issue is the result of people leaving because they can&#8217;t do the work anymore that they came to do?</span></p>\n<p><a class=\"btn-filled btn-m\" href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/stanford-legal/navigating-uncertainty-and-unprecedented-shifts-in-federal-health-policy/\">Listen to the Full Podcast</a></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think it is primarily people being laid off or fired, or told that their services are no longer required. And that goes for external experts like the professors and others who serve on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, for example, as well as civil servants.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 Can you explain why it matters what the vaccine committee says about which vaccines certain people can get, and the relationship to people&#8217;s insurance?</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is an independent advisory committee. It is advisory to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, and it is composed of volunteers who historically have been deeply respected scientific experts, primarily from academia. They give very generously of their time to evaluate issues about which vaccines and vaccinations should be recommended for children and adults in the United States. That&#8217;s always been somewhat controversial work because there has always been a segment of the U.S. population, albeit a small one, that has resisted having vaccines required. But of course, during COVID, their work became very much more in the public eye and the subject of much resistance because they made decisions about who would have access to the COVID vaccine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They don&#8217;t make decisions about vaccination mandates, but many states use their recommendations as the basis for the mandate decisions that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> make. What&#8217;s really important from an access perspective is that vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices must, as a condition of the Affordable Care Act, be covered by insurers without a copayment. So, at the point of care, the patient is not billed for the vaccine. During COVID, that was not such a big deal because COVID vaccines were subsidized by a separate line of funding. But for childhood vaccines, which can get very expensive, it is really critical that insurance coverage be maintained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concern was that once ACIP changed its recommendations, insurance companies would start changing their coverage. Thankfully, if there is a silver lining to the fact that the new members of ACIP are widely considered to be not particularly well qualified, it is that the insurers have rejected the opportunity to stop covering vaccines based on that group&#8217;s new set of recommendations.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You&#8217;ve written recently that with all this chaos in Washington, and the falloff of professional expertise at HHS, state public health departments are going to have to step up if we&#8217;re going to continue to protect Americans\u2019 health.</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yes, and vaccines are just one example of that. The way that it&#8217;s playing out now for vaccines is that we have this new ACIP whose findings, I think is fair to say, are not respected or regarded as evidence-based by people who know\u2014by experts. And one thing that has been called into question is whether the CDC itself will continue to base its recommendations on the advice of this committee as it historically, nearly always has.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That question was what led to the firing of Dr. Susan Monarez. In a little over a month on the job, she managed to go from being eminently well qualified, in the view of the secretary, to untrustworthy. One issue is whether the CDC will do what ACIP says, but then a separate issue is: will others follow the advice of the CDC?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both during the Biden administration and during the first Trump administration, there were many in the United States who felt that they could no longer trust the advice of the CDC because it didn&#8217;t align with their own perceptions of what the right thing to do was, and they felt that the agency, under whatever leadership it was under, was untrustworthy. So there had already been a destabilization of public trust in CDC. We have survey data that bear that out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does this all mean for states? It means that there is a wellspring of a demand for guidance from outside of Washington and Atlanta. And states, to some extent, are starting to fill that gap. Many of the western states have come together in an alliance to make their own recommendations about vaccinations, as essentially a shadow CDC. They&#8217;re going to do what the CDC no longer seems to be able to do, which is to follow the evidence and make recommendations. Then, on the other hand, we have certain states going very much in the other direction and just saying: \u201cVaccines, no thank you.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Stanford Health Law Expert Michelle Mello on Biden's New Vaccine Mandates\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-379373 size-large\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/iStock-1230251561-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are reports that some states are going to get rid of vaccine mandates for kids in schools. And I would assume that will be followed relatively quickly with an outbreak of measles or chicken pox or whatever the kids aren&#8217;t being vaccinated against.</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yes, we will see. What has happened is that the Florida Surgeon General has said that Florida will be ditching requirements for school entry vaccines.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t have the authority to do that. It&#8217;s done through a process. But assuming that that process follows, then vaccines effectively become optional. It&#8217;s important to remember that, even in Florida, most parents understand that getting your kids vaccinated is a good idea. Even those who object to being </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">required</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to do so may well come forward and do so. So I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to see plummeting rates of school entry vaccination. But the difficulty is with regard to some of these very highly infectious diseases. Vaccination rates don\u2019t need to plummet; they just need to dip a little bit before we lose herd immunity. There has to be a certain percentage of the population that has immunity, either through having been infected with the disease or through vaccination. And for measles, because it is so infectious, that number is very high, around 95%.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Across huge parts of society that used to have a great deal of respect for scientific and medical expertise, are seeing a drop off. What accounts for that?</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We&#8217;re still trying to understand that fully, but the narrative that makes sense to me when I look at the polling data has to do with a misapprehension of the way scientific knowledge evolves and changes over time, coupled some degree of hubris on the part of Biden-era health officials about their own confidence in their pronouncements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way science works, of course, is through learning\u2014the accretion of evidence, the study of evidence\u2014which often leads us to change our conclusions about things like: How does a pathogen spread in the population? How dangerous is it? That is science working well, but particularly during an emergency like a pandemic, that is not really what people want to hear. They want to hear that somebody is taking care of things, knows what to do, and is doing it. Perhaps that is why pandemic-era health officials were very confident in their pronouncements about things like the efficacy of the COVID vaccine in preventing infection, or whether we did or did not need to mask. That made it difficult for them to later amend their recommendations when we learned more about the efficacy of the vaccines, what vaccines were really good for, and what they were less good at, and how we should think about risk/benefit overall. As well as things about transmissibility, which changed recommendations around masking, around social distancing and lots of other things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But again, when you have come out hot, with a lot of confidence in your pronouncements in response to the public&#8217;s demand that it looks like somebody&#8217;s taking care of things, it&#8217;s hard to backtrack. I think this anger and fear around recommendations changing, permeates out into science generally, into a feeling that it can&#8217;t be trusted. It all serves to undercut the whole basis through which evidence-based policy is made, which is that you&#8217;re supposed to have this openness to learning that you were wrong.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think people&#8217;s scientific literacy has not been a focus of K-12 education in the last 20 years. The \u201cteaching to the tests\u201d of reading and just basic math has perhaps led people not to understand scientific methods?</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That&#8217;s an interesting hypothesis. I think even if you did get that kind of messaging when you were 16, it may be hard to remember that. Particularly when you&#8217;re being bombarded with very different messaging from certain mainstream media outlets or from social media, which is very condemnatory of moves to change one&#8217;s mind about scientific matters.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Do you think this is a moment of any kind of opportunity, or is this just a moment of threat?</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It&#8217;s hard to work in this field and see it as much more than a moment of threat for so many reasons, including reasons we haven&#8217;t talked about around, funding of science, but I think with this shift in leadership in public health, from the federal to state level, does come certain interesting opportunities around learning. This famous judicial quote about the states as \u201claboratories\u201d really comes to mind when we see, for example, now states moving in very different directions with vaccination policy or other things. From a public health perspective that is bad, as we think we know a few things about what is good for public health, and states are going in very different directions with respect to these things. From a research perspective, it&#8217;s great because what you want is a lot of variation in policy. That gives you things that you can statistically exploit for learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, when we see things trending in Florida in a very different way than in California, we will have a good hypothesis that it has something to do with vaccination policy. We&#8217;ll have much better data with which to study it.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There also have been a series of funding cutoffs to various universities, either targeting particular universities, or targeting particular kinds of science, particularly science that seems from the Trump administration&#8217;s perspective, to be too much about diversity, equity, and inclusion. How much of a long-term effect will we likely see from what the administration&#8217;s doing now?</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think it&#8217;s going to have a very long-term effect in particular areas. So, areas where research has essentially been shut down, like mRNA vaccine research, or any research that has to do with differences in health outcomes among people of different races and ethnicities. I think it takes a long time to rebuild that. In talking about how he would like to have \u201cpause\u201d for eight years from certain lines of scientific research, the secretary seems to envision that you can just walk out of a science lab, turn the lights out, and come back eight years later, dust the machines off and boot everything back up. But of course, science doesn&#8217;t work that way. We will lose the talent, both our young trainees who would otherwise be coming to train here, in part because they could no longer get visas, even if they did have the funding. And we will lose faculty talent as well. For people who were in those lines of business, they will have to be in other lines of business, and they will continue to stay in those lines of business, or they may leave the country altogether.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other areas I think it&#8217;s more of a temporary dent. The research community is resilient. We are used to peaks and troughs in the availability of funding in different areas, and fortunately, there are other alternative funders that have stepped forward in certain areas to fill gaps. There is also the possibility of reconceiving or reframing research in ways that match the administration&#8217;s current priorities. But overall, it is a very bleak landscape.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Working with Images 1\" class=\"alignright wp-image-143943 size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/iStock_000008915647_Large-e1464990969739-681x1024.jpg\" width=\"681\" /></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I feel for the people who are trying to figure out how to challenge cutoffs of funds that were already given to researchers. That is, we&#8217;re not even talking about next year&#8217;s grants yet. We&#8217;re still talking about the grants that were already made and where people had every reason to expect that the money they&#8217;d been awarded was going to flow to them.</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yes, it does feel a little bit like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall. And that is honestly what it has felt like to come to work in a medical school for the last nine months. That is, every day seems to be some new twist on the previous day\u2019s disappointment or horror.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will say, though, I do have optimism about the courts here. I don&#8217;t share the cynicism of some that judges can&#8217;t see the difference between legal and illegal conduct if they have a certain political valence. And I actually think that many of the signs from the lower courts are very encouraging and even reassuring as to how these battles will end up in the long run. The trouble is that universities are hemorrhaging money every day right now, and so waiting for that day to come is very painful.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pam Karlan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As we start thinking about the next round of grants and how they\u2019ll be awarded, what should we make of these proposed university \u201ccompacts,\u201d which presumably give preference to schools agreeing to a set of pretty political commitments? That\u2019s not something we\u2019ve seen in federal grant-making before.</span></p>\n<p><b>Michelle Mello:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It&#8217;s hard to think of an analog. The government has long had quite a bit of latitude to award grants as it sees fit, subject to certain statutory criteria. What has protected\u00a0 the scientific community is that NIH and other agencies have long relied heavily on the judgments of what we call \u201cstudy sections,\u201d groups of volunteer scientists who are asked to read proposals and prioritize them for funding. The agencies and institutes don&#8217;t have to follow these recommendations, but they typically have. One of the important changes that we&#8217;ve seen in the last few months, quite independent of the compact, is the announcement that the heads of these institutes that are responsible for reviewing these recommendations will be replaced by political appointees who will be presumably using criteria other than scientific merit to make award decisions. And that upends a lot of settled understandings about the relationship between the merit of a proposal and the likelihood of funding.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michelle Mello (BA \u201993) holds a joint appointment at the Stanford University School of Medicine in the Department of Health Policy.

        "full_content": "I started losing weight in the fall of 2023. I was severely depressed. I had been the subject of a vicious scandal, and it felt like the whole world turned its back on me. I became deeply suicidal. I cut off all my loved ones. I couldn\u2019t trust anyone because during the scandal, former close colleagues and friends (who I\u2019d been on pleasant or neutral terms), started to come out and make things up about me. God knows why. I supposed to kick me while I\u2019m down? Fifteen minutes of fame? I guess I\u2019ll never know. That resulted in my extreme isolation. I was angry every single day. Mostly because I couldn\u2019t go out and defend myself. I couldn\u2019t tell the world the truth because no one would believe me. I understood my position of power, and I sat in it. The old me would tend to binge when sad and depressed. I would order hundreds of dollars of food delivery and eat everything until my stomach felt like it would explode. But this time I just didn\u2019t feel like doing that. Not because I thought it would result in my weight loss, but honestly, I didn\u2019t care about my body. I didn\u2019t want to feel safe. A huge part of me blamed myself for what had happened to me. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so nice Melissa\u201d, I thought to myself. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t try to help everyone all the time\u201d. \u201cThis is what you get when you let the wrong people in\u201d. So, in my self-loathing and self-neglect I began to rot. As someone who has talked and sang about self-love their entire career, it was hard to watch that happen to myself. And so I decided to turn my extreme inaction to action. I needed a way to process my pain through my body, so I started with Pilates. I only worked with black women instructors and learned that Pilates was actually cofounded by a black woman. I used it as physical therapy. Sometimes I cried after sessions. I found that I had lost some weight in that process, but it wasn\u2019t as significant as it is now. Because it wasn\u2019t intentional. I\u2019d decided that winter to sit and record a video saying I wanted to intentionally lose weight. Why? I guess I felt like I had lost everything, and I wanted to change. After talking to a few therapists I discovered that my weight had been a protective shield, a joyful comfort zone, and even sometimes a super hero suit to protect me through life. My weight, like my hair, represented time. It stored energy. And I wanted to release myself from it. So from that moment on any weight on my physical body that was subtracted was not a pound \u2018lost\u2019 but a pound \u2018released\u2019. It was energetic for me, not vain. And yes, I\u2019ve had my back issues that I\u2019ve talked about explicitly. It most certainly helped in that area as well. But I\u2019m not gonna sit up as one of these \u201cbig girl celebrities\u201d that have had dramatic changes to their body and give you that \u201cI did it for medical reasons\u201d story. Because we all know yes, that exists\u2014Yes, there\u2019s less pressure on my joints the less that I weigh. Yes there\u2019s less risk of certain health issues the less I weigh. But let\u2019s be real. I wanted to change how I felt in my body. I had been holding onto so much since my father passed away in 2009. I had been holding onto relationships that were deeply abusive and toxic since 2011. I had been carrying the weight of supporting my family since 2016. I wanted to let-it-the-fuck go. It was never about being \u2018thin\u2019 for me. I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s possible for me to be considered actually \u2018thin\u2019. I will always have the stretch, and the skin of a woman who carries great weight. And I\u2019m proud of that. Even when the world doesn\u2019t want me to be. The way I\u2019ve been treated as a public figure since I was introduced to the world as a confident, body positive figure has been borderline emotional abuse. And it\u2019s simply because of my weight. Nevertheless, I made it work for me. I trolled the hell out of those obnoxious memes. I was self-aware that I was the butt of every fat joke on the Internet. And yet I continued to be who I am, because it\u2019s the only thing I know how to be. And even in being myself, no one really believed it. I discovered that people thought that I was being \u201cperformative\u201d. Performing being body positive when I was the first body positive musician to become mainstream doesn\u2019t even make sense. Performative only works if you know it\u2019s gonna work for you. I had no clue because there was no one before me to show me the way. I discovered that people thought that I actually was fatphobic and had internalized fatphobia. That everything I was doing in my activism, which included hiring black women who have larger bodies, creating literal industries for plus size dancers and models and actresses was because I \u2018secretly hate fat people\u2019. (You think I\u2019m making this up but if I had a dollar for every time an agent had \u201clooking for a Lizzo type\u201d on a casting I have a lot of dollars). I was sick and tired of my identity being overshadowed by my fatness. People could not see my talent as a musician because they were too busy accusing me of making \u201cbeing fat\u201d my whole personality. I know that my story isn\u2019t unique. I know that women in bigger bodies, especially black women in bigger bodies, have had this working against them since forever. I had to actively work against \u2018mammy\u2019 tropes by being hypersexual and vulgar because being a mammy by definition is being desexualized. It still didn\u2019t work, they saw my body and they judged me for it. And that\u2019s the reality that nobody wants to talk about. We\u2019re in an era where the bigger girls are getting smaller because they\u2019re tired of being judged. And now those bigger girls are being judged for getting smaller by the very community they used to empower. There\u2019s nothing wrong with living in a bigger body. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being fat. But if a woman wants to change, she should be allowed to change. I got a lot of backlash back in 2018 because my song was in a Weight Watchers commercial. Oprah asked 2018 me and back then I was like \u201chell yeah! it\u2019s Oprah\u201d. I had no idea the implications. And I learned very quickly how using my music in a weight watchers commercial can be harmful. It was my first big lesson in public accountability. Admittedly, I\u2019ve made some questionable posts since then (namely, my smoothie detox). But along the way I have been very conscious of how I present my \u2018weight release\u2019 to the world. I documented it. I made sure not to say how much weight I actually released because I didn\u2019t want anyone holding themselves to a certain standard. I am fully aware my actions as a public figure can have real and possibly harmful effects on other people. But one day I decided to show my results from getting consistent lymphatic draining massages for over two years. I\u2019d been taking photos in the mirror of the spa bathroom and I was proud of my results. I posted the side-by-side photos and I framed it as \u201cthis is my results from getting lymphatic massage\u201d. Shortly after that, I saw a video from Jameela Jamil saying something like \u201cyikes people are now posting before and after photos\u201d and went on to say she\u2019s censoring people because they are \u201ctriggering\u201d. (I want to say that me and Jameela have had a good relationship and I like her and I appreciate what she does for the body positive community. She does real work and she actually holds people accountable) but I took it personally. Because I was guilty, I had posted a before and after photo. I didn\u2019t see how it was possibly triggering. Maybe I need to unlearn why before and after photos make me feel good about myself? But it felt unfair, I had seen photos of Jameela when she was overweight. She posts that photo to remind us of her experience and it validates her as a body activist. But now I see her as an objectively \u201cthin\u201d and beautiful woman. And I thought \u2018why is it OK that she gets to post old photos of her body but no one else\u2019s body is allowed to change\u2019? It reminded me of the box that the commercialization of body positivity had put me in. When it was our little movement back in 2013, it was freedom. The body positive movement gave me wings and I could sore to unimaginable heights. But then it started to generate big business. And just like that it became branded for everyone. Unfortunately, once something becomes for everyone, the people that it was originally created for are edged out. It\u2019s no longer for us anymore. It\u2019s no longer for the size 16 and up community. It\u2019s no longer for the disabled plus-sized community. It\u2019s no longer for the queer, indigenous, plus-sized community. I would look up the has body positivity hashtag and I would see size 8, straight, white women dominating the category. So here we are halfway through the decade, where extended sizes are being magically erased from websites. Plus sized models are no longer getting booked for modeling gigs. And all of our big girls are not-so big anymore. I am still a proud big girl. Objectively Big. Over 200 pounds. And I love myself as much as I\u2019ve loved myself no matter what the scale says. There may be some bad actors amongst us. Some people may have used the movement for financial gain or fame, and once it no longer served them they abandoned it. That\u2019s ok, it was never about them anyway. We have a lot of work to do, to undo the effects of the ozempic boom. I have a lot of work to do to regain the trust of the movement that gave me wings. It is work I am willing and ready to do. What do we do? We continue to have conversations. We continue to hold each other accountable. We release ourselves from the illusion that there is only good and bad. We re-introduce nuance into our discussions. I want us to allow the body positive movement to expand and grow far away from the commercial slop its become. Because movements move ..",

I was severely depressed. I had been the subject of a vicious scandal, and it felt like the whole world turned its back on me. I became deeply suicidal. I cut off all my loved ones. I couldn&#8217;t trust anyone because during the scandal, former close colleagues and friends (who I&#8217;d been on pleasant or neutral terms), started to come out and make things up about me. God knows why. I supposed to kick me while I&#8217;m down? Fifteen minutes of fame? I guess I&#8217;ll never know. That resulted in my extreme isolation. I was angry every single day. Mostly because I couldn&#8217;t go out and defend myself. I couldn&#8217;t tell the world the truth because no one would believe me. I understood my position of power, and I sat in it. The old me would tend to binge when sad and depressed. I would order hundreds of dollars of food delivery and eat everything until my stomach felt like it would explode. But this time I just didn&#8217;t feel like doing that. Not because I thought it would result in my weight loss, but honestly, I didn&#8217;t care about my body. I didn&#8217;t want to feel safe. A huge part of me blamed myself for what had happened to me. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be so nice Melissa&#8221;, I thought to myself. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t try to help everyone all the time&#8221;. &#8220;This is what you get when you let the wrong people in&#8221;. So, in my self-loathing and self-neglect I began to rot. As someone who has talked and sang about self-love their entire career, it was hard to watch that happen to myself. And so I decided to turn my extreme inaction to action.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I needed a way to process my pain through my body, so I started with Pilates. I only worked with black women instructors and learned that Pilates was actually cofounded by a black woman. I used it as physical therapy. Sometimes I cried after sessions. I found that I had lost some weight in that process, but it wasn&#8217;t as significant as it is now. Because it wasn&#8217;t intentional. I&#8217;d decided that winter to sit and record a video saying I wanted to intentionally lose weight. Why? I guess I felt like I had lost everything, and I wanted to change. After talking to a few therapists I discovered that my weight had been a protective shield, a joyful comfort zone, and even sometimes a super hero suit to protect me through life. My weight, like my hair, represented time. It stored energy. And I wanted to release myself from it. So from that moment on any weight on my physical body that was subtracted was not a pound &#8216;lost&#8217; but a pound &#8216;released&#8217;. It was energetic for me, not vain. And yes, I&#8217;ve had my back issues that I&#8217;ve talked about explicitly. It most certainly helped in that area as well. But I&#8217;m not gonna sit up as one of these &#8220;big girl celebrities&#8221; that have had dramatic changes to their body and give you that &#8220;I did it for medical reasons&#8221; story. Because we all know yes, that exists&#8212;Yes, there&#8217;s less pressure on my joints the less that I weigh. Yes there&#8217;s less risk of certain health issues the less I weigh. But let&#8217;s be real. I wanted to change how I felt in my body. I had been holding onto so much since my father passed away in 2009. I had been holding onto relationships that were deeply abusive and toxic since 2011. I had been carrying the weight of supporting my family since 2016. I wanted to let-it-the-fuck go.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It was never about being &#8216;thin&#8217; for me. I don&#8217;t even think it&#8217;s possible for me to be considered actually &#8216;thin&#8217;. I will always have the stretch, and the skin of a woman who carries great weight. And I&#8217;m proud of that. Even when the world doesn&#8217;t want me to be. The way I&#8217;ve been treated as a public figure since I was introduced to the world as a confident, body positive figure has been borderline emotional abuse. And it&#8217;s simply because of my weight. Nevertheless, I made it work for me. I trolled the hell out of those obnoxious memes. I was self-aware that I was the butt of every fat joke on the Internet. And yet I continued to be who I am, because it&#8217;s the only thing I know how to be. And even in being myself, no one really believed it. I discovered that people thought that I was being &#8220;performative&#8221;. Performing being body positive when I was the first body positive musician to become mainstream doesn&#8217;t even make sense. Performative only works if you know it&#8217;s gonna work for you. I had no clue because there was no one before me to show me the way. I discovered that people thought that I actually was fatphobic and had internalized fatphobia. That everything I was doing in my activism, which included hiring black women who have larger bodies, creating literal industries for plus size dancers and models and actresses was because I &#8216;secretly hate fat people&#8217;. (You think I&#8217;m making this up but if I had a dollar for every time an agent had &#8220;looking for a Lizzo type&#8221; on a casting I have a lot of dollars).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I was sick and tired of my identity being overshadowed by my fatness. People could not see my talent as a musician because they were too busy accusing me of making &#8220;being fat&#8221; my whole personality. I know that my story isn&#8217;t unique. I know that women in bigger bodies, especially black women in bigger bodies, have had this working against them since forever. I had to actively work against &#8216;mammy&#8217; tropes by being hypersexual and vulgar because being a mammy by definition is being desexualized. It still didn&#8217;t work, they saw my body and they judged me for it. And that&#8217;s the reality that nobody wants to talk about. We&#8217;re in an era where the bigger girls are getting smaller because they&#8217;re tired of being judged. And now those bigger girls are being judged for getting smaller by the very community they used to empower. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with living in a bigger body.

Right: Tania Nemer, then of the Summit County Prosecutor's Office in Ohio, speaks in 2021 about why she became a prosecutor (YouTube/Summit County Prosecutor's Office). An \"abruptly\" fired immigration judge based in Cleveland, Ohio , filed a lawsuit on Monday against U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and the DOJ, alleging that President Donald Trump's claimed \"constitutional right to discriminate against federal workers\" derailed her career and threatens to do the same to millions of others moving forward. Tania Nemer, formerly a prosecutor in the Summit County Prosecutor's Office and a magistrate in the Akron Municipal Court, alleged that she was fired 15 days after Trump's inauguration as the 47th president, within her two-year probationary trial period as an immigration judge in the DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). Nemer's trial period began in 2023. Immigration judges, unlike federal U.S. district judges, circuit judges, and Supreme Court justices, do not have lifetime jobs and are not part of the judicial branch. Rather, they serve in the executive branch and are appointed by the U.S. attorney general after a \"full background investigation.\" During the two-year trial period, as a former EOIR director explained in 2008 congressional testimony, immigration judges \"can be terminated if they fail to consistently demonstrate the necessary abilities, professionalism, and temperament on the bench,\" factors that DOJ higher-ups weigh based on the assessments of \"court staff, peers, and interested parties, and, five months before the end of the Immigration Judge's probationary period [\u2026] a report with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General.\" According to Nemer's lawsuit, she was \"abruptly fired\" roughly two weeks after Trump's return to the Oval Office, hardly a \"careful evaluation of [her] qualifications or fitness for office\u2014but instead as part of a rushed attempt by the new Administration to target disfavored civil servants.\" Worse yet, Nemer claimed, the firing can only be explained as the consequence of open discrimination. Love true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox \"Indeed, in a formal administrative decision issued in this case, the government has concluded that Title VII's prohibition of discrimination in the federal workforce conflicts with the President's inherent Article II authority to oversee the executive branch. This argument boils down to the remarkable legal theory that the President has a constitutional right to discriminate against federal workers , in violation of the law. That is wrong. Full stop,\" said the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \"It bears emphasis: The government's legal theory reflects an unprecedented assault by the current Administration against the civil service laws that protect millions of federal employees. If the government prevails in transforming the law, it will eviscerate the professional, non-partisan civil service as we know it.\" Nemer further alleged that \"unlawful discrimination\" punished her for being a woman, a \"dual citizen of Lebanon, having been born to immigrant parents who moved to this country to pursue the American dream,\" and for having run for \"judicial office in Ohio as a Democrat.\" According to the plaintiff, not only did her supervisor have glowing things to say about her job performance upon her ouster, the DOJ has said little other than she was removed from her role. \"Far from explaining why she had been fired, Ms. Nemer's supervisor told her that she was one of his best employees. Prior to being escorted out of the building, both Ms. Nemer's supervisor and the Acting Chief Immigration Judge of the United States claimed that they both did not know why she was being fired,\" the lawsuit continued. \"And to this day, the government has failed to offer any coherent and legitimate nondiscriminatory rationale for her termination, in writing or otherwise.\" \"Instead, the government has simply said that 'Ms. Nemer was removed from her position by the Acting Attorney General under the authority of Article II of the United States Constitution,'\" the plaintiff continued. Two months after her firing, Nemer said, she filed a formal discrimination complaint at the \"appropriate federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) office,\" but rather than \"fully\" investigating her complaint, the complaint was tossed due to Trump's Article II powers. The civil complaint said that if this the law then no federal worker is safe \u2014 meaning that \"the stakes are extraordinary.\" \"This is not hypothetical,\" the lawsuit added. \"It is what happened in this case . Ms. Nemer was discriminated against because of her sex and national origin, in violation of Title VII, and she was discriminated against because she previously ran for office and prominently associated with a political party, in violation of the First Amendment.\" \"That unjust proposition is as wrong as it sounds,\" the lawsuit concluded, claiming that Nemer is entitled to compensatory damages and reinstatement because her career has been damaged to the point of derailment.

Nemer's trial period began in 2023.</p>\n<p>Immigration judges, unlike federal U.S. district judges, circuit judges, and Supreme Court justices, do not have lifetime jobs and are not part of the judicial branch. Rather, they serve in the executive branch and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/1003.10\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">are appointed by</a> the U.S. attorney general <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/eoir/JudgeHiringPolicy1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">after a</a> \"full background investigation.\"</p>\n<p>During the two-year trial period, as a former EOIR <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2008/09/23/OhlsontestimonyEOIROversight09232008.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">director explained</a> in 2008 congressional testimony, immigration judges \"can be terminated if they fail to consistently demonstrate the necessary abilities, professionalism, and temperament on the bench,\" factors that DOJ higher-ups weigh based on the assessments of \"court staff, peers, and interested parties, and, five months before the end of the Immigration Judge's probationary period [\u2026] a report with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General.\"</p>\n<p>According to Nemer's lawsuit, she was \"abruptly fired\" roughly two weeks after Trump's return to the Oval Office, hardly a \"careful evaluation of [her] qualifications or fitness for office\u2014but instead as part of a rushed attempt by the new Administration to target disfavored civil servants.\"</p>\n<p>Worse yet, Nemer claimed, the firing can only be explained as the consequence of open discrimination.</p>\n<p><strong>Love true crime?\u00a0<a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com/email-newsletter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up</a> for our newsletter, The Law&amp;Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox</strong></p>\n<p>\"Indeed, in a formal administrative decision issued in this case, the government has concluded that Title VII's prohibition of discrimination in the federal workforce conflicts with the President's inherent Article II authority to oversee the executive branch. This argument boils down to the remarkable legal theory that the President has a <em>constitutional right to discriminate against federal workers</em>, in violation of the law. That is wrong. Full stop,\" said the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \"It bears emphasis: The government's legal theory reflects an unprecedented assault by the current Administration against the civil service laws that protect millions of federal employees. If the government prevails in transforming the law, it will eviscerate the professional, non-partisan civil service as we know it.\"</p>\n<p>Nemer further alleged that \"unlawful discrimination\" punished her for being a woman, a \"dual citizen of Lebanon, having been born to immigrant parents who moved to this country to pursue the American dream,\" and for having run for \"judicial office in Ohio as a Democrat.\"</p>\n<p>According to the plaintiff, not only did her supervisor have glowing things to say about her job performance upon her ouster, the DOJ has said little other than she was removed from her role.</p>\n<p>\"Far from explaining why she had been fired, Ms. Nemer's supervisor told her that she was one of his best employees. Prior to being escorted out of the building, both Ms. Nemer's supervisor and the Acting Chief Immigration Judge of the United States claimed that they both did not know why she was being fired,\" the lawsuit continued. \"And to this day, the government has failed to offer any coherent and legitimate nondiscriminatory rationale for her termination, in writing or otherwise.\"</p>\n<p>\"Instead, the government has simply said that 'Ms. Nemer was removed from her position by the Acting Attorney General under the authority of Article II of the United States Constitution,'\" the plaintiff continued.</p>\n<p>Two months after her firing, Nemer said, she filed a formal discrimination complaint at the \"appropriate federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) office,\" but rather than \"fully\" investigating her complaint, the complaint was tossed due to Trump's Article II powers.</p>\n<p>The civil complaint said that if this the law then no federal worker is safe \u2014 meaning that \"the stakes are extraordinary.\"</p>\n<p>\"This is not hypothetical,\" the lawsuit added. \"It is what happened <em>in this case</em>. Ms. Nemer was discriminated against because of her sex and national origin, in violation of Title VII, and she was discriminated against because she previously ran for office and prominently associated with a political party, in violation of the First Amendment.\"</p>\n<p>\"That unjust proposition is as wrong as it sounds,\" the lawsuit concluded, claiming that Nemer is entitled to compensatory damages and reinstatement because her career has been damaged to the point of derailment.</p>\n<p>Read the lawsuit <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.287227/gov.uscourts.dcd.287227.1.0.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/abruptly-fired-immigration-judge-sues-over-trump-claimed-constitutional-right-to-discriminate/\">'This is not hypothetical': Canned immigration judge sues over Trump's claimed 'constitutional right to discriminate,' says he derailed her career</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com\">Law & Crime</a>.</p>"

It is a diagnosis that parallels almost exactly what abundance-oriented thinkers like my Niskanen Center colleague Jen Pahlka offer today. Just as Pahlka does, the authors of Reinventing Government noted the specter of auditors ready to snap at any violation of procedure.

She warns that neither the Trump administration nor the abundance movement have adequately grappled with some enduring questions . argues that Reinventing Government went wrong by turning headcount reductions into a goal rather than one measure of progress \u2014 and that the Trump administration has made the same mistake. offers a more balanced view of Reinventing Government, noting that some of its enduring changes were for the good \u2014 but that its efforts to transform bureaucratic culture did not last. says Reinventing Government went wrong because it turned work that at the state level had been focused on policy outcomes into a federal project framed mostly in political terms . And to conclude, Menchaca argues that Democrats\u2019 great error in the Obama and Biden administrations was to fool themselves into thinking they could manage around government dysfunction rather than work with Congress to tackle it head-on \u2014 a mistake they cannot afford to repeat. One answer to why Reinventing Government failed is that its authors misunderstood the problem, or preferred not to understand it. In this view, the problem is not that good civil servants are trapped in bad systems. It is that civil servants constitute a \u201cdeep state\u201d that undermines elected officials and does the bidding of an unaccountable elite. Whatever the merits of this position, the second Trump administration has advanced a breathtakingly extreme version of it. In the words of Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, the administration\u2019s mission is to rescue us from a \u201c postconstitutional \u201d order and from \u201cthe late stages of a complete Marxist takeover of the country, in which our adversaries already hold the weapons of the government apparatus, and they have aimed it at us.\u201d If that is the world we live in, then the best we can do is slash government to the bare minimum and bludgeon civil servants into obeying the commands of their political superiors, making expertise conditioned on loyalty. That counsel of despair won\u2019t get us a high-performing government, but it will restore electoral accountability, save us a few bucks in taxes, and allow the economy to rip \u2014 at least until investors realize they no longer have the statistics, macroeconomic stability, emergency services, disease surveillance, and other public goods that make business tick. Another answer to the question of why Reinventing Government fell short is that the problem of bureaucratic reform is hard. That means it requires not only brilliance at building organizations but also sustained political commitment. Such a political commitment must grow out of a vision of how bureaucracy can enable democracy and be anchored by substantive policy goals. Believers in that vision must then be relentless and willing to absorb costs in order to advance it over the long term. How long? We could date the Progressive Era from the 1880s through the 1920s \u2013 a 40-year stretch that was followed by even more sweeping changes with the New Deal. Reinventing Government may have been the start of something, not the end. As early as 1994, its authors appreciated the size of the challenge we face today: \u201cAs the Industrial Era has given way to the Information Age, institutions \u2014 both public and private \u2014 have come face to face with obsolescence.\u201d It\u2019s time to stare back, study the lessons of history, and start again.

Everything Bundle Last chance to get the four-book bundle of my ebooks This includes I am Uncluttered (Yellow) , The Intelligence Illusion , Out of the Software Crisis , and Bad Writing , in PDF and EPUB Get The Ebook for \u20ac49 EUR (price includes VAT, where applicable) The web is filled with slop # \u201cAI\u201d-generated advice about how we can use this or that \u201cAI\u201d slop tool to get rich or influence people. Most analysis is little more than a surface-level reactionary take on whatever nonsense is coming out of the tech industry. Much of it is just \u201ctrue believers\u201d commenting on how this or that \u201cagentic\u201d system is not the future. Half the newsletters are angry that LLMs are built on stolen work. Half are written and edited with LLMs. Those two groups aren\u2019t exclusive. It\u2019s easy to get lost \u2013 pulled into anger and frustration on the one hand, or into irrational exuberance on the other \u2013 but if you\u2019re one of the few whose job is relatively safe, you still need to try and sort the useful from the useless. But that\u2019s hard because the online information ecosystem is collapsing. Roll back the clock, please and thank you # It would be great if we could just get back to the imperfect web we had. Much of it was nonsense, sure, but once you got past the grifters and the obvious nonsense, quite a few people \u2013 especially in tech \u2013 were writing, talking, and making videos on subjects that mattered to them, personally, that they could speak to with some authority or experience. If you wanted to figure out how to set up a Caddy web server on your chosen host with the configuration you needed, odds were a quick search would lead you to a blog post where somebody had done just that and been nice enough to document how they did it. Today, the same search is likely to lead you to a multitude of texts that look like blog posts of that exact genre, written by humans, except they\u2019re filled with fabrications and nonsense, attributing features to the software it does not have, using configuration parameters that don\u2019t work, and citing versions that don\u2019t exist. The old web information ecosystem is gone. It\u2019s not coming back. The web is people # A complex system that\u2019s no longer getting the energy, work, and input needed to counteract the forces pulling it apart will collapse. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that it\u2019s physics, but it\u2019s the nearest sociocultural equivalent to a certainty. But collapse doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the communities or people disappear. Collapse means fragmentation. We don\u2019t know exactly how it\u2019ll fragment \u2013 how the pieces will shape up or how they will work \u2013 but one thing we do know: The web we read will be made up of people we trust. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the only way we know how to counter the flood of chatbots, grifters, con artists, and fabrications. We pick the people we trust to write on a topic or problem and, in exchange, we support their work in some way. Paid newsletters are definitely a part of that. As are forms of patronage and sponsorship. But there\u2019s a limit to how many subscriptions any of us can commit to. Subscriptions are a commitment and the times are precarious. We also don\u2019t get much for that commitment, as readers. Emails, even paid, get shuffled off into archives, never to be revisited, and an email app isn\u2019t the greatest reading environment to begin with. Platforms act like attention roach motels, undermining our efforts at structuring and directing our attention. Even online courses tie you to platforms and connections that may or may not be reliable in the long run. Ebooks aren\u2019t a bad deal in comparison. They are self-contained. The formats are standardised. You pay once and you get files you can keep. Compared to the $60-120 USD per year you often pay for a professional or field-specific newsletter \u2013 one that usually doesn\u2019t even deliver a book\u2019s worth of analysis in that year \u2013 an ebook is a great deal. But it\u2019s also what pays for most of the newsletter. Ultimately, people buying the ebooks is what gives writers like me the time and space to write our newsletters in the first place. So, for this Black Friday \u2013 running until Monday, 1 December \u2013 I\u2019m bringing back my Everything Bundle , which contains all of my ebooks, for one last hurrah. The end of the \u2018Everything Bundle\u2019 # Four ebooks for \u20ac49 EUR , at an almost 60% discount off the combined price. What\u2019s more, after the Black Friday sale, I\u2019m going to discontinue two of the four ebooks. I am Uncluttered (Yellow) will only be available in the print edition and the archival ebook Bad Writing will no longer be on sale for the foreseeable future. I\u2019m still happy with the books \u2013 genuinely proud of them, even \u2013 but I need to, well, unclutter the books I offer, and it makes sense to de-emphasise books that are targeting web development, the one industry that seems less likely to recover from it\u2019s infatuation with Large Language Models or React in the near future. The \u20ac49 EUR bundle includes: Out of the Software Crisis: Systems-Thinking for Software Projects , an opinionated guide to the systems-thinking perspective on software development. The Intelligence Illusion: a practical guide to the business risks of Generative AI , an overview of the many risks and pitfalls of using generative models in your business backed by in-depth research. I am Uncluttered (Yellow): doom-prepping web dev through disdain, disrespect, and doing the right thing . Bad Writing and Other Essays: Twenty-Five Years of Writing About the Digital Transformation Buy the Everything Bundle for \u20ac49 EUR Out of the Software Crisis # Software projects keep failing, not because we don\u2019t have the right team or tools but because our software development system is broken. Out of the Software Crisis is a guide to fixing your software projects with systems-thinking making them more resilient to change and less likely to fail. Praise for Out of the Software Crisis # The only issue so far with @baldur\u2019s book is how distracted I am by the typography. It\u2019s a bit too good \ud83d\ude05 David Larlet I\u2019ve bought your book based solely on the extract about the business value of unit testing on the website. I read that and thought \u201cYES! At last! Someone\u2019s said it.\u201d and wondered what else you have to say. I\u2019m looking forward to reading it. :) Chris Neale I read @baldur\u2019s book \u2018Out of the Software Crisis\u2019 on the flight over yesterday and I\u2019d strongly recommend reading it. The book tries to frame a lot of software failures by moving up an abstraction from tactics like \u201chey did you assign the right story points\u201d to a more nuanced look at how companies manage software as a whole Hoping to beat my roughly 50/50 ratio of big software projects succeeding in my career with (Thing I\u2019m working on) and this book gives me new primitives for thinking about it. Orta Therox Reading Out Of The Software Crisis by @baldur and this hits hard: \u201cMost software companies overshoot their software development system complexity by a substantial margin because the margins on software businesses are so good. When times are good, everything you do seems to lead to growth. You begin to associate your random actions with random fluctuations in the market. Managers build mental models for how the market works that have no relation with reality.\u201d This is basically a book full of hot takes and I\u2019m here for it. James Harton \u201cOut of the Software Crisis\u201d by @baldur is a great book and well worth the read. Highly quotable, and really challenged my view of software development in a few places. Too many great quotes, but here\u2019s one that hit me in the gut: \u201cTruly catastrophic software failures rarely get discovered in a sprint review or shipping retrospectives. The serious bugs that induce panic attacks only appear once the software is distributed widely enough to begin to experience edge cases. Most of the time, that only happens long after the software development team has moved on and marked the project as successful or challenged.\u201d Nolan Lawson Love this quote about design from \u201cOut of the software crisis\u201d by @fakebaldur: \u201cDecoration [is] the least important thing design does for software\u2026[aesthetics] is part of what design does. It isn\u2019t what you hire designers to do.\u201d Jim Neilsen Really great as an introduction to systems thinking as applied to software design. It isn\u2019t used as much as a guide or resource, but as a way to get a lay of the land. Jennifer Jiang This book \u201cout of the software crisis\u201d by @baldurbjarnason is really good \ud83d\udc4d I cannot recommend it highly enough KimSia Sim Just finished @baldur\u2019s new book \u201cOut of the Software Crisis\u201d. It\u2019s a whistle-stop tour of the history and current state of #software development, and an intro to systems thinking. Very relatable if you\u2019re a #webdev, and has inspired me to read more\u2026 Ben Walker \u201cOut of the Software Crisis\u201d by @baldur is so good that I shared it with our executive management team. It\u2019s short, non-technical, well-researched and identifies the key reasons software projects fail and how to improve the chance of success. Hoping this authoritative little book will help our team look beyond the waterfall/agile/safe/whatever dogmas to the importance of the wider organization in determining success. @doctorlaura Full price: \u20ac35 EUR Buy the Everything Bundle for \u20ac49 EUR The Intelligence Illusion # A practical guide to the business risks of Generative AI What are the major risks to avoid with generative AI? How do you avoid having it blow up in your face? Is that even possible? The Intelligence Illusion is an exhaustively researched guide to the risks of language and diffusion models. Praise for The Intelligence Illusion: a practical guide to the business risks of Generative AI # Amid the current AI tsunami, I knew it was time to do my share of learning this stuff by filling gaps among pieces of my fragmented knowledge about it and organize my thoughts around it. This book served that purpose very well. Generative AI, ChatGPT and sorts, have been released prematurely with too many, too much downsides for possible benefits. It\u2019s especially so when it comes to commercial use. This book walk you through possible risks your business might encounter if you casually incorporate it. Many of his arguments opened my eyes. I\u2019m glad I found his book at this timing. It\u2019s a hype, at least for now and a foreseeable future. Use cases will likely be very limited. And to protect ourselves from bad actors, we need solid regulations, just like in the case of crypto. yasuhiro yoshida \u5409\u7530\u5eb7\u6d69 The Intelligence Illusion is full of practical down-to-earth advice based on plenty of research backed up with copious citations. I\u2019m only halfway through it and it\u2019s already helped me separate the hype from the reality. Jeremy Keith Should we build xGPT into our product? Before you answer, make sure to take advantage of all the homework Baldur Bjarnason has done for you. Brandon Rohrer Back when I worked in publishing, I employed Baldur Bjarnason as a consultant on complex digital publishing projects, as I appreciated his ability to grasp technical detail and translate it into terms that a general manager could understand - and act upon. He has applied that same skill to a superb new ebook on the business risks of generative AI, which I was lucky enough to read in advance of publication. It combines deep research, logical analysis and clear business recommendations. George Walkley I bought it, and I read most of it (skimming the middle part), and it is brilliant. Thank you! Matthias B\u00fcchse I just bought the book this morning and it\u2019s exactly what I needed. I have not seen a clearer description of how generative AI works, what it might be good for, and what the risks are. The references alone are worth the price of the book. Dave Cramer When it comes to the current hype surrounding AGI and LLMs, whether you\u2019re a true skeptic (like me) or a true believer, The Intelligence Illusion is a splash of lemon juice in the greasy pool of incredulous media coverage. Accessible for anyone who\u2019s spent more than 15 minutes with a clueless executive or myopic developer (or, frankly, engaged with any of the technological \u201cdisruptions\u201d of the past two decades), Bjarnason rigorously unpacks the many risks involved with the most popular use cases being promoted by unscrupulous executives. He brings plenty of receipts to support his observations, too, while also spotlighting areas where this technology might have legitimate potential for good. Highly recommended! PS: The images throughout do an amazing job of subtly reinforcing the book\u2019s title and premise and would be worthy of a print edition.

Most of the time, that only happens long after the software development team has moved on and marked the project as successful or challenged.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://toot.cafe/@nolan/109395899173521273\">Nolan Lawson</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Love this quote about design from \u201cOut of the software crisis\u201d by @fakebaldur: \u201cDecoration [is] the least important thing design does for software\u2026[aesthetics] is part of what design does.

He brings plenty of receipts to support his observations, too, while also spotlighting areas where this technology might have legitimate potential for good.

Are we still doing that? \u2014 and welcome to the busiest two-week stretch of awards season by far. This is the part where we start seeing some nominees and winners, so at last everyone gets to participate! Tonight, the Gotham Awards will be held in New York, where, in addition to the competitive categories, tribute awards will be handed out for the talent behind Frankenstein , Sinners , Jay Kelly , Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere , Hedda , After the Hunt and Song Sung Blue . Even if the Gotham winners don\u2019t necessarily port over to the rest of awards season \u2014 last year\u2019s best feature winner, A Different Man , received just a single Oscar nomination, for its hair and makeup work \u2014 it\u2019s something close to an East Coast version of the Governors Awards . Basically, it\u2019s an opportunity to see a whole lot of famous people work the room at the same time. My colleague Christopher Rosen will be there to watch it all unfold, and we\u2019ll go live on Substack tomorrow at 9 a.m. ET to discuss both the Gotham Awards and my big plans tonight: seeing Avatar: Fire and Ash at one of its first press and industry screenings. Our conversation will also be on this week\u2019s Prestige Junkie podcast, but if you\u2019re up early, please join us in the comments! If you weren\u2019t keeping a close eye on the podcast feed over the weekend , you may have missed the first of several bonus Saturday interviews we\u2019ll be sharing, with Dwayne Johnson kicking things off to talk about The Smashing Machine. If it\u2019s a busy part of awards season, you\u2019d better believe the podcast will be busy, too. We\u2019ll be back on Substack Live on Friday as well, this time joined by our returning, beloved Joyce Eng to break down the other big awards news of the week: the TV and film nominations from the Critics Choice Awards. Look for a link to that conversation in Thursday\u2019s newsletter. But if you can\u2019t join us live, the replay will be available only to paid Prestige Junkie After Party subscribers. Just $5 a month will get you access to that, my recent Avatar flashback episode with Griffin Newman , our explanation of how the NFL and Oscar season are basically the same and so much more. Don\u2019t miss out! Subscribe to Prestige Junkie After Party The days ahead stay wild: On Tuesday, the New York Film Critics Circle will announce its winners, Wednesday brings the Film Independent Spirit Awards nominations and the National Board of Review winners and Sunday is the Los Angeles Film Critics Association\u2019s time to shine. Next week are the Golden Globe Award nominations and the start of Oscar shortlist voting. The following week is the start of voting for the Producers Guild Awards, Directors Guild Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards (excuse me, the Actor Awards ) \u2014 plus the announcement of the Oscar shortlists in categories such as score, song, international feature and more. So, much to do before Hollywood hunkers down for the holidays, and Oscar voters, hopefully, really get cracking on those FYC screeners! Between this newsletter and the podcast, there will be a whole lot to talk about between now and Christmas. Thanks for being along for the ride! Share Subscribe now Turkey Leftovers WITCHY WOMAN Wicked: For Good star Cynthia Erivo at the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade on Thursday. (The Hapa Blonde/GC Images) Before I get to today\u2019s conversation with Roofman co-stars and millennial icons Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst , let me share the text I received early on Thanksgiving morning from the intrepid Chris Rosen: \u201cThanksgiving parade Oscar campaign in full effect.\u201d I had already posted as much on Bluesky , marveling at seeing Cynthia Erivo open the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade and make it look effortless despite the exhausting Wicked: For Good press tour she\u2019d just wrapped up. There was One Battle After Another star and best supporting actress contender Teyana Taylor performing her 2020 song \u201cMade It\u201d on the float sponsored by Peacock. And, still a significant event even months after KPop Demon Hunters conquered the world, the Huntri/x trio of EJAE, Rei Ami and Audrey Nuna performed \u201cGolden\u201d on live television for the first time. (In my house full of children under 10, it was an event worth sitting through endless rounds of commercial breaks.) Naturally, I wish that more Oscar contenders would go this full-bore into the parade \u2014 if we can have a Derpy Tiger balloon , why not the actual Marty Supreme orange blimp flying overhead, or a float paying tribute to the medicinal herbs of Hamnet ? But mostly this felt like confirmation that we\u2019re in for an especially populist awards season, with multiple contenders so widely known they can be headliners at one of the most mainstream TV events of the year. Oscar telecast producers eternally in search of higher ratings can probably take heart from the numbers for this year\u2019s parade \u2014 and ideally find a way also to incorporate the Saja Boys from KPop Demon Hunters , to boost those numbers a bit higher. Share Subscribe now Raise the Roofman One of the most endearing and surprising things about Roofman , the Paramount release from earlier this fall, is how hard it is to define its tone. It\u2019s competing at the Golden Globes as a comedy, and its posters feature star Channing Tatum wearing a pink pool float around his waist and an enormous teddy bear on his shoulders. That happens in the movie, sure, but so do several emotionally fraught robberies, painful breakups and a transcendently sad scene with a church choir. Being that bittersweet is tough for any movie to pull off, and it felt particularly surprising coming from director Derek Cianfrance , whose films Blue Valentine and The Place Beyond the Pines , and the TV series I Know This Much Is True , all leaned even more heavily into tragedy. So when I caught up with Tatum and co-star Kirsten Dunst a few weeks ago, I wanted to ask how Cianfrance helped them see his vision, which turns a weird-but-true premise \u2014 an escaped convict named Jeffrey Manchester hides out in a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and sparks a romance with a woman who works there \u2014 into something genuinely heartfelt. As it turns out, that delicate tone took them by surprise as well. As Tatum and Dunst tell it, they put their faith in Cianfrance and let the rest follow. \u201cDerek loves performance,\u201d Tatum, 45, told me, with Dunst, 43, sitting by his side, doing a fresh round of press together months after the Paramount film had opened ( Roofman is available to rent now at various digital platforms). Encouraging his actors to change up their performances from take to take, Cianfrance \u201chas about seven different movies in the can,\u201d Tatum continues. \u201cHe could make a full-on comedy, or there\u2019s an even darker version that would just break your heart. I looked at him so many times like, \u2018I have no idea how you\u2019re going to go into a dark room with all this footage and all the different stuff that we did and carve out what the tone of this movie is going to be.\u2019\u201d THROUGH THE ROOF Me, left, on Zoom with Tatum and Dunst. Dunst remembers filming the emotional final scene between her character, Leigh, and Tatum\u2019s, after their short-lived but sweet romance had run its course. Leigh might have plenty of reasons to hate Jeffrey \u2014 he\u2019s lied both to her and her two daughters, not only about living in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us but also about his past as the armed robber nicknamed \u201cthe Roofman.\u201d But the scene is much more about Leigh extending him grace, and a shared gratitude for what they shared. If you\u2019re an actor filming it the traditional way, with the camera capturing one actor\u2019s side of the scene, then switching places to focus on the other, it\u2019s the kind of thing that\u2019s hard to do twice. Instead, Cianfrance set up two cameras and let his actors cook. \u201cA lot of directors wouldn\u2019t sacrifice the shot to shoot us both at the same time,\u201d Dunst says. \u201cHe knows the most important, valuable thing is the authenticity of the performance. He likes the feeling of life rather than anything stilted or performative, and that\u2019s the kind of acting that I like.\u201d As my colleague Richard Rushfield has so convincingly argued , Dunst has a better track record for working with great directors than basically any other actor alive, including Oscar winners Barry Levinson , Jane Campion and Sofia Coppola . Tatum has worked with his share of greats as well (Oscar winners Steven Soderbergh , Joel and Ethan Coen and Quentin Tarantino ), but has still rarely gotten the chance to explore the level of nuance and well-earned emotional depth that are key to Roofman . You can hear how special it was in the way Tatum talks about Cianfrance, but also the way he talks about his character, whose penchant for telling himself stories and adopting new identities doesn\u2019t make him sound all that different from an actor. \u201cHe was telling himself a fantasy to justify whatever his behavior wanted to be,\u201d Tatum says of Manchester, who in real life has been back in prison since the events depicted in Roofman . \u201cI think I\u2019ve definitely done that in my life. I think everybody tells themselves stories. I\u2019m a different person now with you than I am with my daughter. We all wear masks.\u201d Living out a child\u2019s fantasy of sleeping in a toy store and eating nothing but candy, Roofman \u2019s Manchester represents an extreme kind of arrested development. But what 40-something hasn\u2019t found themselves shocked at being the adult in the room? As our conversation wrapped up, I asked Dunst if she related to what Tatum told Variety a few months ago \u2014 \u201cIn my mind, I\u2019m still literally 30 years old \u2014 26, if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d Dunst replied that her job as an actor is to keep her \u201cchildlike qualities at the forefront,\u201d and she prides herself on being a \u201cfun mom\u201d to the boys she shares with her husband, Jesse Plemons . \u201cSometimes the school calls me, and I want to laugh,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I\u2019m like, oh, this person\u2019s acting very adult with me, so I\u2019m going to pretend to be very adult now.\u201d When I told them I had to end our call so I could make it to a school board meeting, Dunst gave me a crisp salute \u2014 from one so-called adult to another.

There was <em>One Battle After Another</em> star and best supporting actress contender <strong>Teyana Taylor</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1cCMD-4P_s\">performing her 2020 song</a> &#8220;Made It&#8221; on the float sponsored by Peacock. And, still a significant event even <a href=\"https://theankler.com/p/tiff-day-1-netflixs-golden-moment\">months after</a> <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>conquered the world, the Huntri/x trio of <strong>EJAE, Rei Ami</strong> and <strong>Audrey Nuna</strong> performed &#8220;Golden&#8221; on live television for the first time. (In my house full of children under 10, it was an event worth sitting through endless rounds of commercial breaks.)</p><div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-VoxVz2OPPQ4\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div><p>Naturally, I wish that more Oscar contenders would go this full-bore into the parade &#8212; if we can have a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VqUA3MJsjN8\">Derpy Tiger balloon</a>, why not the actual <em>Marty Supreme</em> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@a24/video/7574851604323519757\">orange blimp</a> flying overhead, or a float paying tribute to the medicinal herbs of <em>Hamnet</em>? But mostly this felt like confirmation that we&#8217;re in for an especially populist awards season, with multiple contenders so widely known they can be headliners at one of the most mainstream TV events of the year. Oscar telecast producers eternally in search of higher ratings can probably take heart from <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/2025-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-ratings-nbc-peacock-1236437256/\">the numbers for this year&#8217;s parade</a> &#8212; and ideally find a way also to incorporate the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=983bBbJx0Mk\">Saja Boys</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>, to boost those numbers a bit higher.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://theankler.com/p/channing-tatum-and-kirsten-dunst-prestige-junkie-interview?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://theankler.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zGxG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46e0fbab-0cf7-4578-8bb2-c8a839f3be16_750x4.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"4\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zGxG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46e0fbab-0cf7-4578-8bb2-c8a839f3be16_750x4.png\" width=\"750\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2><strong>Raise the </strong><em><strong>Roofman</strong></em></h2><div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-GXecSGmQDEI\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div><p><strong>One of the most</strong> endearing and surprising things about <em>Roofman</em>, the Paramount release from earlier this fall, is how hard it is to define its tone. It&#8217;s competing at the Golden Globes as a comedy, and its <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4627382/mediaviewer/rm744537602/?ref_=tt_ov_i\">posters</a> feature star Channing Tatum wearing a pink pool float around his waist and an enormous teddy bear on his shoulders. That happens in the movie, sure, but so do several emotionally fraught robberies, painful breakups and a transcendently sad scene with a church choir.</p><p>Being that bittersweet is tough for any movie to pull off, and it felt particularly surprising coming from director <strong>Derek Cianfrance</strong>, whose films <em>Blue Valentine</em> and <em>The Place Beyond the Pines</em>, and the TV series <em>I Know This Much Is True</em>, all leaned even more heavily into tragedy. So when I caught up with Tatum and co-star Kirsten Dunst a few weeks ago, I wanted to ask how Cianfrance helped them see his vision, which turns a <a href=\"https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/roofman-true-story-jeffrey-manchester-rcna236165\">weird-but-true</a> premise &#8212; an escaped convict named <strong>Jeffrey Manchester</strong> hides out in a Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us and sparks a romance with a woman who works there &#8212; into something genuinely heartfelt.</p><p>As it turns out, that delicate tone took them by surprise as well. As Tatum and Dunst tell it, they put their faith in Cianfrance and let the rest follow. &#8220;Derek loves performance,&#8221; Tatum, 45, told me, with Dunst, 43, sitting by his side, doing a fresh round of press together months after the Paramount film had opened (<em>Roofman</em> is available to rent now at various digital platforms). Encouraging his actors to change up their performances from take to take, Cianfrance &#8220;has about seven different movies in the can,&#8221; Tatum continues. &#8220;He could make a full-on comedy, or there&#8217;s an even darker version that would just break your heart. I looked at him so many times like, &#8216;I have no idea how you&#8217;re going to go into a dark room with all this footage and all the different stuff that we did and carve out what the tone of this movie is going to be.&#8217;&#8221;</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fiL3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd589d1d4-e99a-415d-80dd-8a51939222fe_1600x771.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"702\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fiL3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd589d1d4-e99a-415d-80dd-8a51939222fe_1600x771.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><strong>THROUGH THE </strong><em><strong>ROOF</strong></em><strong> </strong>Me, left, on Zoom with Tatum and Dunst.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Dunst remembers filming the emotional final scene between her character, Leigh, and Tatum&#8217;s, after their short-lived but sweet romance had run its course. Leigh might have plenty of reasons to hate Jeffrey &#8212; he&#8217;s lied both to her and her two daughters, not only about living in the Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us but also about his past as the armed robber nicknamed &#8220;the Roofman.&#8221; But the scene is much more about Leigh extending him grace, and a shared gratitude for what they shared. If you&#8217;re an actor filming it the traditional way, with the camera capturing one actor&#8217;s side of the scene, then switching places to focus on the other, it&#8217;s the kind of thing that&#8217;s hard to do twice.</p><p>Instead, Cianfrance set up two cameras and let his actors cook. &#8220;A lot of directors wouldn&#8217;t sacrifice the shot to shoot us both at the same time,&#8221; Dunst says. &#8220;He knows the most important, valuable thing is the authenticity of the performance. He likes the feeling of life rather than anything stilted or performative, and that&#8217;s the kind of acting that I like.&#8221;</p><p>As my colleague <strong>Richard Rushfield</strong> <a href=\"https://theankler.com/p/sports-fix-hollywood-paramount-cannes-dunst\">has so convincingly argued</a>, Dunst has a <a href=\"https://theankler.com/p/bradley-coopers-balls-and-kirsten\">better track record</a> for working with great directors than basically any other actor alive, including Oscar winners <strong>Barry Levinson</strong>, <strong>Jane Campion </strong>and <strong>Sofia Coppola</strong>. Tatum has worked with his share of greats as well (Oscar winners <strong>Steven Soderbergh</strong>, <strong>Joel </strong>and <strong>Ethan Coen</strong> and <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong>), but has still rarely gotten the chance to explore the level of nuance and well-earned emotional depth that are key to <em>Roofman</em>. You can hear how special it was in the way Tatum talks about Cianfrance, but also the way he talks about his character, whose penchant for telling himself stories and adopting new identities doesn&#8217;t make him sound all that different from an actor.</p><p>&#8220;He was telling himself a fantasy to justify whatever his behavior wanted to be,&#8221; Tatum says of Manchester, who in real life has been back in prison since the events depicted in <em>Roofman</em>. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve definitely done that in my life. I think everybody tells themselves stories. I&#8217;m a different person now with you than I am with my daughter. We all wear masks.&#8221;</p><p>Living out a child&#8217;s fantasy of sleeping in a toy store and eating nothing but candy, <em>Roofman</em>&#8217;s Manchester represents an extreme kind of arrested development. But what 40-something hasn&#8217;t found themselves shocked at being the adult in the room? As our conversation wrapped up, I asked Dunst if she related to what Tatum told <em><a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/features/channing-tatums-roofman-avengers-doomsday-1236502009/\">Variety</a></em> a few months ago &#8212; &#8220;In my mind, I&#8217;m still literally 30 years old &#8212; 26, if I&#8217;m being honest.&#8221;</p><p>Dunst replied that her job as an actor is to keep her &#8220;childlike qualities at the forefront,&#8221; and she prides herself on being a &#8220;fun mom&#8221; to the boys she shares with her husband, <strong>Jesse Plemons</strong>. &#8220;Sometimes the school calls me, and I want to laugh,&#8221; she says. &#8220;That&#8217;s when I&#8217;m like, oh, this person&#8217;s acting very adult with me, so I&#8217;m going to pretend to be very adult now.&#8221;</p><p>When I told them I had to end our call so I could make it to a school board meeting, Dunst gave me a crisp salute &#8212; from one so-called adult to another.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://theankler.com/p/channing-tatum-and-kirsten-dunst-prestige-junkie-interview/comments\"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr /></div><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://thealabamasolution.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q_6x!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98b6cb66-84e8-4bd2-9023-e69ee1dae0ea_300x600.jpeg\" width=\"300\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div>"

        "full_content": "L ast week, Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s government and Alberta premier Danielle Smith did something many thought politically impossible: they agreed to a new oil pipeline cutting to the British Columbia coast, designed to move bitumen to foreign markets. Their memorandum of understanding (or MOU, a non-binding blueprint for where both governments want to go) lays out the high-stakes deal: Ottawa signals a willingness to ease up on key climate rules and even revisit the BC tanker moratorium. In return, Alberta promises tougher carbon pricing for heavy industry and a major expansion in carbon capture projects\u2014emerging technology meant to trap emissions from oil sands operations and bury them underground\u2014alongside a privately financed pipeline with Indigenous co-ownership. BC wasn\u2019t brought into the room, and it shows. The province is furious, warning that the MOU weakens coastal protections, heightens spill risk, and resurrects a fight many thought was finally behind us. Several First Nations and environmental groups have already come out swinging. To get past the talking points, I spoke with Stewart Prest, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia, about what\u2019s actually inside the agreement\u2014and what it might unleash. What\u2019s the national interest argument here? Why is Carney doing this now? I think he sees a need to bridge the gap between Canada, its mainstream political movements, and the more populist right-of-centre political movements, which are very much centred on Alberta and the energy sector. That\u2019s not the only issue that they care about, but it\u2019s clearly one of the primary drivers: grievances around Alberta\u2019s ability to access foreign markets with its energy production. I think Carney sees this as a kind of grand bargain, an opportunity to bring together these two sides, which are so divided. It is really the primary line of polarization, the fault line within Canadian politics right now. What\u2019s the national interest risk here? Why is this a bad idea? There are real risks with this strategy. Should it fail, it will provide fresh grievance to that populist group and become just another argument for why the two sides can never work together. And if it does fail, part of the reason will be because the agreement has so far been struck without the involvement of either the province of BC or Indigenous communities along the route of the proposed pipeline. Some of those communities are perhaps in favour of taking on an ownership stake and co-operating, but others, concerned about long-term risk to these ecologically sensitive areas, are ardently against the project. That potentially runs afoul of the government\u2019s constitutional obligation to consult with Indigenous groups in good faith. Other risks? The other downside for Carney is that, while he may have neutralized some of his opposition by looking like a Conservative prime minister, he is in danger of losing important components of his own coalition. The resignation of Steven Guilbeault, a former climate minister, from Carney\u2019s cabinet is an indicator that those who joined the Liberals under Justin Trudeau because they thought the government was acting in good faith on the environment no longer hold that view. Having voters conclude that a vote for the Liberals is effectively no different on these key issues than a vote for the Conservatives is about the only thing that can bring new life into either the New Democratic Party or the Greens; both of them look pretty morbid right now. And you don\u2019t need to have many voters switching back to one of these other progressive parties for the Conservatives to pop up into minority or even majority territory. Is there a scenario where Carney wins for losing? What I mean is, even if the pipeline fails, can he still benefit politically? I think neutralizing Smith, for however long this peace between the two sides lasts, will be to Carney\u2019s political advantage. It clearly puts opposition leader Pierre Poilievre in a very difficult situation. He is left criticizing the deal and its contents, which essentially puts him opposite of Smith and the Alberta firmament in the oil patch. The energy sector really likes this deal. Everything we\u2019re hearing is that it\u2019s Christmas come early for that sector. So, opposing it, for Poilievre, is unpalatable. But then what\u2019s his other alternative? To say Carney did a good job, and this is an effort that deserves the support of Conservatives across the country? I literally don\u2019t know if he\u2019s capable of saying that. Even after the election, where he was clearly humbled by the result, it was like pulling teeth for him to talk about supporting the government. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s his default setting. I don\u2019t even know if he possesses that setting. And so, over the short term, this clearly will work to Carney\u2019s political advantage in the Conservative-versus-Liberal divide. Is this actually an opportunity for BC? Could it demand concessions? They could try, but they have a pretty weak hand. The project is going ahead, full stop. So, it\u2019s either join the parade or get out of the way. Also, the federal government is already providing whatever support it can to several major economic development projects in BC, so effectively Carney can say, \u201cYou\u2019re already getting your part of the deal. We just expect you to play along here.\u201d Is this a risk, ultimately, to Canadian unity? The wording on the MOU says between Canada and Alberta\u2014not the government of Canada and the government of Alberta. It is a remarkable elevation of Alberta to the kind of champion of this so-called \u201cother\u201d voice in the country. Essentially, the MOU is saying that there\u2019s a new version of two nations in Canada, and it is mainstream politics versus its more populist counterpart. Alberta is the face of that populist politics. And BC is now a second-class citizen in the federation. The agreement happens between Alberta and Canada, and everyone else has to find their place\u2014and that includes BC and First Nations. More to the point, Carney has moved the federal government from a position of arbiter, regulator, and convener of the federation to an actor picking sides. Is there nothing BC can do to stop it? Its options are limited. Because this is a pipeline that traverses provincial boundaries, the federal government is the regulatory actor, constitutionally speaking. Welcome to the majesty and the mystery of our shaggy federation. If it were a pipeline just going through BC, then BC is the regulatory actor, but because it crosses a provincial boundary, the federal government is the regulator. Moreover, the federal government, given our highly centralized legislative structure, means that if the prime minister wants to go in a particular direction, as long as they have the confidence of the House, they can do it. So, the cabinet has considerable leeway here, and they\u2019re exercising it. But what specific options does BC have? It can lodge a constitutional objection that the federal government isn\u2019t doing its due diligence with regard to protection of the environment or in acting as a supporter for First Nations, who themselves can say the federal government is paying lip service to the idea of consultation. I actually think the MOU\u2019s language opens the federal government up to this legal challenge. The agreement gives the appearance of a done deal, leaving everyone else to fall in line, which is not the idea of good-faith consultation. My sense is coastal First Nations will be less concerned about the economic opportunities of an ownership stake in a pipeline and more concerned about long-term risk to ecologically sensitive areas. There\u2019s a reason why a tanker ban exists on that coast. I think I know the answer already, but it would be good to have you say it. How would a pipeline square with our climate targets? Not well? That\u2019s the short answer. There are environmental commitments as part of the MOU, but they tend to be very much in the future and relatively fuzzier. It\u2019s a further step away from a very concrete kind of activity like a price on carbon or a cap on industrial emissions today. We are moving away from that model, towards a future where we meet our targets using carbon capture technology that, in many ways, is still improving. Magical thinking is a strong term, but there is a certain amount of hopefulness to the mechanisms by which the country is planning to get to its commitments. This is very much in keeping with the way in which we used to approach environmental politics. It\u2019s actually something of a Stephen Harper\u2013era tactic. We would say, yes, we\u2019re absolutely going to do that. We don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get there, but we\u2019ll worry about that later. \u201cA Subjugation\u201d: First Nations Chiefs Blast Carney\u2019s Nation-Building Scheme First Nations Warn Carney\u2019s Push to Build Canada Could Tear It Apart Could an Indigenous-Owned Pipeline Be a Force for Good? Will they build the pipeline? That\u2019s almost the wrong question. The mindset matters more. If you take seriously the idea that the world is gradually, haltingly, but still assuredly moving towards a lower carbon future, the MOU means we will continue to invest significant resources in an older technology\u2014one that ties our economy much more closely to the production and export of bitumen, and to the carbon-based world more broadly. Maybe not now, maybe not in twenty years, but at some point in the future, we will have invested in a technology no longer marketable in a meaningful way. Clearly, there is still an appetite for oil, but we also see the intensity of emissions dropping around the planet, and we see a real move towards renewable resources and electric vehicles in places like China. Even amid the churn and upheaval of the Trump era, the transition is happening. We\u2019ve just decided not to pay any attention to it. How does it square with Carney\u2019s image as someone who cares about the environment? It\u2019s a fascinating question. We see a real division in immediate reactions. The first camp puts a lot of stock in Carney\u2019s reputation, not only as someone committed to the environment but as a really smart guy who has a plan and is going to pull off his objectives. He hasn\u2019t abandoned them, goes the thinking. He just has a clever way to achieve them that perhaps we don\u2019t totally understand yet. And the other side is saying that, given the threats to national unity and to the Canadian economy, Carney has put all that in abeyance to take care of first things first. We need to meet the needs of the moment and tend to less urgent issues at a later date. The problem with that strategy, of course, is that a later date never comes and we only keep dealing with the urgency of the moment. It does seem to confirm all the worst fears about Carney\u2019s commitment to First Nations consultation. This is like Exhibit A of what everyone was afraid was going to happen. I think the agreement with Alberta takes us much closer to that point people were worried about. We now have a body of evidence to suggest that, ultimately, when there is a choice between stewardship of the environment or investment in profitable industry, when there\u2019s a choice between a commitment to working with Indigenous peoples as partners or trying to get a profitable project through\u2014whatever the cost\u2014that Carney will pick profit. That impression will lock in unless there\u2019s a moment where this government really sits down with Indigenous communities who are opposed to the project, and really shows that it is willing to listen to what the communities are saying with an open mind. That means either being open to the possibility the project in its current conception can\u2019t go ahead because of the concerns being raised\u2014or, failing that, being open to the possibility that the concerns are real and require considerable thinking about how to do it in a way that is sensitive to an environmental area set aside by BC. I\u2019m assuming you mean the Great Bear Rainforest? Yes. Likely the pipeline terminus will be located somewhere in that region. GBR has been declared an environmental preserve. The rules governing it are complicated, but over the past decade, the province has been committed to protecting that coastline precisely because of resource development accelerating elsewhere across BC. That those considerations are being thrown out the window as soon as it becomes economically and politically expedient\u2014and to do it without even asking BC\u2014is a pretty clear indicator people are right to be concerned about Carney. Are we looking at an even angrier and more divided country than before? Carney is trying to find a way to make common cause with a disgruntled part of the country. But he\u2019s doing so in a way that will make other parts of Canada feel completely overlooked, and it\u2019s not even clear that this strategy, over the long term, will actually satisfy the demands of those disgruntled groups. It\u2019s not even clear that it is possible to satisfy a kind of maximalist position within the energy sector, or\u2014never mind the energy sector\u2014the voters within Alberta, who are committed to a more populist style of politics. Their skepticism might just run too deep. And so, as soon as there\u2019s a setback at any point along the way, this whole agreement can fall apart, and essentially you\u2019ll have a fresh round of grievances and, now, newly alienated parts of the country as well. There is, of course, a possibility that everyone gets used to the new normal. In my view, it\u2019s more likely this is setting up the federation for a contentious future in which it starts to turn on itself. Is Carney responding to the threat of American aggression by adopting a strategy that could divide us more effectively than any external force? He\u2019s going to put the federation under unprecedented new pressures. It\u2019s a different approach to deal making. Normally, when a decision affects multiple provinces, those provinces are at the table, represented either by the first minister or a senior cabinet minister, discussing things as a group. The discussions tend to be focused on finding a way for everyone to get on side. If discussions break down, a decision is taken. The courts are often the court of last resort, where those who lost the debate will have their day to oppose the decision and, failing that, live with the result. But there is a good-faith attempt to bring everyone together. When BC and Alberta quarrelled over previous pipelines, the federal government tried to remain a neutral and honest broker. And that\u2019s not the case here. Here we see a federal government deciding with another province what will happen in a third province without that third province being at the table. That\u2019s just a fundamentally different way to approach federal decision making, and it\u2019s a precedent that has the potential to be explosive. Imagine the reaction if the federal government sat down with Ontario to plan out a pipeline running through Quebec? The blowback would be extraordinary\u2014and for good reason. It would show a lack of respect for the limited but still real sovereignty that provinces have within the federation. They have jurisdiction for a reason: to represent the interests of their community. Respecting that, even if there isn\u2019t a constitutional requirement for it, is part of the job of keeping that federation together\u2014this very diverse and contested patchwork of interests we call a country, a country that seems to beat the odds in surviving and thriving in the way it does. But Carney\u2019s ploy of openly choosing sides\u2014I don\u2019t think anyone has ever tried that before. It could work out; people could grumble and get used to it. Then again, it might not. I side with not. The post Yeehaw, Alberta Is Getting a Pipeline (at BC\u2019s Cost) first appeared on The Walrus .",

The agreement gives the appearance of a done deal, leaving everyone else to fall in line, which is not the idea of good-faith consultation. My sense is coastal First Nations will be less concerned about the economic opportunities of an ownership stake in a pipeline and more concerned about long-term risk to ecologically sensitive areas. There&#8217;s a reason why a tanker ban exists on that coast.</p>\n<p><strong>I think I know the answer already, but it would be good to have you say it. How would a pipeline square with our climate targets?</strong></p>\n<p>Not well? That\u2019s the short answer. There <em>are</em> environmental commitments as part of the MOU, but they tend to be very much in the future and relatively fuzzier. It&#8217;s a further step away from a very concrete kind of activity like a price on carbon or a cap on industrial emissions today. We are moving away from that model, towards a future where we meet our targets using carbon capture technology that, in many ways, is still improving. Magical thinking is a strong term, but there is a certain amount of hopefulness to the mechanisms by which the country is planning to get to its commitments. This is very much in keeping with the way in which we used to approach environmental politics. It&#8217;s actually something of a Stephen Harper\u2013era tactic. We would say, yes, we&#8217;re absolutely going to do that. We don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re going to get there, but we&#8217;ll worry about that later.</p>\n<ul class=\"related\">\n<li><a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/a-subjugation-first-nations-chiefs-blast-carneys-nation-building-scheme/\">\u201cA Subjugation\u201d: First Nations Chiefs Blast Carney\u2019s Nation-Building Scheme</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/first-nations-warn-carneys-push-to-build-canada-risks-tearing-it-apart/\">First Nations Warn Carney\u2019s Push to Build Canada Could Tear It Apart</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/could-an-indigenous-owned-pipeline-be-a-force-for-good/\">Could an Indigenous-Owned Pipeline Be a Force for Good?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Will they build the pipeline?</strong></p>\n<p>That\u2019s almost the wrong question. The mindset matters more. If you take seriously the idea that the world is gradually, haltingly, but still assuredly moving towards a lower carbon future, the MOU means we will continue to invest significant resources in an older technology\u2014one that ties our economy much more closely to the production and export of bitumen, and to the carbon-based world more broadly. Maybe not now, maybe not in twenty years, but at some point in the future, we will have invested in a technology no longer marketable in a meaningful way. Clearly, there is still an appetite for oil, but we also see the intensity of emissions dropping around the planet, and we see a real move towards renewable resources and electric vehicles in places like China. Even amid the churn and upheaval of the Trump era, the transition is happening. We&#8217;ve just decided not to pay any attention to it.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it square with Carney&#8217;s image as someone who cares about the environment?</strong>  </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a fascinating question. We see a real division in immediate reactions. The first camp puts a lot of stock in Carney&#8217;s reputation, not only as someone committed to the environment but as a really smart guy who has a plan and is going to pull off his objectives. He hasn&#8217;t abandoned them, goes the thinking. He just has a clever way to achieve them that perhaps we don&#8217;t totally understand yet. And the other side is saying that, given the threats to national unity and to the Canadian economy, Carney has put all that in abeyance to take care of first things first. We need to meet the needs of the moment and tend to less urgent issues at a later date. The problem with that strategy, of course, is that a later date never comes and we only keep dealing with the urgency of the moment.</p>\n<p><strong>It does seem to confirm all the worst fears about Carney&#8217;s commitment to First Nations consultation. This is like Exhibit A of what everyone was afraid was going to happen.</strong></p>\n<p>I think the agreement with Alberta takes us much closer to that point people were worried about. We now have a body of evidence to suggest that, ultimately, when there is a choice between stewardship of the environment or investment in profitable industry, when there\u2019s a choice between a commitment to working with Indigenous peoples as partners or trying to get a profitable project through\u2014whatever the cost\u2014that Carney will pick profit. </p>\n<p>That impression will lock in unless there\u2019s a moment where this government really sits down with Indigenous communities who are opposed to the project, and really shows that it is willing to listen to what the communities are saying with an open mind. That means either being open to the possibility the project in its current conception can&#8217;t go ahead because of the concerns being raised\u2014or, failing that, being open to the possibility that the concerns are real and require considerable thinking about how to do it in a way that is sensitive to an environmental area set aside by BC.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m assuming you mean the Great Bear Rainforest?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Likely the pipeline terminus will be located somewhere in that region. GBR has been declared an environmental preserve. The rules governing it are complicated, but over the past decade, the province has been committed to protecting that coastline precisely because of resource development accelerating elsewhere across BC. That those considerations are being thrown out the window as soon as it becomes economically and politically expedient\u2014and to do it without even asking BC\u2014is a pretty clear indicator people are right to be concerned about Carney.</p>\n<p><strong>Are we looking at an even angrier and more divided country than before?</strong></p>\n<p>Carney is trying to find a way to make common cause with a disgruntled part of the country. But he&#8217;s doing so in a way that will make other parts of Canada feel completely overlooked, and it&#8217;s not even clear that this strategy, over the long term, will actually satisfy the demands of those disgruntled groups. It&#8217;s not even clear that it is <em>possible</em> to satisfy a kind of maximalist position within the energy sector, or\u2014never mind the energy sector\u2014the voters within Alberta, who are committed to a more populist style of politics. Their skepticism might just run too deep. And so, as soon as there&#8217;s a setback at any point along the way, this whole agreement can fall apart, and essentially you&#8217;ll have a fresh round of grievances and, now, newly alienated parts of the country as well. There is, of course, a possibility that everyone gets used to the new normal. In my view, it\u2019s more likely this is setting up the federation for a contentious future in which it starts to turn on itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Is Carney responding to the threat of American aggression by adopting a strategy that could divide us more effectively than any external force?</strong></p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to put the federation under unprecedented new pressures. It\u2019s a different approach to deal making. Normally, when a decision affects multiple provinces, those provinces are at the table, represented either by the first minister or a senior cabinet minister, discussing things as a group. The discussions tend to be focused on finding a way for everyone to get on side. If discussions break down, a decision is taken. The courts are often the court of last resort, where those who lost the debate will have their day to oppose the decision and, failing that, live with the result. But there is a good-faith attempt to bring everyone together. When BC and Alberta quarrelled over previous pipelines, the federal government tried to remain a neutral and honest broker.</p>\n<p><strong>And that\u2019s not the case here.</strong></p>\n<p>Here we see a federal government deciding with another province what will happen in a third province without that third province being at the table. That&#8217;s just a fundamentally different way to approach federal decision making, and it\u2019s a precedent that has the potential to be explosive. Imagine the reaction if the federal government sat down with Ontario to plan out a pipeline running through Quebec? The blowback would be extraordinary\u2014and for good reason. It would show a lack of respect for the limited but still real sovereignty that provinces have within the federation. They have jurisdiction for a reason: to represent the interests of their community. Respecting that, even if there isn&#8217;t a constitutional requirement for it, is part of the job of keeping that federation together\u2014this very diverse and contested patchwork of interests we call a country, a country that seems to beat the odds in surviving and thriving in the way it does. But Carney\u2019s ploy of openly choosing sides\u2014I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever tried that before. It could work out; people could grumble and get used to it. Then again, it might not. I side with not.</p>The post <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/alberta-bc-pipeline/\">Yeehaw, Alberta Is Getting a Pipeline (at BC\u2019s Cost)</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca\">The Walrus</a>."

A video forwarded here, a screenshot there, a joke made a little too close to real pain. At first it feels isolated. Then it becomes a pattern.

About how numb we are to real people and real events. I want to talk about how we\u2019ve turned other people\u2019s worst moments into something we pass around on our phones. To talk about that honestly, I need to mention something that happened in my demographic yesterday. Even mentioning it makes me uncomfortable. It feels like I\u2019m in danger of doing the exact thing I\u2019m criticizing, like I\u2019m turning that tragedy into a writing prompt. But I\u2019m not trying to. I\u2019m not looking for a grief aesthetic or a moment of moral clarity. This isn\u2019t about my feelings or my epiphany. It\u2019s just that pretending it didn\u2019t happen would feel dishonest, because it\u2019s exactly the kind of event that exposes who we\u2019ve become. There was a heaviness in the air yesterday. Six kids died in my town. A car crash. A fire. The kind of tragedy that makes your stomach clench before your mind even catches up. None of them were my friends, but I\u2019d crossed their paths in that loose, small-town way. A party. A mutual friend. A moment of recognition at a mall. Until yesterday they were people with lives, habits, inside jokes, group chats, futures. Now they\u2019re gone. As the news spread, there was that silent panic math. Checking group chats. Calling friends. Refreshing Instagram stories. Praying that the name of loved ones wasn\u2019t one of the six. There\u2019s something brutally communal about those minutes before confirmation, a whole community holding its breath at once. And then, just as the shock was settling, photos began circulating. Real photos. Not just of the wreckage. Not of the aftermath. But of their bodies. Burned beyond recognition. Carbonized in their seats. Something no stranger should ever see. Something that the families should never have to know exists, let alone stumble upon in groupchats. Yet there they were, flying across town at the speed of gossip. I saw a few. I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t ask to. Now it lives somewhere in the back of my skull like a splinter. I keep thinking about their parents. About the moment someone might have opened their phone and been confronted with the worst possible image of their child. How their last memory is now contaminated by an image that should have been protected, held back, shielded. I think about how terrified I would be to see someone I love in that state, reduced to something unhuman. There are no words for that. It\u2019s a violence that goes beyond the physical. It\u2019s a violence of memory. And the fact that this image was passed around like gossip? That part feels like a wound of its own. It made me think about how far we\u2019ve drifted from the old instinct to cover the body, to shield the eyes, to protect the dignity of the dead. Once, communities knew there were things the living shouldn\u2019t witness. Now we live inside a camera roll with no guardrails. Somewhere along the way, boundaries dissolved. The margins of empathy blurred until everything became content. Privacy stopped being a right and became a courtesy. Moments that should be protected are now converted instantly into something shareable, something shocking enough to earn a reaction. Not necessarily out of evil, but out of that modern reflex: if I saw it, you should see it too. And what unsettles me the most is how casual it is and the strange pride some people seem to feel while doing it. As if being the first to send the photo, the first to \u201cconfirm\u201d, the first to drop the most gruesome detail somehow grants them a weird victory. The digital equivalent of standing on a rooftop and screaming, I knew before you did. There\u2019s something deeply human about wanting to feel connected during tragedy, but something deeply warped about wanting to feel important because of it. We\u2019ve gotten too comfortable collapsing real lives into content. We turn people \u2014 breathing, laughing, annoying, complicated people \u2014 into posts. Into engagement. Into a momentary spike in impressions. And once you start seeing lives as headlines, it becomes easy to forget that behind every headline is a mother whose ears are ringing, a friend who can\u2019t swallow, a sibling answering the same question for the fiftieth time. We\u2019ve seen the trendification of tragedy happen in real time. People making TikToks about tragedies that aren\u2019t theirs. People performing a kind of sloppy, public mourning for audiences of strangers. Not out of real connection, but out of the instinct to insert themselves into the narrative. To be seen being affected. To mark themselves as relevant to the moment. Everyone wants to add their two cents, even when the jar is already overflowing. People who had no connection to what happened suddenly feel compelled to react publicly. Not to offer actual comfort, not to help, but to stay visible. To stay part of the conversation. It\u2019s like silence has become suspicious. If you don\u2019t post, you don\u2019t care. If you don\u2019t perform concern, you must not have any. It\u2019s wild, and not in the poetic sense. Wild in the unhinged sense. It\u2019s crazy how desensitised we\u2019ve become. How easily we balance devastation in one tab and self presentation in the next. How someone can post a death notice in the morning, share their brunch in the afternoon and squeeze in the classic \u201cdear friends, please drive safe\u201d message before uploading a video of themselves popping champagne. All of it stitched together with their outfit of the day. The seamless shift from loss to aesthetic. The way sorrow becomes a brief detour before the regularly scheduled content returns. It feels like we\u2019ve collectively forgotten that some moments deserve a pause. A little respect. Not performative grief threaded through curated highlights. Tributes make sense when they come from the center of someone\u2019s life, from the people who held their secrets or their hand or their dreams. But when someone who spoke to the victim once at a party suddenly posts a photo carousel with a paragraph about \u201chow fragile life is\u201d\u2026 it becomes less about grief and more about proximity Olympics. There\u2019s a name for that phenomenon. Grief Olympics . The race to claim the closest seat to tragedy. The sudden rush to scroll through thousands of pictures to post a blurry group photo from 2022 at a house party because you drank with the victim once and now want the world to know that you\u2019re devastated too. So you can caption the post: I can\u2019t believe this. Life is so short. Hashtag broken heart. Hashtag rest in peace. It\u2019s emotional opportunism dressed up as compassion. And the worst part? It muddies the waters for the people who are actually grieving. It drowns out the voices that matter. It turns someone\u2019s life, and someone\u2019s death, into a momentary spectacle. And then there\u2019s the part that annoys me in a different way. The collective morality parade that always appears after tragedy. The \u201chug your loved ones tonight\u201d captions. The \u201cdon\u2019t drink and drive\u201d recycled advice. The inspirational quotes about life being short. I understand awareness. I understand safety. I understand good intentions. But the timing is awful and the energy is self serving. It\u2019s like clockwork. A tragedy happens, and people start performing moral clarity as if grief were a stage and they\u2019re auditioning for the role of Most Responsible Citizen . The way people slide seamlessly from someone\u2019s death into their own anecdote about a time they \u201calmost crashed with the deceased driver last summer\u201d? It\u2019s tone-deaf at best, self centered at worst. For fuck\u2019s sake Jessica, I do not want to watch you turn someone else\u2019s death into your personal cautionary tale. Take that performance elsewhere. Write it in your diary. Tell your group chat. Anything but another black and white Instagram story under the guise of public service. What I\u2019m sick of, truly, viscerally, is the performance. The immediate rush to package tragedy into something sharable and meaningful. Something that makes you look thoughtful and concerned and wise. Something that makes you feel involved. Sometimes the kindest thing we can do is shut up. Sit with the discomfort. Sit with the fact that something awful has happened and nothing you post will redeem it. Grief doesn\u2019t need your commentary. Loss doesn\u2019t need a hashtag. And respect sure as hell doesn\u2019t need to be aesthetic. There has to be a way back to tenderness. To silence. To choosing not to post. Real grief doesn\u2019t need an audience, and respect doesn\u2019t require proof. Underneath all of this, the gore-sharing, the grief Olympics, the moral theater, is something real and ugly. A generation that mistakes visibility for virtue. A generation that thinks feeling something is only real once it\u2019s posted. A generation that has forgotten the sacredness of restraint. There are things we never need to say. There are moments we\u2019re never supposed to see. There are tragedies that deserve privacy. There are families who deserve gentleness. And there are boundaries that should never be crossed in the name of curiosity or clout. If anything, losing touch with our own capacity for care is the real tragedy of my generation. We\u2019ve become so used to witnessing pain through screens that we\u2019ve started adopting the logic of the screen: fast, numb, reaction-based, and forgettable. Maybe the real mourning will start when we learn how to look away again. Subscribe now Dear Paid Subscribers, I know I haven\u2019t dropped anything behind the velvet rope in a minute. I promise I haven\u2019t forgotten you. This piece just didn\u2019t feel right to monetize. I have a lot of paid posts coming soon though, and I\u2019m excited to share them with you.

It started small. A video forwarded here, a screenshot there, a joke made a little too close to real pain. <br />At first it feels isolated. Then it becomes a pattern. And at some point you realize it isn&#8217;t random anymore. It&#8217;s culture.</p><p>I want to talk about that culture. About how casual cruelty has become. About how numb we are to real people and real events. I want to talk about how we&#8217;ve turned other people&#8217;s worst moments into something we pass around on our phones.</p><p>To talk about that honestly, I need to mention something that happened in my demographic yesterday. Even mentioning it makes me uncomfortable. It feels like I&#8217;m in danger of doing the exact thing I&#8217;m criticizing, like I&#8217;m turning that tragedy into a writing prompt. But I&#8217;m not trying to. I&#8217;m not looking for a grief aesthetic or a moment of moral clarity. This isn&#8217;t about my feelings or my epiphany. It&#8217;s just that pretending it didn&#8217;t happen would feel dishonest, because it&#8217;s exactly the kind of event that exposes who we&#8217;ve become.</p><p>There was a heaviness in the air yesterday. Six kids died in my town. A car crash. A fire. The kind of tragedy that makes your stomach clench before your mind even catches up. None of them were my friends, but I&#8217;d crossed their paths in that loose, small-town way. A party. A mutual friend. A moment of recognition at a mall. <br />Until yesterday they were people with lives, habits, inside jokes, group chats, futures. Now they&#8217;re gone.</p><p>As the news spread, there was that silent panic math. Checking group chats. Calling friends. Refreshing Instagram stories. Praying that the name of loved ones wasn&#8217;t one of the six. There&#8217;s something brutally communal about those minutes before confirmation, a whole community holding its breath at once.</p><p>And then, just as the shock was settling, photos began circulating. Real photos. Not just of the wreckage. Not of the aftermath. But of their bodies. Burned beyond recognition. Carbonized in their seats. <br />Something no stranger should ever see. Something that the families should never have to know exists, let alone stumble upon in groupchats. Yet there they were, flying across town at the speed of gossip.</p><p>I saw a few. I didn&#8217;t want to. I didn&#8217;t ask to. Now it lives somewhere in the back of my skull like a splinter.</p><p>I keep thinking about their parents. About the moment someone might have opened their phone and been confronted with the worst possible image of their child. How their last memory is now contaminated by an image that should have been protected, held back, shielded. I think about how terrified I would be to see someone I love in that state, reduced to something unhuman. There are no words for that. It&#8217;s a violence that goes beyond the physical. It&#8217;s a violence of memory. And the fact that this image was passed around like gossip? That part feels like a wound of its own.</p><p>It made me think about how far we&#8217;ve drifted from the old instinct to cover the body, to shield the eyes, to protect the dignity of the dead. Once, communities knew there were things the living shouldn&#8217;t witness. Now we live inside a camera roll with no guardrails.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, boundaries dissolved. The margins of empathy blurred until everything became content. Privacy stopped being a right and became a courtesy. Moments that should be protected are now converted instantly into something shareable, something shocking enough to earn a reaction. Not necessarily out of evil, but out of that modern reflex: if I saw it, you should see it too.</p><p>And what unsettles me the most is how casual it is and the strange pride some people seem to feel while doing it. As if being the first to send the photo, the first to &#8220;confirm&#8221;, the first to drop the most gruesome detail somehow grants them a weird victory. The digital equivalent of standing on a rooftop and screaming, <em>I knew before you did.</em></p><p>There&#8217;s something deeply human about wanting to feel connected during tragedy, but something deeply warped about wanting to feel important because of it.</p><p>We&#8217;ve gotten too comfortable collapsing real lives into content. We turn people &#8212; breathing, laughing, annoying, complicated people &#8212; into posts. Into engagement. Into a momentary spike in impressions. And once you start seeing lives as headlines, it becomes easy to forget that behind every headline is a mother whose ears are ringing, a friend who can&#8217;t swallow, a sibling answering the same question for the fiftieth time.</p><p>We&#8217;ve seen the trendification of tragedy happen in real time. People making TikToks about tragedies that aren&#8217;t theirs. People performing a kind of sloppy, public mourning for audiences of strangers. Not out of real connection, but out of the instinct to insert themselves into the narrative. To be seen being affected. To mark themselves as relevant to the moment.</p><p>Everyone wants to add their two cents, even when the jar is already overflowing. People who had no connection to what happened suddenly feel compelled to react publicly. Not to offer actual comfort, not to help, but to stay visible. To stay part of the conversation. It&#8217;s like silence has become suspicious. If you don&#8217;t post, you don&#8217;t care. If you don&#8217;t perform concern, you must not have any.</p><p>It&#8217;s wild, and not in the poetic sense. Wild in the unhinged sense.</p><p>It&#8217;s crazy how desensitised we&#8217;ve become. How easily we balance devastation in one tab and self presentation in the next. How someone can post a death notice in the morning, share their brunch in the afternoon and squeeze in the classic &#8220;dear friends, please drive safe&#8221; message before uploading a video of themselves popping champagne. All of it stitched together with their outfit of the day. The seamless shift from loss to aesthetic. The way sorrow becomes a brief detour before the regularly scheduled content returns.</p><p>It feels like we&#8217;ve collectively forgotten that some moments deserve a pause. A little respect. Not performative grief threaded through curated highlights.</p><p>Tributes make sense when they come from the center of someone&#8217;s life, from the people who held their secrets or their hand or their dreams. But when someone who spoke to the victim once at a party suddenly posts a photo carousel with a paragraph about &#8220;how fragile life is&#8221;&#8230; it becomes less about grief and more about proximity Olympics.</p><p>There&#8217;s a name for that phenomenon. <em>Grief Olympics</em>. The race to claim the closest seat to tragedy. The sudden rush to scroll through thousands of pictures to post a blurry group photo from 2022 at a house party because you drank with the victim once and now want the world to know that you&#8217;re devastated too.

        "full_content": "In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin greets US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff prior to their talks in Moscow on August 6, 2025. (GAVRIIL GRIGOROV/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Steve Witkoff, a fellow real estate developer and frequent golf partner of President Trump, was appointed by Trump as special envoy for peace missions , tasked with negotiating a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Witkoff, a billionaire with no previous diplomatic experience, is in charge of mediating an extraordinarily complex international conflict, a role that requires him to be trusted by both Russia and Ukraine as an honest broker. An investigation by Popular Information reveals that, while serving in this role, Witkoff has maintained an active financial partnership with Len Blavatnik, a billionaire sanctioned by Ukraine over his ties to Russia. Witkoff and Blavatnik are co-developing a massive residential real estate project in New York City. The relationship raises additional questions about the nature of Witkoff\u2019s role. A transcript of an October 14 phone call leaked last week to Bloomberg News revealed that Witkoff has been coaching his Russian counterpart, Yuri Ushakov, and advising him on how to undermine an upcoming call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Witkoff advised Ushakov, the top foreign policy advisor of Russian President Vladimir Putin, that Putin should call Trump quickly, before a scheduled meeting with Zelenskyy. During the call, Witkoff recommended Putin \u201ccongratulate the president\u201d on the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, and praise Trump as \u201ca man of peace.\u201d That phone call took place on October 16 and appeared to have the desired impact. In a \u201c tense \u201c meeting with Zelenskyy the following day, Trump rejected Ukrainian requests for Tomahawk missiles. Further, in the leaked October 14 call , Witkoff appears to suggest that he partner with Russia to create the \u201cTrump plan\u201d to end the war in Ukraine. \u201cWe put a 20-point Trump plan together [for Gaza] that was 20 points for peace and I\u2019m thinking maybe we do the same thing with you,\u201d Witkoff said. \u201cMaybe [Putin] says to President Trump: you know, Steve and Yuri discussed a very similar 20-point plan to peace and that could be something that we think might move the needle a little bit.\u201d On October 20 , the United States produced a 28-point \u201cTrump plan\u201d which required Ukraine to cede significant territory to Russia, permanently abandon aspirations to join NATO, and limit the size of its army. It was less a peace plan than a laundry list of Russian demands . Indeed, Reuters reported that the Trump proposal, created by Witkoff, was based on \u201ca Russian-authored paper submitted to the Trump administration in October.\u201d (Witkoff\u2019s proposal has since been pared back in an effort to attract Ukrainian support.) All of which raises the question: Why does Witkoff appear to have so heavily favored Russia during the negotiations? The answer may be buried in Witkoff\u2019s 33-page financial disclosure form , quietly posted to the White House website in September. The document, known as form 278e, reveals that Witkoff has ongoing financial interests that link him to Russian oligarchs and others hostile to Ukrainian interests. In 2021, Witkoff partnered with billionaire Len Blavatnik to take over the project now known as One High Line, a massive luxury condo development in New York City\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood. In 2024, Witkoff and Blavatnik refinanced the development for $1.15 billion. Blavatnik, born in Soviet Ukraine, is a naturalized U.S. and UK citizen. He made his initial fortune investing in Russia alongside sanctioned Russian oligarch Victor Vekselberg . Among other ventures, Blavatnik and Veksberg acquired 40% of Tyumen Oil Company (TNK) for $800 million in 1997 and, in 2003, merged it with the Russian assets of BP. In 2013, Blavatnik and Veksberg sold their stake in the company, netting Blavatnik around $7 billion . Veksberg reportedly has \u201c close ties \u201c to Putin. Based on his connections to the Putin regime, Blavatnik was sanctioned by Ukraine in December 2023 for at least 10 years. Blavatnik claims to have divested from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, selling a valuable stake in an aluminum business he owned with Veksberg. Nevertheless, British politicians have faced criticism for accepting donations from Blavatnik in light of the Ukrainian sanctions. He also established the Blavatnik Fund for Innovation at Yale, which has become controversial . \u201cAs many of us have begun to learn more about Kremlin-associated oligarchs, we\u2019re deeply uncomfortable with being affiliated with these awards,\u201d Aaron Ring, a recipient of the award, told Yale News in 2022. As Witkoff serves as Trump\u2019s top negotiator to end the war in Ukraine, Blavatnik remains Witkoff\u2019s most important business partner. The 278e form reveals that Witkoff has maintained his ownership stake in 76 Eleventh Avenue Property Owner LLC, part of his \u201cresidential real estate\u201d holding in New York City, and a subsidiary of WG 76 11th LLC. The value of the parent LLC is listed at $50 million or more, the highest valuation category. 76 Eleventh Avenue Property Owner LLC is the entity selling the condos at One High Line, according to a public document posted by the development. Witkoff is also partnered with Blavatnik on Ocean Terrace , an ultra-luxury condo development in Miami. Witkoff\u2019s form lists Ocean Terrace Owners LLC and related entities. While the project is still under construction, there have been hundreds of millions in pre-sales . What is missing from Witkoff\u2019s federal disclosure One of the primary purposes of the federal disclosure form is to ensure that the filer is in compliance with the conflict of interest provisions of federal law. All forms must be reviewed by a federal ethics official within 60 days of filing. The federal official then signs the form, certifying that \u201con the basis of information contained in this report, I conclude that the filer is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\u201d But while Witkoff signed his form on August 13, the version posted to the White House website remains unsigned . This is not an oversight. On November 17, Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) sent a letter to the White House Counsel and the Office of Government ethics noting that \u201cno agency ethics official signed the form\u2026 even though the 60-day deadline for an ethics official to review his form passed in October 2025.\u201d The Senators say the form \u201cappears to have inaccurate or incomplete information.\u201d One issue is that Witkoff\u2019s form does not provide full transparency about what financial assets Witkoff currently owns. The form does reveal that Witkoff \u201c sold an interest in his eponymous real estate management company for $120 million \u201c as \u201cpart of divestiture planning.\u201d But he continues to own a portion of the Witkoff Group valued at more than $50 million, according to the same form. So he has not actually divested from the company. Further, a partial stake in the Witkoff Group, a private real estate company, is an illiquid asset. So who did Witkoff sell his stake to? Witkoff has not disclosed the buyer. It could be a family member, such as his son Alex Witkoff, who is currently running the company. Such a sale would do little to assuage concerns about conflict. Diplomacy or kleptocracy? In addition to his current partnership with Blavatnik, Witkoff is ideally positioned to financially benefit from a peace deal if it includes unfreezing Russian assets. Witkoff appears to be focused on maximizing investment opportunities. In an unusual move, Witkoff hammered out the peace plan not with a Russian foreign affairs official but with Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund (RDIF). In 2022, Dmitriev was sanctioned by the United States and banned from the country for his role at the RDIF, which the Treasury Department described as \u201ca slush fund for President Vladimir Putin and\u2026 emblematic of Russia\u2019s broader kleptocracy.\u201d Despite the sanctions, Witkoff requested Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent allow Dmitriev to travel to DC in April. Bessent reportedly \u201chad questions about the unique request, but ultimately signed off.\u201d Since then, Witkoff and Dmitriev have met multiple times in person, in Moscow and elsewhere, and chatted frequently on the phone. Last month Witkoff and Dmitriev met in Miami to finalize the \u201cTrump plan.\u201d The 28-point plan specifically contemplates using Russian assets to facilitate American investment.

(GAVRIIL GRIGOROV/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Steve Witkoff, a fellow real estate developer and frequent golf partner of President Trump, was appointed by Trump as <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/07/03/2025-12505/establishing-a-white-house-office-for-special-peace-missions\">special envoy for peace missions</a>, tasked with negotiating a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Witkoff, a billionaire with no previous diplomatic experience, is in charge of mediating an extraordinarily complex international conflict, a role that requires him to be trusted by both Russia and Ukraine as an honest broker.</p><p>An investigation by Popular Information reveals that, while serving in this role, Witkoff has maintained an active financial partnership with Len Blavatnik, a billionaire sanctioned by Ukraine over his ties to Russia. Witkoff and Blavatnik are co-developing a massive residential real estate project in New York City. The relationship raises additional questions about the nature of Witkoff&#8217;s role.</p><p>A transcript of an October 14 phone call <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/witkoff-advised-russia-on-how-to-pitch-ukraine-plan-to-trump\">leaked</a> last week to Bloomberg News revealed that Witkoff has been coaching his Russian counterpart, Yuri Ushakov, and advising him on how to undermine an upcoming call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>Witkoff advised Ushakov, the top foreign policy advisor of Russian President Vladimir Putin, that Putin should call Trump quickly, before a scheduled meeting with Zelenskyy. During the call, Witkoff recommended Putin &#8220;congratulate the president&#8221; on the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, and praise Trump as &#8220;a man of peace.&#8221; That phone call took place on <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/16/trump-putin-call-zelensky-meeting\">October 16</a> and appeared to have the desired impact. In a &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/16/trump-putin-call-zelensky-meeting\">tense</a>&#8220; meeting with Zelenskyy the following day, Trump rejected Ukrainian requests for Tomahawk missiles.</p><p>Further, in the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/witkoff-discusses-ukraine-plans-with-key-putin-aide-transcript\">leaked October 14 call</a>, Witkoff appears to suggest that he partner with Russia to create the &#8220;Trump plan&#8221; to end the war in Ukraine. &#8220;We put a 20-point Trump plan together [for Gaza] that was 20 points for peace and I&#8217;m thinking maybe we do the same thing with you,&#8221; Witkoff said. &#8220;Maybe [Putin] says to President Trump: you know, Steve and Yuri discussed a very similar 20-point plan to peace and that could be something that we think might move the needle a little bit.&#8221;</p><p>On <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/europe/peace-proposal-russia-ukraine-annotated-intl-vis\">October 20</a>, the United States produced a 28-point &#8220;Trump plan&#8221; which required Ukraine to cede significant territory to Russia, permanently abandon aspirations to join NATO, and limit the size of its army. It was less a peace plan than a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/world/europe/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan.html\">laundry list of Russian demands</a>. Indeed, Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-peace-plan-ukraine-drew-russian-document-sources-say-2025-11-26/\">reported</a> that the Trump proposal, created by Witkoff, was based on &#8220;a Russian-authored paper submitted to the Trump administration in October.&#8221; (Witkoff&#8217;s proposal has since been <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-holds-secret-meetings-russians-abu-dhabi-ukraine/story?id=127840867\">pared back</a> in an effort to attract Ukrainian support.)</p><p>All of which raises the question: Why does Witkoff appear to have so heavily favored Russia during the negotiations? The answer may be buried in Witkoff&#8217;s 33-page <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Witkoff-Steven.pdf\">financial disclosure form</a>, quietly posted to the White House website in September.</p><p>The document, known as form 278e, reveals that Witkoff has ongoing financial interests that link him to Russian oligarchs and others hostile to Ukrainian interests.</p><p>In 2021, Witkoff <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-06/troubled-manhattan-condo-project-gets-fresh-start-with-a-new-name\">partnered</a> with billionaire Len Blavatnik to take over the project now known as One High Line, a massive luxury condo development in New York City&#8217;s Chelsea neighborhood. In 2024, Witkoff and Blavatnik refinanced the development for $1.15 billion.</p><p>Blavatnik, born in Soviet Ukraine, is a naturalized U.S. and UK citizen. He made his initial fortune investing in Russia alongside <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/90-million-yacht-sanctioned-russian-oligarch-viktor-vekselberg-seized-spain-request-united\">sanctioned Russian oligarch Victor Vekselberg</a>. Among other ventures, Blavatnik and Veksberg acquired 40% of Tyumen Oil Company (TNK) for $800 million in 1997 and, in 2003, merged it with the Russian assets of BP. In 2013, Blavatnik and Veksberg sold their stake in the company, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/blavatnik-piles-into-biotech-to-build-on-38-billion-fortune\">netting Blavatnik around $7 billion</a>. Veksberg reportedly has &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/-most-clever-oligarch-severed-his-37b-fortune-from-russian-roots\">close ties</a>&#8220; to Putin.</p><p>Based on his connections to the Putin regime, Blavatnik was <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/ukrainian-president-sanctions-134-companies-51-individuals-as-war-continues/3090805\">sanctioned by Ukraine</a> in December 2023 for at least 10 years. Blavatnik claims to have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-18/billionaire-blavatnik-said-to-unload-last-major-russia-asset-with-rusal-sale\">divested</a> from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, selling a valuable stake in an aluminum business he owned with Veksberg.</p><p>Nevertheless, British politicians have <a href=\"https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2024/10/17/robert-jenrick-accepts-25000-from-ukraine-sanctioned-leonard-blavatnik\">faced criticism</a> for accepting donations from Blavatnik in light of the Ukrainian sanctions. He also established the Blavatnik Fund for Innovation at Yale, which has <a href=\"https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2022/03/15/criticism-sparks-over-russia-linked-billionaire-yale-donor/\">become controversial</a>. &#8220;As many of us have begun to learn more about Kremlin-associated oligarchs, we&#8217;re deeply uncomfortable with being affiliated with these awards,&#8221; Aaron Ring, a recipient of the award, told Yale News in 2022.</p><p>As Witkoff serves as Trump&#8217;s top negotiator to end the war in Ukraine, Blavatnik remains Witkoff&#8217;s most important business partner. The 278e form reveals that Witkoff has maintained his ownership stake in 76 Eleventh Avenue Property Owner LLC, part of his &#8220;residential real estate&#8221; holding in New York City, and a subsidiary of WG 76 11th LLC. The value of the parent LLC is listed at $50 million or more, the highest valuation category.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_uF7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F052ad31c-ba27-4c0e-bf5a-80c55329c912_2000x1214.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"884\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_uF7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F052ad31c-ba27-4c0e-bf5a-80c55329c912_2000x1214.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>76 Eleventh Avenue Property Owner LLC is the entity selling the condos at One High Line, according to a <a href=\"https://www.onehighlineresidences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/One-High-Line-Fact-Sheet-5.22.23.pdf\">public document</a> posted by the development.</p><p>Witkoff is also partnered with Blavatnik on <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/steve-witkoff-s-family-real-estate-firm-sells-200-million-in-miami-condos\">Ocean Terrace</a>, an ultra-luxury condo development in Miami. Witkoff&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Witkoff-Steven.pdf\">form</a> lists Ocean Terrace Owners LLC and related entities. While the project is still under construction, there have been <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/steve-witkoff-s-family-real-estate-firm-sells-200-million-in-miami-condos\">hundreds of millions in pre-sales</a>.</p><h3><strong>What is missing from Witkoff&#8217;s federal disclosure</strong></h3><p>One of the primary purposes of the federal disclosure form is to ensure that the filer is in compliance with the conflict of interest provisions of federal law. All forms must be reviewed by a federal ethics official within <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/2634.605\">60 days</a> of filing. The federal official then signs the form, certifying that &#8220;on the basis of information contained in this report, I conclude that the filer is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.&#8221;</p><p>But while Witkoff signed his form on August 13, the version posted to the White House website remains <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Witkoff-Steven.pdf\">unsigned</a>. This is not an oversight. On November 17, Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) sent a <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/warren_murphy_letter_to_white_house_oge_on_witkoff_financial_disclosures.pdf\">letter</a> to the White House Counsel and the Office of Government ethics noting that &#8220;no agency ethics official signed the form&#8230; even though the 60-day deadline for an ethics official to review his form passed in October 2025.&#8221; The Senators say the form &#8220;appears to have inaccurate or incomplete information.&#8221;</p><p>One issue is that Witkoff&#8217;s form does not provide full transparency about what financial assets Witkoff currently owns.</p><p>The form does reveal that Witkoff &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-14/witkoff-sold-120-million-stake-in-his-company-disclosure-shows\">sold an interest in his eponymous real estate management company for $120 million</a>&#8220; as &#8220;part of divestiture planning.&#8221; But he continues to own a portion of the Witkoff Group valued at more than $50 million, according to the same form. So he has not actually divested from the company.</p><p>Further, a partial stake in the Witkoff Group, a private real estate company, is an illiquid asset. So who did Witkoff sell his stake to? Witkoff has not disclosed the buyer. It could be a family member, such as his son Alex Witkoff, who is currently running the company. Such a sale would do little to assuage concerns about conflict.</p><h3><strong>Diplomacy or kleptocracy?</strong></h3><p>In addition to his current partnership with Blavatnik, Witkoff is ideally positioned to financially benefit from a peace deal if it includes unfreezing Russian assets. Witkoff appears to be focused on maximizing investment opportunities.</p><p>In an unusual move, Witkoff hammered out the peace plan not with a Russian foreign affairs official but with Kirill Dmitriev, the head of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqffu2kB3YBk-hgTjzhlmyQlpW0GML-2LGqueZOuh9cXC4LUx-ItNu46tiimrjs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=692cc236&amp;gaa_sig=smlwcmuJeTodqR16ZAKYz03__iSCWMi7ah-KqUx0MAak81iW2k7ZXBXpHYeuEBncCXoS3yXZU2y7kJP3vBUMMw%3D%3D\">Russia&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund</a> (RDIF). In 2022, Dmitriev was <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0612\">sanctioned by the United States</a> and banned from the country for his role at the RDIF, which the Treasury Department described as &#8220;a slush fund for President Vladimir Putin and&#8230; emblematic of Russia&#8217;s broader kleptocracy.&#8221;</p><p>Despite the sanctions, Witkoff requested Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent allow Dmitriev to travel to DC in April. Bessent <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqffu2kB3YBk-hgTjzhlmyQlpW0GML-2LGqueZOuh9cXC4LUx-ItNu46tiimrjs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=692cc236&amp;gaa_sig=smlwcmuJeTodqR16ZAKYz03__iSCWMi7ah-KqUx0MAak81iW2k7ZXBXpHYeuEBncCXoS3yXZU2y7kJP3vBUMMw%3D%3D\">reportedly</a> &#8220;had questions about the unique request, but ultimately signed off.&#8221; Since then, Witkoff and Dmitriev have met multiple times in person, in Moscow and elsewhere, and chatted frequently on the phone. Last month Witkoff and Dmitriev met in Miami to finalize the &#8220;Trump plan.&#8221;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/europe/peace-proposal-russia-ukraine-annotated-intl-vis\">28-point plan</a> specifically contemplates using Russian assets to facilitate American investment.

Your contributions go towards my considerable care needs. If you enjoy my work, please consider becoming a paid subscriber\u2014it truly makes a difference. Below, a historic review of Kama Sutra: A Guide to the Art of Pleasure Subscribe now Share \u201cW hat a pity it\u2019s not a sin!\u201d says a woman licking an ice cream in a story by Stendhal, reminding us that the search for pleasure \u2013 and prohibited pleasure at that \u2013 is a primary preoccupation for most people a good deal of the time, even for those trying to hide from it. Even reading the Kama Sutra, in a fine new translation by AND Haksar, feels like a guilty pleasure. In the mid-60s, when I first heard of it, the Kama Sutra was, along with The Perfumed Garden and Venus in Furs , considered licentious and filthy, the very gateway to damnation. In the London suburbs in the early 60s, if a young man sought knowledge of sexual matters he had to traipse up to the West End to watch European films, and if particularly desperate during a tiresome evening might even be forced to turn to literature. My father owned copies of contraband such as Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover , Lolita and other such serious stuff, along with Harold Robbins. The real business, for me, was in the Robbins, and I ended up never reading the Kama Sutra. And the longer I didn\u2019t read it, the more dreadful this famed carnival of desire and mayhem became in my imagination. It turns out that Kama Sutra: A Guide to the Art of Pleasure is a compendium of advice about social and romantic behaviour, put together 1,600 years ago, for wealthy young men about town. It contains information about hygiene and sexual positions, and advises how not to cause havoc in a harem, how to deal with courtesans and how to behave towards \u201cthe wives of others\u201d. It suggests that the gentleman should keep away from lepers, malodorous women and anyone with white spots. It is arch, comical and amazing \u2013 less Byron and more the sort of thing that Jeeves would have said to a priapic Bertie Wooster had Bertie been Indian and PG Wodehouse without the sense to omit sex from his books. It states, for example, that \u201cintercourse with two women who have good feelings for each other is known as the \u2018combination\u2019. The same with many women is called \u2018the herd of cows\u2019.\u201d Although the Kama Sutra doesn\u2019t take pleasure seriously enough to be wise, it is certainly a reminder of the central place of sexuality and its pleasures in our lives, and pleasures, as every parent knows, have to be both limited and passed on to the next generation. They are, then, mostly transmitted by being forbidden, and it is this relation to prohibition that amuses and intrigues Stendhal. It is prohibition that makes serious recreation feasible, just as it is the rules that make sport possible. Without authorities or taboos there isn\u2019t more fun, but more nothing, particularly as we tend to treat ourselves more severely than even the authorities do. The Kama Sutra, as a book of technique \u2013 a sexual self-help manual for the socially naive, a way for geeks to make it with girls \u2013 is fascinating, therefore, in what it omits. It neglects, for instance, one of the most important parts of love: that one can caress with the voice as well as with the eyes. In fact, its routines appear to render any form of sensual transaction uncreative, predictable and controlled, and the male omnipotent. If it turned out that the woman was also consulting a similar manual then the two characters in this drama would be playing roles that would ensure they\u2019d remain outside the experience. Both would be in a fixed place and the relationship would merely be an exchange of fantasies.

In the mid-60s, when I first heard of it, the Kama Sutra was, along with <em>The Perfumed Garden</em> and <em>Venus in Furs</em>, considered licentious and filthy, the very gateway to damnation. In the London suburbs in the early 60s, if a young man sought knowledge of sexual matters he had to traipse up to the West End to watch European films, and if particularly desperate during a tiresome evening might even be forced to turn to literature. My father owned copies of contraband such as <em>Lady Chatterley&#8217;s Lover</em>, <em>Lolita</em> and other such serious stuff, along with Harold Robbins. The real business, for me, was in the Robbins, and I ended up never reading the Kama Sutra. And the longer I didn&#8217;t read it, the more dreadful this famed carnival of desire and mayhem became in my imagination.</p><p>It turns out that <em>Kama Sutra: A Guide to the Art of Pleasure</em> is a compendium of advice about social and romantic behaviour, put together 1,600 years ago, for wealthy young men about town. It contains information about hygiene and sexual positions, and advises how not to cause havoc in a harem, how to deal with courtesans and how to behave towards &#8220;the wives of others&#8221;. It suggests that the gentleman should keep away from lepers, malodorous women and anyone with white spots. It is arch, comical and amazing &#8211; less Byron and more the sort of thing that Jeeves would have said to a priapic Bertie Wooster had Bertie been Indian and PG Wodehouse without the sense to omit sex from his books. It states, for example, that &#8220;intercourse with two women who have good feelings for each other is known as the &#8216;combination&#8217;. The same with many women is called &#8216;the herd of cows&#8217;.&#8221; Although the Kama Sutra doesn&#8217;t take pleasure seriously enough to be wise, it is certainly a reminder of the central place of sexuality and its pleasures in our lives, and pleasures, as every parent knows, have to be both limited and passed on to the next generation. They are, then, mostly transmitted by being forbidden, and it is this relation to prohibition that amuses and intrigues Stendhal. It is prohibition that makes serious recreation feasible, just as it is the rules that make sport possible. Without authorities or taboos there isn&#8217;t more fun, but more nothing, particularly as we tend to treat ourselves more severely than even the authorities do.</p><p>The Kama Sutra, as a book of technique &#8211; a sexual self-help manual for the socially naive, a way for geeks to make it with girls &#8211; is fascinating, therefore, in what it omits. It neglects, for instance, one of the most important parts of love: that one can caress with the voice as well as with the eyes.</p><p>In fact, its routines appear to render any form of sensual transaction uncreative, predictable and controlled, and the male omnipotent. If it turned out that the woman was also consulting a similar manual then the two characters in this drama would be playing roles that would ensure they&#8217;d remain outside the experience. Both would be in a fixed place and the relationship would merely be an exchange of fantasies. The interesting question here is whether this is perhaps the truth about sex &#8211; whether a Clintonesque &#8220;I did not have sexual relations&#8221; seems to get it right, and there is really no touching, ever &#8211; or if this is wishful thinking.

My biggest moments of satisfaction didn\u2019t come from easy or cozy experiences. Instead, they came from discomfort. Discomfort, as it turns out, isn\u2019t the enemy. It can be a gateway to purpose. Here\u2019s how I make that happen: when things get tough, I lean into my values. These are my current values: Discipline \u2013 Showing up, even when it\u2019s hard. Movement \u2013 Stepping away from screens and experiencing life in atoms, not bits. Kindness \u2013 To treat living beings with dignity and care. In particular, to embrace opportunities to serve. Courage \u2013 Facing what feels impossible with grit and heart. here\u2019s one I prepared earlier Recently my apartment building had a bunch of hairy problems to sort through. I\u2019m on the owner\u2019s committee. It\u2019s a volunteer position. And people often complain about how slow things happen. I find it easy to slide into resentment. I sometimes perceive a lack of gratitude from the entitled demands of our voluntary labour. After my annual reflection, I started rethinking these resentments. By bringing my values to these tricky situations, they felt more purposeful. For example, I started bringing discipline from other areas to the stream of requests. The calendar invites became opportunities to for connection, kindness and service. Finally, having tough conversations became a training ground for courage. reflection makes it easier But here\u2019s the thing: I wouldn\u2019t know these values if I didn\u2019t take time to reflect. Reflection helps me connect the dots between discomfort and meaning. Without it, I\u2019d be spinning my wheels, and mistaking busywork for real progress. If you\u2019re not sure where to start, try this: Think about the past week. What energized you? What drained your energy? Can you bring more energizing things into your life? Can you remove or reduce the draining things? Can you think differently about some of the draining things? For example: Connect them to a deeper \u201cwhy\u201d or reason. Remember the \u201cnecessity\u201d behind the \u201cnecessary evil.\u201d If you\u2019re struggling to remember what happened during your week, you might want to try these steps daily. With regular practice, a deeper understanding of your values will likely emerge. Instead of starting from scratch, it\u2019ll feel more like connecting the dots.

Describing the venerable parchment in terms that few politicians would dare employ, the essay\u2019s title offered a punchy summation: The problem was \u201cOur Broken Constitution.\u201d As Osita Nwanevu notes in his new book, The Right of the People, Americans have been trying to tell pollsters that something is broken for the last 25 years. In a remarkable shift from the optimism that opened this century, when nearly three-quarters of the country expressed satisfaction with the direction of American life, large majorities have now come to disapprove of the way things are going in the United States. What\u2019s more, they predict that by midcentury their country will be less prosperous, less powerful, more divided, and more unequal. This protracted national pessimism suggests that something is broken, but is it the Constitution? The question is trickier than it may appear on first glance, for the brokenness of something like a constitution is not a simple thing to determine. The familiar adage holds: If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. There\u2019s no question that something needs to be done if the sink won\u2019t drain or the car won\u2019t start, but if we\u2019re trying to determine whether a constitution is \u201cbroken,\u201d we first need to explain what it is that \u201cwe\u201d expect it to do when it\u2019s \u201cworking.\u201d In fact, things are even more complicated than that, since it\u2019s far from a straightforward matter to say exactly what a constitution is: Is it the text alone? Its underlying values? The contexts, norms, and precedents that are attached to it? (Finally, whose job is it to interpret these things?) The U.S. Constitution contains a preamble that announces what the document is supposed to do: to \u201cform a more perfect Union,\u201d \u201cestablish Justice,\u201d \u201cpromote the general Welfare,\u201d and so on. But in general, this list of constitutional purposes has been seen as offering general interpretive guidance, rather than as establishing specific legal powers. As a result, it can be difficult to ascertain whether broad constitutional purposes are being frustrated: Whether the government is working to \u201csecure the Blessings of Liberty\u201d is a more abstract matter than, say, whether a state passing legislation in defiance of a treaty violates the Supremacy Clause. And that\u2019s before we even consider intractable disagreements about such questions as how to define the general welfare, or whose vision of justice we are establishing. Perhaps, as many thinkers have maintained, we shouldn\u2019t want a constitution to hew to any especially thick understanding of these goals. Instead, realizing that agreement on such matters will always be elusive in a diverse and free society, we should simply aspire to a basic law that peacefully channels political competition and adheres to broadly fair, neutral procedures\u2014a system that rival groups can agree to, since none of them want to face the state-backed interference of the others. And as historians and political scientists will point out, a written constitution like ours\u2014which has been substantially amended over the last two and a half centuries\u2014is a polyvocal document. It inevitably reflects the colliding perspectives and interests of many groups of people from many different eras, all of whom achieved constitutional change by settling for compromises that did not reflect their exact wishes. \u201cAmerica is not, in fact, a democracy,\u201d Nwanevu writes. \u201cIt was not founded as one.\u201d For his part, Nwanevu, a contributing editor at The New Republic , thinks the Constitution expresses a fairly unified perspective, that it hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed since its inception, and that it is working more or less as designed. Nwanevu, whose journalism broadly covers American politics and public policy, canvasses in this book many commonly critiqued features of the American political system: the various factors that frustrate the legislative process and limit its responsiveness (gerrymandering and oversized single-member districts in the House, the filibuster in the Senate, etc.); the every-state-gets-two design of the Senate; the Electoral College; the growing powers of the presidency; the influence of money; and so on. But while he decries these problems, he doesn\u2019t regard them as evidence that Americans have betrayed the Framers\u2019 noble constitutional vision, or as proof that the text has been broken by unwise laws, scheming politicians, imperious judges, or a decadent citizenry. The deeper issue, he contends, is that the Constitution isn\u2019t broken; it works all too well. \u201cAmerica is not, in fact, a democracy,\u201d Nwanevu writes. \u201cIt was not founded as one.\u201d The designers of the American political system, he argues, were elites appalled by the economic and political turbulence that marked the brief lifespan of the Articles of Confederation. For them, \u201cthe worst of those crises was an \u2018excess of democracy\u2019 in the states,\u201d which had fueled a push for \u201cpopulist policies\u201d\u2014such as paper money and debt and tax relief\u2014\u201cthat most wealthy Americans found dangerous and destructive.\u201d While the system has changed in significant ways since the eighteenth century, Nwanevu contends that \u201cthe basic foundation they laid down remains remarkably strong\u2014to our detriment. We find our political system frustrating largely because it was designed to frustrate us. Many Americans have come to suspect our institutions do more to protect the wealthy than they do to represent ordinary people. This is precisely what the Founders wanted and what the Constitution was written to achieve.\u201d I f it is a mistake to describe the American system as a democracy, it not only follows that widespread calls to \u201cprotect\u201d or \u201csave\u201d democracy are inapt. It also becomes easier to explain why Americans have responded to these exhortations with less enthusiasm than one might predict in a society whose political style has long been distinguished by constitutional veneration. The argument goes something like this: Americans broadly revere their Constitution because they believe it establishes and protects a democratic way of life, but they don\u2019t experience politics that way. Instead, they feel alienated and disempowered, able to perceive that despite all the rhetoric, the people are not really in charge. Yet because they don\u2019t appreciate that the Constitution generally frustrates (instead of enabling) democratic self-rule, they are more likely to see what they call democracy as \u201ca specious and suspicious platitude,\u201d as Nwanevu writes\u2014reducing it to the emaciated form of self-rule they experience, instead of seeing it as a means of empowerment their system has denied them. For such people, democracy is a consistent disappointment, not worth the effort to rescue or defend. Nwanevu\u2019s book suggests that this would be a terribly mistaken conclusion, for it is not democracy that has failed Americans, but rather their \u201cundemocratic Constitution\u201d (as the legal scholar Sanford Levinson has labeled it). As Nwanevu writes in the introduction, the book advances three basic arguments: that democracy is good; that the United States is not a democracy; and that it should become one through both political and economic transformations. In other words, we should do what the founders did 250 years ago, with \u201cexactly their sense of purpose and even higher, more righteous ambitions for America than they themselves had.\u201d This way of putting it might strike some readers\u2014those inclined to revere the founders as an unusually wise and public-spirited group of political leaders\u2014as insufficiently appreciative. But as Nwanevu notes, we take the founders (or at least some of them) seriously when we task ourselves with the job of revising, or even completely remaking, the political institutions they bequeathed to us. Many of the most important figures of the founding era, especially those most immersed in Enlightenment philosophy, believed that political institutions could only be legitimate if they rested on consent\u2014and that this ideal of legitimacy would raise tough questions as time went on, since successive generations would find themselves under the authority of a government crafted by people long since dead. If the circumstances of the world remained forever the same, and if knowledge and opinions never progressed, living under the laws of the past might be an inconvenient but ultimately tolerable state of affairs. But as Thomas Paine argued in his 1791 work Rights of Man : The circumstances of the world are continually changing, and the opinions of men change also; and as government is for the living, and not for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it. That which may be thought right and found convenient in one age may be thought wrong and found inconvenient in another. In such cases, who is to decide, the living or the dead? In the same text, Paine speculated that a sufficiently dynamic political system furnished a solution to this problem: It requires but a very small glance of thought to perceive that although laws made in one generation often continue in force through succeeding generations, yet they continue to derive their force from the consent of the living. A law not repealed continues in force, not because it cannot be repealed, but because it is not repealed; and the non-repealing passes for consent. In other words, the dead hand of the past is not necessarily oppressive, so long as we can cast it off whenever we choose\u2014and if we choose not to, our consent can be inferred from that choice not to act. Thomas Jefferson, reflecting on the same problem as Paine\u2014\u201c[w]hether one generation of men has a right to bind another\u201d\u2014suggested in a 1789 letter to James Madison that every constitution \u201cnaturally expires\u201d after 19 years. Notably, during the drafting of the Constitution in the summer of 1787, Jefferson had been in Paris, while Madison had been leading painstaking negotiations in the stuffy, overheated atmosphere of Independence Hall, with the windows shuttered to ensure privacy. Unsurprisingly, Madison\u2019s response to his friend was gracious but unmoved: \u201cMy first thoughts though coinciding with many of yours, lead me to view the doctrine as not in all respects compatible with the course of human affairs.\u201d As things have turned out, we have neither a Constitution that resets every 19 years, nor one so easily changeable as to justify the conclusion that Americans have lent their consent to the totality of the document. Our Constitution, notes Nwanevu, is \u201cthe hardest in the world to amend as a practical matter\u201d; moreover, he argues, \u201cas a matter of democratic principle, the amendment process is simply abominable.\u201d (As the legal scholar Jedediah Purdy has observed, the ratification process requires that three-quarters of the states approve an amendment, and since so many states have relatively small populations, it would be possible for just 13 of them\u2014collectively containing less than 10 percent of the country\u2019s people\u2014to quash even a mega-popular amendment.) We should honor the founders, Nwanevu concludes, by doing what they did: relying on our own present-day ingenuity, rather than their wisdom, to replace the system they devised with something better. This is not going to be quick work. Because he worries that a new Article V constitutional convention would be hijacked by anti-democratic interests, Nwanevu predicts that it will take \u201cdecades of political persuasion and organization\u201d before a new system is ready to launch: \u201cWe are still perhaps generations away from a truly democratic Constitution.\u201d M uch of the way Nwanevu builds his case will be familiar to at least some readers. There is more than a hint, for example, of the (uncited) Progressive Era historian Charles Beard in the way the book traces the Constitution\u2019s provisions to the economic interests of the founders. (Michael Klarman, who has influentially updated Beard\u2019s long-controversial thesis in recent years, is cited extensively.) Similarly, the book\u2019s discussion of the Constitution\u2019s democratic deficit is reminiscent of Robert Dahl\u2019s now-classic How Democratic Is the American Constitution? Its overview of contemporary debates over the desirability and efficacy of democracy (in theory and in practice) canvasses, among other prominent works, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels\u2019s influential 2016 book Democracy for Realists , the anti-democratic arguments of the philosopher Jason Brennan, and the pro-democracy alternatives defended by theorists such as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore. If you\u2019re broadly familiar with these works, you will notice how capably the book traverses an array of academic literatures, skillfully synthesizing from history, political science, and philosophy in support of its core claims. If you\u2019re not familiar with these works, the book offers an excellent introduction to many important contemporary debates among diverse scholars of democracy, especially American democracy. It\u2019s worth emphasizing how relatively uncommon it is for books aimed at a general readership to attempt this ambitious synthesis of so many topics and approaches. After a few opening pages that recount the widespread democracy-talk that has come to dominate political discussion in recent years, Nwanevu candidly declares that he wrote his own contribution to this discourse \u201cout of boredom\u201d\u2014because he was \u201cdog-tired\u201d of \u201cthe habits of mind that shape American political journalism\u201d and \u201cwearied\u201d by its failure to \u201cmeet this political moment.\u201d Liberated from the breakneck pace and merciless, click-based economics of that medium, he takes full advantage of a book\u2019s length: starting with a discussion of democracy\u2019s history and its core values, moving into an overview of its critics, cataloguing its different varieties, guiding the reader through critical ratification-era debates, and concluding with proposals for a range of practical reforms. It may be the people\u2019s gnawing recognition of their impotence that encourages their recklessness. While the argument is more reliant on historical narrative and academic scholarship than on revealing anecdotes, it is by no means excessively abstract or lacking in detail. For example, Nwanevu begins his defense of \u201ceconomic democracy\u201d by reviewing the philosophical arguments for taking the power of (for example) employers and managers as seriously as we take the power of politicians. He then concretizes that idea by spelling out exactly what it means in practice: the revival of organized labor, the implementation of sectoral bargaining, and policies that would promote a role for workers in ownership and corporate governance. Such reforms usually receive only a fraction of the attention given to the more familiar political reforms that the book endorses (such as abolishing the Electoral College, ending the filibuster, strengthening campaign finance law, and making it easier to vote). But Nwanevu makes the forceful case that economic democracy shouldn\u2019t be seen as a separate or unrelated matter. Not only would such policies materially benefit many Americans, but they would also turn the workplaces where we spend most of our time into training sites for democratic citizenship: Democracy, as should be plain by now, is a vastly complicated thing; like all complicated things, engaging in it well takes practice. Habits and skills such as learning how to present and debate one\u2019s ideas, when and how to compromise, and how to critically assess and synthesize different sources of information before coming to a decision are critical for democratic life\u2026. Economic democracy\u2014whether through participating in unions, electing work councils, voting as shareholding workers, or working in full-fledged cooperatives\u2014gives us the opportunity to hone those skills at work, where we come together with people often very different from ourselves to achieve things big and small. Among the many objections this book may provoke is the familiar claim\u2014as old as democracy itself\u2014that ordinary people can\u2019t be trusted with the sort of power Nwanevu wants for them. They simply aren\u2019t responsible. But there are two distinct yet interrelated senses in which it might be said that the people \u201caren\u2019t responsible.\u201d They might lack responsibility in the sense of being irresponsible \u2014that is, exercising power in ways that are impulsive, ignorant, selfish, reckless, and so on. But the people might also lack responsibility in the sense that they really do not, in the end, determine the course of events in their shared political life; as a practical matter, responsibility lies with some other person or entity entrusted with greater power. Again, these two deficits of responsibility are related, for it may be the people\u2019s gnawing recognition of their impotence that encourages their recklessness: We can be careless with our body politic, the people might quietly suspect, because in the end it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014someone else is calling the shots. They may be as likely to undermine our wise choices as they are to bail us out of our foolish ones. So those who aim to keep political power away from the dissolute masses might have it backward: Instead of their supposed irresponsibility being a reason to deny them power, it may be that denying them power is a key reason for their irresponsibility. If the people\u2019s fate were genuinely, palpably, terrifyingly in their own hands, they might behave more responsibly. Or at least that\u2019s one way of understanding the wager posed by the ideal of democratic self-rule. Can even the disaffected and alienated among us dismiss that as a mere platitude?",

A law not repealed continues in force, not because it cannot be repealed, but because it is not repealed; and the non-repealing passes for consent.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the dead hand of the past is not necessarily oppressive, so long as we can cast it off whenever we choose\u2014and if we choose not to, our consent can be inferred from that choice not to act. Thomas Jefferson, reflecting on the same problem as Paine\u2014\u201c[w]hether one generation of men has a right to bind another\u201d\u2014suggested in a 1789 letter to James Madison that every constitution \u201cnaturally expires\u201d after 19 years. Notably, during the drafting of the Constitution in the summer of 1787, Jefferson had been in Paris, while Madison had been leading painstaking negotiations in the stuffy, overheated atmosphere of Independence Hall, with the windows shuttered to ensure privacy. Unsurprisingly, Madison\u2019s response to his friend was gracious but unmoved: \u201cMy first thoughts though coinciding with many of yours, lead me to view the doctrine as not in <em>all</em> respects compatible with the course of human affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>As things have turned out, we have neither a Constitution that resets every 19 years, nor one so easily changeable as to justify the conclusion that Americans have lent their consent to the totality of the document. Our Constitution, notes Nwanevu, is \u201cthe hardest in the world to amend as a practical matter\u201d; moreover, he argues, \u201cas a matter of democratic principle, the amendment process is simply abominable.\u201d (As the legal scholar Jedediah Purdy has observed, the ratification process requires that three-quarters of the states approve an amendment, and since so many states have relatively small populations, it would be possible for just 13 of them\u2014collectively containing less than 10 percent of the country\u2019s people\u2014to quash even a mega-popular amendment.) We should honor the founders, Nwanevu concludes, by doing what they did: relying on our own present-day ingenuity, rather than their wisdom, to replace the system they devised with something better. This is not going to be quick work. Because he worries that a new Article V constitutional convention would be hijacked by anti-democratic interests, Nwanevu predicts that it will take \u201cdecades of political persuasion and organization\u201d before a new system is ready to launch: \u201cWe are still perhaps generations away from a truly democratic Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p><span class=\"initial\">M</span>uch of the way Nwanevu builds his case will be familiar to at least some readers. There is more than a hint, for example, of the (uncited) Progressive Era historian Charles Beard in the way the book traces the Constitution\u2019s provisions to the economic interests of the founders. (Michael Klarman, who has influentially updated Beard\u2019s long-controversial thesis in recent years, is cited extensively.) Similarly, the book\u2019s discussion of the Constitution\u2019s democratic deficit is reminiscent of Robert Dahl\u2019s now-classic <em>How Democratic Is the American Constitution?</em> Its overview of contemporary debates over the desirability and efficacy of democracy (in theory and in practice) canvasses, among other prominent works, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels\u2019s influential 2016 book <em>Democracy for Realists</em>, the anti-democratic arguments of the philosopher Jason Brennan, and the pro-democracy alternatives defended by theorists such as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore. If you\u2019re broadly familiar with these works, you will notice how capably the book traverses an array of academic literatures, skillfully synthesizing from history, political science, and philosophy in support of its core claims. If you\u2019re not familiar with these works, the book offers an excellent introduction to many important contemporary debates among diverse scholars of democracy, especially American democracy.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth emphasizing how relatively uncommon it is for books aimed at a general readership to attempt this ambitious synthesis of so many topics and approaches. After a few opening pages that recount the widespread democracy-talk that has come to dominate political discussion in recent years, Nwanevu candidly declares that he wrote his own contribution to this discourse \u201cout of boredom\u201d\u2014because he was \u201cdog-tired\u201d of \u201cthe habits of mind that shape American political journalism\u201d and \u201cwearied\u201d by its failure to \u201cmeet this political moment.\u201d Liberated from the breakneck pace and merciless, click-based economics of that medium, he takes full advantage of a book\u2019s length: starting with a discussion of democracy\u2019s history and its core values, moving into an overview of its critics, cataloguing its different varieties, guiding the reader through critical ratification-era debates, and concluding with proposals for a range of practical reforms.</p>\n<div class=\"pull-left\">It may be the people\u2019s gnawing recognition of their impotence that encourages their recklessness.</div>\n<p>While the argument is more reliant on historical narrative and academic scholarship than on revealing anecdotes, it is by no means excessively abstract or lacking in detail. For example, Nwanevu begins his defense of \u201ceconomic democracy\u201d by reviewing the philosophical arguments for taking the power of (for example) employers and managers as seriously as we take the power of politicians. He then concretizes that idea by spelling out exactly what it means in practice: the revival of organized labor, the implementation of sectoral bargaining, and policies that would promote a role for workers in ownership and corporate governance. Such reforms usually receive only a fraction of the attention given to the more familiar political reforms that the book endorses (such as abolishing the Electoral College, ending the filibuster, strengthening campaign finance law, and making it easier to vote).</p>\n<p>But Nwanevu makes the forceful case that economic democracy shouldn\u2019t be seen as a separate or unrelated matter. Not only would such policies materially benefit many Americans, but they would also turn the workplaces where we spend most of our time into training sites for democratic citizenship:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Democracy, as should be plain by now, is a vastly complicated thing; like all complicated things, engaging in it well takes practice. Habits and skills such as learning how to present and debate one\u2019s ideas, when and how to compromise, and how to critically assess and synthesize different sources of information before coming to a decision are critical for democratic life\u2026. Economic democracy\u2014whether through participating in unions, electing work councils, voting as shareholding workers, or working in full-fledged cooperatives\u2014gives us the opportunity to hone those skills at work, where we come together with people often very different from ourselves to achieve things big and small.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Among the many objections this book may provoke is the familiar claim\u2014as old as democracy itself\u2014that ordinary people can\u2019t be trusted with the sort of power Nwanevu wants for them. They simply aren\u2019t responsible. But there are two distinct yet interrelated senses in which it might be said that the people \u201caren\u2019t responsible.\u201d They might lack responsibility in the sense of being <em>irresponsible</em>\u2014that is, exercising power in ways that are impulsive, ignorant, selfish, reckless, and so on. But the people might also lack responsibility in the sense that they really do not, in the end, determine the course of events in their shared political life; as a practical matter, responsibility lies with some other person or entity entrusted with greater power. Again, these two deficits of responsibility are related, for it may be the people\u2019s gnawing recognition of their impotence that encourages their recklessness: We can be careless with our body politic, the people might quietly suspect, because in the end it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014someone else is calling the shots. They may be as likely to undermine our wise choices as they are to bail us out of our foolish ones.</p>\n<p>So those who aim to keep political power away from the dissolute masses might have it backward: Instead of their supposed irresponsibility being a reason to deny them power, it may be that denying them power is a key reason for their irresponsibility. If the people\u2019s fate were genuinely, palpably, terrifyingly in their own hands, they might behave more responsibly. Or at least that\u2019s one way of understanding the wager posed by the ideal of democratic self-rule. Can even the disaffected and alienated among us dismiss that as a mere platitude?</p>"

Since the launch of the DHS operation \u201cMidway Blitz\u201d in Chicago only weeks ago, Shootings are down 35%, Robberies are down 41%, and Carjackings are down almost 50%.\u201d Part of the challenge with evaluating this statement is that there\u2019s no specified comparison period. There is some intense seasonality to crime in Chicago as clearly seen by this Real-Time Crime Index graph of monthly violent crime in Chicago. Chicago crime in September, October, and November is going to be lower than crime in June, July, and August. Let\u2019s assume the President is comparing citywide crime this year to last year for an apples-to-apples comparison. Using the city\u2019s excellent Violence Reduction Dashboard does indeed show impressive drops in nearly every category of violent crime in Chicago. This Week On The Jeff-alytics Podcast New this week to the podcast: I talk with gun violence researcher and NIBRS expert Susan Parker. We try to answer every question you\u2019ve ever had about NIBRS \u2014 what is it, how does it differ from the old system, and how will new changes impact what can be analyzed. Check it out: Spotify , Apple , Amazon , iHeart . Last week , I talked with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner about how his office is revolutionizing how prosecutors can use data to communicate their story. Now, back to Chicago. The President's tweet accurately characterizes the change in Chicago crime this year vs last. Shooting victimizations in Chicago are down 36 percent, robberies are down 34 percent, carjackings are down 49 percent, and overall violent victimizations are down 23 percent this year through November 12th (when I started putting all of this together) compared to the same timeframe in 2024. The city\u2019s dashboard also makes it easy to compare the YTD percent change for various different periods. Yes, murder and violent crime are down a lot in Chicago, but they were down a lot prior to the intervention and stayed down a similar amount during. This can be clearly seen by comparing the overall YTD percent change this year to the YTD percent change before (through the end of August) and the YTD percent change for the period covering the Federal intervention (September through mid-November). There\u2019s very little difference between the before and after periods suggesting the intervention itself had little impact on the topline figures. Robberies and overall violent crime fell slightly faster during the 2ish months of the intervention, but not remarkably so and reflected a continuation of a trend that started in mid-2024. Gun violence in Chicago continued more or less on the same trend after the intervention as shown in the below graphs. The top graph measures the percent change over 30 days relative to the same timeframe a year prior while the bottom graph measures the number of shooting victims rolling over 30 days. Yes, gun violence fell in September and October relative to earlier in the summer, but it always falls in September and October. Shootings were down around 35 percent in October 2025 relative to October 2024, but they were down more than 50 percent in June 2025 compared to June 2024. The lack of change in Chicago shootings stands in contrast to what I found in DC and Memphis . In those cities, shootings were the one area that may have been impacted (at least in the short term) by the Federal interventions though in DC at least that drop appears to have been relatively short lived. Finally, an analysis of Chicago\u2019s short-term crime trends must contend with the fact that reporting to 911 appears to have dropped in Chicago in the wake of the intervention. Murder and shootings likely got reported at nearly universal rates following the intervention, but a subtle change in reporting practices could very easily contribute to some decline in certain crime types. Only about 60 percent of robberies were reported to the police between 2022 and 2024 according to the National Crime Victimization Survey . The share of other crimes like theft being reported are even lower. There\u2019s evidence of falling 911 calls in Chicago in September and October 2025 \u2014 especially in Hispanic areas. The Chicago Tribune wrote a piece in early November looking at 911 calls in Chicago using data from the city\u2019s Inspector General and found a precipitous drop in September and October. The drop was especially sharp in Hispanic neighborhoods, per the Tribune. I took a look at the IG\u2019s dashboard and there\u2019s a definite drop in 911 calls citywide that appears to have been even larger in heavily Hispanic areas. The number of 911 calls dropped in every Chicago ward in September and October 2025 compared to a year ago, but they generally dropped more in wards with heavier Hispanic populations. The change in 911 calls is especially pronounced in places such as Wards 14 , 15 , and 22 (84, 70 and 89 percent Hispanic respectively). 911 calls were down 5.3 percent citywide in the first 8 months of 2025 and a similar 6.1 percent in those three wards. Calls dropped 15.4 percent in September and October citywide and were down 23 percent in Wards 14, 15 and 22. Ward 22, the most heavily Hispanic ward in the city, had a 28 percent drop in 911 calls in September and October 2025 compared to 2024. It should be noted that most of these 911 calls are not for serious criminal offenses. Nearly half of 911 dispatches this year fit in just five non-criminal categories: disturbances, parking violations, wellbeing checks, auto accidents, and burglar alarms, so dropping 911 calls is probably not a sign of dropping crime. But people who are less willing to call for police after a traffic accident are probably less likely to call police after their car was broken into. This doesn\u2019t mean that crime reporting was inherently suppressed in the wake of the Federal intervention, but it certainly does point to changes in reporting patterns as possibly being a contributing factor. That said, the change in 911 reporting is unlikely to impact shooting/murder counts, and I didn\u2019t see any obvious discrepancies in crimes being reporting in more vs less Hispanic police districts. Ultimately, what we can say is that Chicago crime was falling prior to Midway Blitz and it\u2019s falling at roughly the same rate after. Gun violence remains a serious issue in Chicago, though there\u2019s little evidence that the encouraging downward trend has changed all that much. The drop in 911 calls, however, is potentially a concerning sign of harm done to community trust. Thanks for reading Jeff-alytics! This post is public so feel free to share it.

This can be clearly seen by comparing the overall YTD percent change this year to the YTD percent change before (through the end of August) and the YTD percent change for the period covering the Federal intervention (September through mid-November). </p><div class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" id=\"datawrapper-iframe\"></div><p>There&#8217;s very little difference between the before and after periods suggesting the intervention itself had little impact on the topline figures. Robberies and overall violent crime fell slightly faster during the 2ish months of the intervention, but not remarkably so and reflected a continuation of a trend that started in mid-2024. </p><div class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" id=\"datawrapper-iframe\"></div><p>Gun violence in Chicago continued more or less on the same trend after the intervention as shown in the below graphs. The top graph measures the percent change over 30 days relative to the same timeframe a year prior while the bottom graph measures the number of shooting victims rolling over 30 days. </p><div class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" id=\"datawrapper-iframe\"></div><p>Yes, gun violence fell in September and October relative to earlier in the summer, but it always falls in September and October. Shootings were down around 35 percent in October 2025 relative to October 2024, but they were down more than 50 percent in June 2025 compared to June 2024.</p><p>The lack of change in Chicago shootings stands in contrast to what I found in <a href=\"https://jasher.substack.com/p/re-evaluating-washington-dcs-crime\">DC</a> and <a href=\"https://jasher.substack.com/p/walking-in-memphis-crime-data\">Memphis</a>. In those cities, shootings were the one area that may have been impacted (at least in the short term) by the Federal interventions though in DC at least that drop appears to have been relatively short lived. </p><p>Finally, an analysis of Chicago&#8217;s short-term crime trends must contend with the fact that reporting to 911 appears to have dropped in Chicago in the wake of the intervention. Murder and shootings likely got reported at nearly universal rates following the intervention, but a subtle change in reporting practices could very easily contribute to some decline in certain crime types. </p><p>Only about 60 percent of robberies were reported to the police between 2022 and 2024 according to the <a href=\"https://ncvs.bjs.ojp.gov/multi-year-trends/crimeType\">National Crime Victimization Survey</a>. The share of other crimes like theft being reported are even lower. </p><p>There&#8217;s evidence of falling 911 calls in Chicago in September and October 2025 &#8212; especially in Hispanic areas. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/03/911-calls-midway-blitz-little-village/?clearUserState=true\">The Chicago Tribune</a> wrote a piece in early November looking at <a href=\"https://igchicago.org/information-portal/data-dashboards/911-calls-for-cpd-service/\">911 calls</a> in Chicago using data from the city&#8217;s Inspector General and found a precipitous drop in September and October. The drop was especially sharp in Hispanic neighborhoods, per the Tribune.</p><p>I took a look at the IG&#8217;s dashboard and there&#8217;s a definite drop in 911 calls citywide that appears to have been even larger in heavily Hispanic areas. The number of 911 calls dropped in every Chicago ward in September and October 2025 compared to a year ago, but they generally dropped more in wards with heavier Hispanic populations. </p><div class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" id=\"datawrapper-iframe\"></div><p>The change in 911 calls is especially pronounced in places such as Wards <a href=\"https://chirecoveryplan.com/geography/ward-14/\">14</a>, <a href=\"https://chirecoveryplan.com/geography/ward-15/\">15</a>, and <a href=\"https://chirecoveryplan.com/geography/ward-22/\">22</a> (84, 70 and 89 percent Hispanic respectively). 911 calls were down 5.3 percent citywide in the first 8 months of 2025 and a similar 6.1 percent in those three wards. Calls dropped 15.4 percent in September and October citywide and were down 23 percent in Wards 14, 15 and 22. Ward 22, the most heavily Hispanic ward in the city, had a 28 percent drop in 911 calls in September and October 2025 compared to 2024. </p><div class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" id=\"datawrapper-iframe\"></div><p>It should be noted that most of these 911 calls are not for serious criminal offenses. Nearly half of 911 dispatches this year fit in just five non-criminal categories: disturbances, parking violations, wellbeing checks, auto accidents, and burglar alarms, so dropping 911 calls is probably not a sign of dropping crime. But people who are less willing to call for police after a traffic accident are probably less likely to call police after their car was broken into. </p><p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that crime reporting was inherently suppressed in the wake of the Federal intervention, but it certainly does point to changes in reporting patterns as possibly being a contributing factor. That said, the change in 911 reporting is unlikely to impact shooting/murder counts, and I didn&#8217;t see any obvious discrepancies in crimes being reporting in more vs less Hispanic police districts. </p><p>Ultimately, what we can say is that Chicago crime was falling prior to Midway Blitz and it&#8217;s falling at roughly the same rate after. Gun violence remains a serious issue in Chicago, though there&#8217;s little evidence that the encouraging downward trend has changed all that much. The drop in 911 calls, however, is potentially a concerning sign of harm done to community trust. </p><div class=\"captioned-button-wrap\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading Jeff-alytics!

We are, he suggests, obsessed with the idea of civilizational collapse. We are, however, in sharp disagreement about the source and mechanism of this coming collapse. If you look closely at the rich world today \u2014 at the fault lines that define every policy debate, every media outrage cycle, and every culture war skirmish \u2014 it becomes clear that we aren\u2019t grappling with one shared existential crisis. Instead, the political landscape is structured around two distinct and mutually antagonistic long-term collapse narratives. One way to characterize the division between the Left and the Right in the West is as a disagreement over which doom is real, and consequently, which doom we must fight. These two poles of existential anxiety can be summarized simply: the Left is defined by the narrative of Metabolic Collapse , and the Right is defined by the narrative of Demographic Collapse. To accept the other side\u2019s crisis is, by definition, to reject the political solutions and power structures you are currently championing, and vice versa. And these are existential threat narratives \u2014 e.g. narratives that see the other side as trying to literally eliminate you and yours, an idea that is at the core of most every genocidal campaign in history. The Left\u2019s Doom: The Metabolic Threat The first, and most globally recognized, narrative of existential risk centers on the destruction of the planetary systems that sustain human life. This is the Metabolic Threat, and it is a dominant narrative engine of the contemporary political Left. This doom argues that the capitalist, industrial structure of modern civilization has irrevocably breached the ecological limits of the planet. The focus is on the long-term, hard-physical realities: the thermal balance of the atmosphere, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion. In this worldview, the threat is not merely a political problem to be solved with new regulations, but a fundamental challenge to the metabolic basis of modern life \u2014 the flow of energy and material resources that allow billions to live as they do. The timeline of this threat is geological, but the consequences are felt in our immediate future: crop failures, unlivable heat domes, climate refugees, and the destabilization of institutions unable to cope with cascading environmental crises. The ultimate collapse scenario is a fundamental loss of planetary habitability, rendering the sophisticated structures of liberal democracy moot when the basic needs of life (clean water, breathable air, stable food supply) are no longer guaranteed. The political solution implied by this narrative is necessarily vast, technocratic, and globalist. It requires coordination of energy generation, production cycles, transportation, and consumption patterns on a scale never before attempted in peacetime. It implies a need to transfer of (at least some parts of) sovereignty from individual nation-states to supranational regulatory bodies, and a systematic re-engineering of the global economy \u2014 a \u201cGreat Transition\u201d or \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d This shift requires moving away from fossil-fuel-driven capital accumulation toward managed, sustainable, and controlled allocation of resources. It represents a cornerstone of the modern Left\u2019s agenda. The Right\u2019s view of this narrative is not merely skepticism; it is outright rejection, seeing the Metabolic Threat as a pernicious fiction. From this perspective, climate change is not a genuine crisis but a Trojan horse for technocratic-globalist control. The emergency rhetoric is deemed a pretext for the Left and its elite allies (WEF, UN, technologists, etc.) to seize control of national economies, strip away individual liberties, and enforce a centrally planned, low-growth socialist model under the guise of ecological necessity. The data, the models, and the predictions are dismissed as either fabricated or deliberately manipulated to justify a pre-existing ideological agenda of economic restructuring. The Right\u2019s Doom: The Demographic Threat The second narrative of collapse is cultural, social, and civilizational. It is the Demographic Threat , and it has everywhere become the defining, non-negotiable existential fear of the nationalist Right. This doom is driven by two interlocking crises. The first is the simple, quantifiable reality of falling birth rates across the rich world. In Western Europe, the average Total Fertility Rate (TFR) hovers around 1.5 children per woman, far below the 2.1 required for population replacement. In countries like Canada, South Korea, and Italy, the numbers are even lower. This trend is creating an inverted demographic pyramid : a shrinking base of young workers supporting an ever-expanding, longer-living elderly population. The collapse scenario here is the insolvency of the welfare state, the erasure of cultural vitality, and the economic stagnation of a society running out of workers, dynamism, and, ultimately, children. The second, politically charged layer of this threat is the notion of the \u201cGreat Replacement Theory.\u201d This notion, expressed in forms ranging from coded alarmism to explicit white nationalist rhetoric, argues that immigration from the Global South \u2014 the \u201cbrown hordes\u201d of The Camp of the Saints \u2014 is not merely filling labor gaps but is part of an orchestrated, elite-driven process to replace the native (specifically, white) populations of Western nations. Collapse in this narrative takes the form of the cultural and ethnic death of the West: a loss of distinct national identity, shared heritage, and traditional values, submerged beneath an influx of foreign cultures and peoples perceived as incompatible with liberal democratic traditions. The political solution demanded by this narrative is a fierce, nativist turn: pro-natalist policies incentivizing native birth, radical restriction of immigration (at least from non-white countries), and a conscious defense of national borders and cultural identity. The solutions are inherently local, national, and culturally conservative. They require a re-traditionalization of society, particularly regarding gender roles and family structure, often demanding a rejection of global market forces and cosmopolitan liberalism perceived as corrosive to the traditional nation-state. The Left\u2019s view of this narrative is just as unforgiving as the Right\u2019s view of the Left\u2019s existential threat narrative: it is a form of racist-eugenicist scare-mongering. The Demographic Threat is dismissed as a flimsy intellectual cover for xenophobia, white supremacy, and the hoarding of resources by the already-privileged. The genuine economic problems of population aging (which are very real, as Runciman discusses) are seen as being deliberately racialized and catastrophized to justify cruelty and exclusion. The term \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d is depicted as a conspiracy theory with roots in far-right terror, used to validate a politics based purely on racial anxiety and cultural nostalgia rather than on rational policy. From this perspective, the Right\u2019s doom is not a threat to the world, but a threat from a fearful, retreating segment of society desperate to maintain inherited economic and ethnocultural privilege. The Zero-Sum Tragic Schism The tragedy of modern politics is that both narratives speak to a deep, often legitimate anxiety about the future, yet both are regarded by the opposing camp as essentially a malicious fantasy. This is not a simple policy disagreement; it is a fundamental clash of metaphysical priorities. The Left\u2019s priority is the health of the planetary biosphere. All other concerns \u2014 national identity, existing economic structures, cultural continuity \u2014 are secondary to the imperative of surviving the ecological breakdown. By contrast, the Right\u2019s priority is the health of the nation (defined ethnoculturally). All other concerns \u2014 carbon budgets, global regulatory structures, technological shifts \u2014 are secondary to the imperative of surviving the demographic and cultural erosion. To the climate activist, worrying about the racial composition of a nation on a planet with a non-functioning atmosphere is the height of anthropocentric-narcissistic absurdity. To the demographic nationalist, allowing a global elite to destroy your national economy and cultural integrity to fight an exaggerated, speculative climate model is an act of self-imposed national suicide. The duopoly of doom creates a zero-sum political game. The Left requires globalism to solve its crisis; the Right requires nativism to solve its crisis. Because their required solutions are antithetical, they must first delegitimize the other\u2019s fundamental crisis. The result is a political system locked in a permanent, circular loop of accusation, denial, and distraction, paralyzed by the inability to agree on the very definition of the crisis we face. We are not just debating policy; we are debating what it means to be \u201cdoomed,\u201d and whether the collapse will be green or brown. But as David Runciman points out, narratives aside, these two macro-trends \u2014 falling birth rates in the Global North and the advance of climate change \u2014 are fated to interact inexorably: In the face of declining populations and growing strains on labour forces, rich countries will become more and more dependent on immigration to maintain numbers. At the same time, as those parts of the world with growing populations become less habitable because of climate change, the impetus to move from South to North will increase. Just one of these factors on its own \u2014 either depopulation in the North or climate change in the South \u2014 could be enough to drive mass migration. Taken together they make it inevitable. Anyone who thinks the 21st century will not see the biggest global movement of peoples in history has not been paying attention. That there will be massive migration by the end of the century is one of the clearest examples I can think of what my old boss Peter Schwartz liked to call an \u201cinevitable surprise.\u201d",

Colophon : All the rest. Meta's new top EU regulator is contractually prohibited from saying mean things about Meta ( permalink ) \"Regulatory capture\" is one of those concepts that can seem nebulous and abstract. How can you really know when a regulator has failed to protect you because they were in bed with the companies they were supposed to be regulating, and when this is just because they're bad at their job. \"Never attribute to malice,\" etc etc. The difficulty of pinning down real instances of regulatory capture is further complicated by the arguments of right-wing economists, who claim that regulatory capture is inevitable, that companies will always grow to the point where they can overpower the state and use it to shut down smaller companies before they can become a threat. They use this as an argument for abolishing all regulation, rather than, you know, stopping monopolies from growing until they are more powerful than the state: https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/05/regulatory-capture/ Despite this confusion, there are times when regulatory capture is anything but subtle. Especially these times, when the corporate world, spooked by the pandemic-era surge in antitrust enforcement, have launched a gloves-off/mask-off offensive to simply take over their governments, abandoning any pretext of being responsive to democratically accountable processes or agencies. You've got David Sacks, Trump's billionaire AI czar, who is directing American AI policy while holding (hundreds of?) millions of dollars worth of stock in companies that stand to directly benefit from his work in the US government: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/technology/david-sacks-white-house-profits.html?unlocked_article_code=1.5E8.Nb2d.3L204EF4nliq Sacks has threatened the New York Times , demanding that they \"abandon\" the story about his conflicts of interest: https://protos.com/david-sacks-sends-silly-legal-threat-to-the-new-york-times/ And he's hired the law-firm that is at the center of a decades-long open conspiracy to end press freedom in America, bankrolled and overseen by the same people who planned and executed the destruction of American abortion rights: https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/17/actual-malice/#happy-slapping This isn't a strictly US affair, either. In the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer rang in 2025 by firing the country's top competition regulator and replacing him with the former head of Amazon UK, one of the country's most notorious monopolists, whose tax evasion, labor abuses, and anticompetitive mergers and tactics had been on the Competition and Markets Authority's agenda for years: https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/22/autocrats-of-trade/#dingo-babysitter Today, this same swindle is playing out in Canada. Competition Commissioner Matthew Boswell \u2013 recently endowed with the most sweeping enforcement powers of any competition regulator in the world \u2013 has resigned early. Now, Canada's monopolists are openly calling for one of their own top execs to take over the office for the next five years, citing a bizarre Canadian tradition of alternating between civil servants and revolving-door corporate insiders in turn: https://www.donotpassgo.ca/p/competition-commissioner-matthew However, there is one country that always, always brings home the gold in the Regulatory Capture Olympics: Ireland. Ireland had the misfortune to establish itself as a tax haven, meaning it makes pennies by helping the worst corporations in the world (especially US Big Tech companies) hide billions from global tax authorities. Being a tax haven sucks, because tax havens must also function as crime havens. After all, the tech companies that pretend to be Irish have no loyalty to the country \u2013 they are there solely because Ireland will help them cheat the rest of the world. What's more, any company that can hire lawyers to do the paperwork to let it pretend that it's Irish this week could pay those lawyers to pretend that it is Cypriot, or Maltese, or Dutch, or Luxembourgeois next week. To keep these American companies from skipping town, Ireland must bend its entire justice system to the facilitation of all of American tech companies' crimes. Of course, there is no class of crime that American tech companies commit more flagrantly or consequentially than the systematic, ruthless invasion of our privacy. Nine years ago, the EU passed the landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a big, muscular privacy law that bans virtually all of the data-collection undertaken by America's tech companies. However, because these companies pretend they are Irish, they have been able to move all GDPR enforcement to Ireland, where the Data Protection Commissioner could always be relied upon to let these companies get away with murder: https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze/#dirty-old-town If you have formed the (widespread) opinion that the GDPR is worse than useless, responsible for nothing more than an endless stream of bullshit \"cookie consent\" pop-ups, blame the Irish DPC. American tech companies have pretended that they are allowed to substitute these cookie popups for doing the thing the GDPR demands on them (not spying on you at all). This is an obvious violation of the GDPR, and the only way an enforcer could possibly fail to see this is if they served a government whose entire economy depended on keeping Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai happy. It's impossible to explain something to a regulator when their paycheck depends on them not understanding it. Incredibly, Ireland has found a way to make this awful situation even worse . They've appointed Niamh Sweeney, an ex-Meta lobbyist, to the role of Irish Data Protection Commissioner. Her resume includes \"six years at Meta, according to her LinkedIn profile. She was head of public policy, Ireland for Facebook before becoming WhatsApp\u2019s director of public policy for Europe, Middle East and Africa\": https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/17/ex-tech-lobbyist-named-to-data-protection-commission/ In their complaint to the European Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties lays out a devastating case against Sweeney's fitness to serve \u2013 the fact that she has broad, deep, obvious conflicts of interest that should automatically disqualify her from the role: https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/complaint-v-ireland-to-european-commission-re-process-appointing-ex-meta-lobbyist-as-data-protection-commissioner/#_ftn11 Among other things, Meta execs \u2013 like Sweeney \u2013 are given piles of stock options and shares in the company. The decisions that Sweeney will be called upon to make as DPC will have a significant and lasting negative effect on Meta's stocks \u2013 if Meta is banned from surveilling 500m affluent European consumers, they will make a lot less money. But that's just for starters. Meta execs also sign contracts that bind them to: Nondisparagement: ex-Meta executives are permanently barred from \"making any disparaging, crucial or otherwise detrimental comments to any person or entity concerning [Meta's] products, services or programs; its business affairs, operation, management and financial condition\u2026\" Nondisclosure: ex-Meta executives are broadly prohibited from discussing their employment, or disclosing the things they learned while working at the company. Forced arbitration: if Meta believes that a former exec has violated these clauses, they can order the former exec to be silent, and bill them tens of thousands of dollars every time they speak out. Former executives sign away the right to contest these fines and orders in front of a judge; instead, all claims are heard by an \"arbitrator\" \u2013 a corporate lawyer who is paid by Meta and is in charge of deciding whether Meta (who pays their invoices) is right or wrong. We know about these contractual terms because they have been applied to Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former top Meta exec who published a whistleblower memoir, Careless People , which discloses many of Meta's most terrible practices, from systemic sexual harassment at the highest echelon to a worldwide surveillance collaboration with the Chinese government to complicity in the Rohingya genocide, to the fact that Mark Zuckerberg cheats at Settlers of Catan and his underlings let him win: https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf Meta dragged Wynn-Williams in front of Meta's pet arbitrator over the statements in her book (without disputing their truthfulness). The arbitrator has fined Wynn-Williams $111,000,000 for speaking out ($50,000 per violation), and has barred her from promoting her book in any way. The company has ordered her not to testify before the US Congress or the UK Parliament. The clauses in Wynn-Williams contract are very similar (if not identical) to the clauses that the US National Labor Relations Board ruled unenforceable: https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/employment-law/nlrb-rules-metas-7200-confidentiality-agreements-unlawful/499180 Wynn-Williams appeared on stage with me last month at London's Barbican Centre, in a book-tour event moderated by Chris Morris. Whenever we talked about Meta or Careless People , Wynn-Williams would fall silent and assume a blank facial expression, lest she make another statement that would result in Meta seeking another $50,000 from her under the terms of her contract. In their complaint to the EU, ICCL raises the extremely likely probability that Sweeney is bound by the same contractual terms as Wynn-Williams, meaning that Meta's top regulator in Ireland, the country where Meta pretends to be based, will be contractually prohibited from saying anything that makes Mark Zuckerberg feel bad about himself. This isn't just a matter for Ireland, either. Given the nature of European federalism, most of Meta's violations of European privacy laws will start with the Irish DPC \u2013 in other words, all 500,000,000 Europeans will be forced to complain to someone who is legally barred from upsetting Zuck's digestion. Tax havens are a global scourge. By allowing American tech companies to evade their taxes around the world, Ireland is complicit in starving countries everywhere of tax revenue they are properly owed. Perhaps even worse than this, though, is the fact that these cod-Irish American companies can always out-compete their domestic rivals all over the world, because those companies have to pay tax, while Meta does not. Ireland has been every bit as important in exporting US Big Tech around the world as the US has been. But Ireland has another key export, one that is confined to the European Union. Because every tax haven must be a crime haven, and because Big Tech's favorite crime is illegal surveillance, Ireland has exported American tech spying to the whole European Union. That's how things stand today, and how they've stood since the passage of the GDPR. If you'd asked me a year ago, I would have said that this is as terrible as things could get. But now that Ireland has put an ex-Meta exec in charge of deciding whether Meta is invading Europeans' privacy, without confirming whether this dingo babysitter is even allowed to criticize Meta , it's clear that things could get much worse than I ever imagined.

How can you <em>really</em> know when a regulator has failed to protect you because they were in bed with the companies they were supposed to be regulating, and when this is just because they're bad at their job. \"Never attribute to malice,\" etc etc.</p>\n<p>The difficulty of pinning down real instances of regulatory capture is further complicated by the arguments of right-wing economists, who claim that regulatory capture is inevitable, that companies will always grow to the point where they can overpower the state and use it to shut down smaller companies before they can become a threat. They use this as an argument for abolishing <em>all</em> regulation, rather than, you know, stopping monopolies from growing until they are more powerful than the state:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/05/regulatory-capture/\">https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/05/regulatory-capture/</a></p>\n<p>Despite this confusion, there are times when regulatory capture is anything <em>but</em> subtle. Especially these times, when the corporate world, spooked by the pandemic-era surge in antitrust enforcement, have launched a gloves-off/mask-off offensive to simply take over their governments, abandoning any pretext of being responsive to democratically accountable processes or agencies.</p>\n<p>You've got David Sacks, Trump's billionaire AI czar, who is directing American AI policy while holding (hundreds of?) millions of dollars worth of stock in companies that stand to directly benefit from his work in the US government:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/technology/david-sacks-white-house-profits.html?unlocked_article_code=1.5E8.Nb2d.3L204EF4nliq\">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/technology/david-sacks-white-house-profits.html?unlocked_article_code=1.5E8.Nb2d.3L204EF4nliq</a></p>\n<p>Sacks has threatened the <em>New York Times</em>, demanding that they \"abandon\" the story about his conflicts of interest:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://protos.com/david-sacks-sends-silly-legal-threat-to-the-new-york-times/\">https://protos.com/david-sacks-sends-silly-legal-threat-to-the-new-york-times/</a></p>\n<p>And he's hired the law-firm that is at the center of a decades-long open conspiracy to end press freedom in America, bankrolled and overseen by the same people who planned and executed the destruction of American abortion rights:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/17/actual-malice/#happy-slapping\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/17/actual-malice/#happy-slapping</a></p>\n<p>This isn't a strictly US affair, either. In the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer rang in 2025 by firing the country's top competition regulator and replacing him with the former head of Amazon UK, one of the country's most notorious monopolists, whose tax evasion, labor abuses, and anticompetitive mergers and tactics had been on the Competition and Markets Authority's agenda for years:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/22/autocrats-of-trade/#dingo-babysitter\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/22/autocrats-of-trade/#dingo-babysitter</a></p>\n<p>Today, this same swindle is playing out in Canada. Competition Commissioner Matthew Boswell &#8211; recently endowed with the most sweeping enforcement powers of any competition regulator in the world &#8211; has resigned early. Now, Canada's monopolists are openly calling for one of their own top execs to take over the office for the next five years, citing a bizarre Canadian tradition of alternating between civil servants and revolving-door corporate insiders in turn:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.donotpassgo.ca/p/competition-commissioner-matthew\">https://www.donotpassgo.ca/p/competition-commissioner-matthew</a></p>\n<p>However, there is one country that always, always brings home the gold in the Regulatory Capture Olympics: Ireland. Ireland had the misfortune to establish itself as a tax haven, meaning it makes pennies by helping the worst corporations in the world (especially US Big Tech companies) hide billions from global tax authorities. Being a tax haven sucks, because tax havens must <em>also</em> function as <em>crime</em> havens.</p>\n<p>After all, the tech companies that pretend to be Irish have no loyalty to the country &#8211; they are there solely because Ireland will help them cheat the rest of the world. What's more, any company that can hire lawyers to do the paperwork to let it pretend that it's Irish this week could pay those lawyers to pretend that it is Cypriot, or Maltese, or Dutch, or Luxembourgeois next week. To keep these American companies from skipping town, Ireland must bend its entire justice system to the facilitation of <em>all</em> of American tech companies' crimes.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is no class of crime that American tech companies commit more flagrantly or consequentially than the systematic, ruthless invasion of our privacy. Nine years ago, the EU passed the landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a big, muscular privacy law that bans virtually all of the data-collection undertaken by America's tech companies. However, because these companies pretend they are Irish, they have been able to move all GDPR enforcement to Ireland, where the Data Protection Commissioner could always be relied upon to let these companies get away with murder:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze/#dirty-old-town\">https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze/#dirty-old-town</a></p>\n<p>If you have formed the (widespread) opinion that the GDPR is worse than useless, responsible for nothing more than an endless stream of bullshit \"cookie consent\" pop-ups, blame the Irish DPC. American tech companies have pretended that they are allowed to substitute these cookie popups for doing the thing the GDPR demands on them (not spying on you at all). This is an obvious violation of the GDPR, and the only way an enforcer could possibly fail to see this is if they served a government whose entire economy depended on keeping Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai happy. It's impossible to explain something to a regulator when their paycheck depends on them not understanding it.</p>\n<p>Incredibly, Ireland has found a way to make this awful situation <em>even worse</em>. They've appointed Niamh Sweeney, an ex-Meta lobbyist, to the role of Irish Data Protection Commissioner. Her resume includes \"six years at Meta, according to her LinkedIn profile. She was head of public policy, Ireland for Facebook before becoming WhatsApp\u2019s director of public policy for Europe, Middle East and Africa\":</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/17/ex-tech-lobbyist-named-to-data-protection-commission/\">https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/17/ex-tech-lobbyist-named-to-data-protection-commission/</a></p>\n<p>In their complaint to the European Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties lays out a devastating case against Sweeney's fitness to serve &#8211; the fact that she has broad, deep, obvious conflicts of interest that should automatically disqualify her from the role:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/complaint-v-ireland-to-european-commission-re-process-appointing-ex-meta-lobbyist-as-data-protection-commissioner/#_ftn11\">https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/complaint-v-ireland-to-european-commission-re-process-appointing-ex-meta-lobbyist-as-data-protection-commissioner/#_ftn11</a></p>\n<p>Among other things, Meta execs &#8211; like Sweeney &#8211; are given piles of stock options and shares in the company. The decisions that Sweeney will be called upon to make as DPC will have a significant and lasting negative effect on Meta's stocks &#8211; if Meta is banned from surveilling 500m affluent European consumers, they will make a <em>lot</em> less money.</p>\n<p>But that's just for starters. Meta execs also sign contracts that bind them to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nondisparagement: ex-Meta executives are permanently barred from \"making any disparaging, crucial or otherwise detrimental comments to any person or entity concerning [Meta's] products, services or programs; its business affairs, operation, management and financial condition&#8230;\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nondisclosure: ex-Meta executives are broadly prohibited from discussing their employment, or disclosing the things they learned while working at the company.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Forced arbitration: if Meta believes that a former exec has violated these clauses, they can order the former exec to be silent, and bill them tens of thousands of dollars every time they speak out. Former executives sign away the right to contest these fines and orders in front of a judge; instead, all claims are heard by an \"arbitrator\" &#8211; a corporate lawyer who is paid by Meta and is in charge of deciding whether Meta (who pays their invoices) is right or wrong.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We know about these contractual terms because they have been applied to Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former top Meta exec who published a whistleblower memoir, <em>Careless People</em>, which discloses many of Meta's most terrible practices, from systemic sexual harassment at the highest echelon to a worldwide surveillance collaboration with the Chinese government to complicity in the Rohingya genocide, to the fact that Mark Zuckerberg cheats at Settlers of Catan and his underlings let him win:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf</a></p>\n<p>Meta dragged Wynn-Williams in front of Meta's pet arbitrator over the statements in her book (without disputing their truthfulness). The arbitrator has fined Wynn-Williams $111,000,000 for speaking out ($50,000 per violation), and has barred her from promoting her book in any way. The company has ordered her not to testify before the US Congress or the UK Parliament. The clauses in Wynn-Williams contract are very similar (if not identical) to the clauses that the US National Labor Relations Board ruled unenforceable:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/employment-law/nlrb-rules-metas-7200-confidentiality-agreements-unlawful/499180\">https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/employment-law/nlrb-rules-metas-7200-confidentiality-agreements-unlawful/499180</a></p>\n<p>Wynn-Williams appeared on stage with me last month at London's Barbican Centre, in a book-tour event moderated by Chris Morris. Whenever we talked about Meta or <em>Careless People</em>, Wynn-Williams would fall silent and assume a blank facial expression, lest she make another statement that would result in Meta seeking another $50,000 from her under the terms of her contract.</p>\n<p>In their complaint to the EU, ICCL raises the extremely likely probability that Sweeney is bound by the same contractual terms as Wynn-Williams, meaning that Meta's top regulator in Ireland, the country where Meta pretends to be based, will be contractually prohibited from saying anything that makes Mark Zuckerberg feel bad about himself.</p>\n<p>This isn't just a matter for Ireland, either. Given the nature of European federalism, most of Meta's violations of European privacy laws will start with the Irish DPC &#8211; in other words, all 500,000,000 Europeans will be forced to complain to someone who is legally barred from upsetting Zuck's digestion.</p>\n<p>Tax havens are a global scourge. By allowing American tech companies to evade their taxes around the world, Ireland is complicit in starving countries everywhere of tax revenue they are properly owed. Perhaps even worse than this, though, is the fact that these cod-Irish American companies can always out-compete their domestic rivals all over the world, because those companies have to pay tax, while Meta does not. Ireland has been every bit as important in exporting US Big Tech around the world as the US has been.</p>\n<p>But Ireland has another key export, one that is confined to the European Union. Because every tax haven must be a crime haven, and because Big Tech's favorite crime is illegal surveillance, Ireland has exported American tech spying to the whole European Union.</p>\n<p>That's how things stand today, and how they've stood since the passage of the GDPR. If you'd asked me a year ago, I would have said that this is as terrible as things could get. But now that Ireland has put an ex-Meta exec in charge of deciding whether Meta is invading Europeans' privacy, without confirming whether this dingo babysitter <em>is even allowed to criticize Meta</em>, it's clear that things could get much worse than I ever imagined.</p>\n<p>(<i>Image: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HAL9000.svg\">Cryteria</a>, <a

On Thursday, the group of lawmakers, all former members of those communities, posted an online video that urged their former colleagues to consider the constitutionality of orders given them by the Trump administration if they believe the orders to be unlawful. \u201cNo one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution,\u201d the group said in the video. \u201cThis administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,\u201d they stated. \"Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats to our Constitution aren\u2019t just coming from abroad but from right here at home.\u201d In his online responses , President Trump called the statements \u201cSEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR\u201d in three separate posts. He also claimed, \u201cEach one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,\u201d and that seditious behavior was \u201cpunishable by DEATH!\u201d White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt later clarified that Trump was not calling for the execution of the lawmakers, that the administration\u2019s orders were lawful, and she believed the lawmakers were encouraging current service members to defy the chain of command. The Constitution on Treason and Sedition The subsequent frenzy of media coverage and fact checking after the exchanges raised several questions about the context of Trump\u2019s statements, and comments from the group that includes two senators, Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, and four members of the House of Representatives, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan, and Jason Crow. All six officials are Democrats. One primary issue is the most serious question raised by the president about treasonable actions possibly punishable by death . The Constitution\u2019s Article 3, Section 3 defines what is considered treason in the United States: \u201cTreason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\u201d Under this narrow definition there only have been about 30 treason trials in the United States since 1789 . Treason charges also require the testimony of two witnesses or an open confession of the accused in court. Ethel and Julius Rosenberg were the last people in the U.S. involved in a treason-related trial to be convicted, sentenced to death, and then executed. The Rosenbergs were charged with espionage conspiracy under Title 50, U.S. Code, Section 34, also known as the Espionage Act. The concept of sedition has an equally long constitutional history. In October 1799, President John Adams and the Federalists jailed the Vermont publisher Matthew Lyon, for criticizing Adams in print and in front of crowds. Lyon also was a sitting member of the House of Representatives when put on trial. The administration charged Lyon under the 1798 Sedition Act , which sought to suppress dissent and criticism of the government when war with France seemed possible, and Adams\u2019 re-election was unsure. A jury found Lyon guilty on all charges, and he was sentenced to four months in jail and a $1,000 fine. The act expired when Adams left office in 1801. President Woodrow Wilson pressed in 1918 for a second Sedition Act during World War I as an amendment to the Espionage Act. The amended language made it a crime to \u201cutter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane . . . or abusive language\u201d about the United States government or to disagree with its actions overseas. About 2,000 people were indicted under the act and related laws in 1919 and 1920, and 1,000 were convicted before the Harding administration repealed the statutes. Seditious Conspiracy under Legal Statutes While the lawmakers\u2019 statements and Trump\u2019s responses may not fit the traditional definitions of treason and sedition, the current debate focuses on several statutes that apply to seditious behavior and the code of conduct for military members. Under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2384 , the Seditious Conspiracy statute, \u201cIf two or more persons in any State or Territory\u201d conspire to \u201coppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States,\u201d they may be subject to fines and imprisonment up to 20 years. Also, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice , Article 92 states that military members have an obligation to follow lawful orders issued by their commanders. But what constitutes an unlawful order? In a 2020 post on the blog Just Security , Eugene R. Fidell of the Yale School of Law narrowed in on a definition of what could be an unlawful order based on the Manual for Courts-Martial . Such an order would be one that \u201ca person of ordinary sense and understanding\u201d would know to be unlawful,\u201d Fidell states, citing the precedent of the My Lai massacre trial of Lieutenant William Calley in 1970. Fidell also notes that the Manual for Courts-Martial says any order given by a superior \u201cmust not conflict with the statutory or constitutional rights of the person receiving the order.\u201d Free Speech Arguments As a practical matter, the vagueness of the statements by the lawmakers and Trump makes any prosecution under the statutes problematic . For example, the video from the six lawmakers does not state which orders from the Trump administration they consider as unlawful. And numerous experts on the subject doubt that military members in the field could have the ability to determine the lawfulness of an order unless it met the narrowness defined in the examples posed by Fidell. In a hypothetical case posed after the statements by the lawmakers, the legality of the administration\u2019s use of National Guard troops in domestic situations was suggested an implied example from the group. That very question of lawfulness is under consideration in federal appeals courts today. Another broader question is the free speech rights of the six lawmakers and President Trump, which could protect their statements as the root cause of lawsuits or actions based on the message or content of each speaker. The First Amendment protects political speech strongly; a series of Supreme Court decisions concluding with Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) held that political speech is protected unless it is \u201cdirected to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\u201d In a prior dissent from Justice Louis Brandeis in Whitney v. California (1927), he articulated the founders\u2019 understanding of such rights. \u201cThey believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that, without free speech and assembly, discussion would be futile.\u201d Scott Bomboy is the editor in chief of the National Constitution Center.",

        "full_content": "On one side, the Trump administration is sinking small boats that it claims, without evidence, are smuggling drugs \u2014 and according to the Washington Post , Pete Hegseth, the self-styled Secretary of War, has personally ordered at least one follow-up strike to kill the survivors. A working group of former JAGs, that is, members of the military\u2019s legal branch, issued a statement declaring that it unanimously considers both the giving and the execution of these orders, if true, to constitute war crimes, murder, or both. On the other side, Donald Trump has declared his intention to grant \u201ca Full and Complete Pardon\u201d to Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, a former president of Honduras who has been convicted of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States. In fact, Hernandez was part of a cartel, including his brother, that smuggled hundreds of tons of cocaine into this country. At first glance, the juxtaposition seems bizarre \u2013 Trump is either murdering or committing war crimes against people who are at worst small-time drug smugglers, and may be innocent fishermen, while pardoning a drug lord who was responsible for thousands of American deaths while savaging his own country, Honduras. But there is a pattern to this murderous madness, once one connects the dots between Trump\u2019s mob-boss persona and the billionaire crypto/tech broligarchy. First, understand that Trump\u2019s vendetta against purported penny-ante drug smugglers is all about dominance display, an exhibition of his ability to order violence. The real object may be to set the stage for invadingVenezuela. Second, while Trump is clearly willing to inflict gratuitous suffering on the little people, he positively revels in his association with big-time criminals, whether it\u2019s Putin; or Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who had a critical journalist dismembered with a bone saw ; or Ross Ulbricht, creator of Silk Road, an underground e-marketplace known for drug trafficking , whom Trump pardoned immediately after assuming office; or Larry Hoover, a Chicago crime boss, who was sentenced to several lifetimes in prison for leading the Gangster Disciples, also pardoned by Trump . Yes, Trump really and truly cares about crime in Chicago. Still, why would Trump, whose poll numbers are cratering, generate even more negative headlines by pardoning Hern\u00e1ndez, who was duly convicted of conspiring to send more than 400 tons (!) of cocaine to America? The answer is the influence of the crypto/tech broligarchy. In fact, many of Trump\u2019s pardons of the most egregious criminals are closely linked to their influence. A case in point is Ulbricht, whose Silk Road was an early example of what is still the main non-speculative use of Bitcoin: facilitating criminal activity. Ross Ulbricht was a darling of the tech-libertarian crowd, which includes Peter Thiel, arguably the godfather of Silicon Valley and whose financial backing was critical to JD Vance\u2019s senate win. Trump first promised to pardon Ulbricht in 2024, as part of a pitch to win the votes of libertarians : Trump at the Libertarian Party national conference in 2024, where he promised to pardon Ulbricht A closeup: This is an anarchist symbol Whatever libertarians were in the past, they are now an extremist party, opposed to laws against drug smuggling, money laundering, any type of prudential government regulation, and \u2013 in the case of Thiel \u2013 opposed to democracy itself . It should not go unnoticed that Trump saluted a party that proclaims \u201cBecome Ungovernable\u201d as its guiding principle, written with the anarchy a-symbol. Next, Trump\u2019s pardon of Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, the former CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, fits the same pattern. CZ pled guilty to charges of violating U.S. laws against money-laundering and was fined $50 million, in addition to a fine of $4.3 billion against Binance. Under CZ, Binance was a major channel of worldwide money laundering. As one repor t put it, prosecutors charged that Binance intentionally and purposefully ignored the transfer of money from countries and areas that are subject to sanctions -- including Syria, Iran, Cuba, Russia-occupied Crimea and the Donbas region in Ukraine. There was also trading that involved the criminal dark-web market Hydra. And the story continues . Last week The families of 300 U.S. citizens hurt or killed in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel sued Binance, claiming the cryptocurrency exchange aided Hamas and other terrorist groups by transferring more than $1 billion among accounts they controlled. However, in the world of radical libertarians, of the crypto/tech broligarchy, CZ\u2019s crimes weren\u2019t real crimes because crypto is designed to \u201cfree\u201d us from the pernicious oversight of government. Yes, Trump really cares about stopping terrorism. Finally, why pardon Hern\u00e1ndez? What\u2019s the connection to the crypto/tech broligarchy? It\u2019s called Pr\u00f3spera. Pr\u00f3spera is a for-profit city being built off Honduras\u2019s coast. Its charter largely exempts the island from Honduran law. Instead, the city is run by a governing structure that for the most part gives control to a corporation, Honduras Pr\u00f3spera Inc., which is in turn funded by a familiar list of Silicon Valley billionaires including Thiel, Sam Altman and Marc Andreesen. So while the city is being marketed as a libertarian paradise, it\u2019s best seen as an autonomous oligarchy, government of, by and for billionaires. And you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that within Pr\u00f3spera, Bitcoin is legal tender. The 2013 Honduran law that made the creation of Pr\u00f3spera possible was initially ruled unconstitutional by the Honduran Supreme Court. But that ruling was reversed after Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s predecessor, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, managed to dismiss 4 of the court\u2019s justices. Like Hern\u00e1ndez, Sosa was a right-winger, who became president after a populist president, Manuel Zelaya, was overthrown by a military coup. Under both Hern\u00e1ndez and Sosa, chaos reigned \u2013 corruption, criminal gangs, and drugs overran the country. The current president, Zelaya\u2019s wife, has tried to claw back some sovereignty over Pr\u00f3spera, which has struck back with a mammoth lawsuit that could bankrupt the country. Yesterday Honduras held an election in which Trump backed Nasry Asfura, a member of the same right-wing party as Hern\u00e1ndez. Early results show the governing left-wing party well behind, but Asfura in a virtual tie with another right-wing candidate. In any case, the point is that while Trump threatens and fulminates against Maduro in Venezuela, he is openly backing the Honduran political party that has allowed massive drug smuggling into the U.S. Why? The only logical answer is because of the influence of the crypto/tech broligarchy and their interests in Pr\u00f3spera. So the announced pardon of Hern\u00e1ndez for drug smuggling isn\u2019t really a departure from the pardons of Binance\u2019s Changpeng Zhao for money laundering or Silk Road\u2019s Ross Ulbricht for facilitating illicit drug sales.

A working group of former JAGs, that is, members of the military&#8217;s legal branch, issued a <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/former-jag-working-group-no-quarter-statement.pdf\">statement</a> declaring that it</p><blockquote><p>unanimously considers both the giving and the execution of these orders, if true, to constitute war crimes, murder, or both.</p></blockquote><p>On the other side, Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/world/americas/trump-pardon-honduras-hernandez.html\">declared his intention</a> to grant &#8220;a Full and Complete Pardon&#8221; to Juan Orlando Hern&#225;ndez, a former president of Honduras who has been convicted of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.<strong> </strong>In fact, Hernandez was part of a cartel, including his brother, that smuggled hundreds of tons of cocaine into this country.</p><p>At first glance, the juxtaposition seems bizarre &#8211; Trump is either murdering or committing war crimes against people who are at worst small-time drug smugglers, and may be innocent fishermen, while pardoning a drug lord who was responsible for thousands of American deaths while savaging his own country, Honduras. But there is a pattern to this murderous madness, once one connects the dots between Trump&#8217;s mob-boss persona and the billionaire crypto/tech broligarchy.</p><p>First, understand that Trump&#8217;s vendetta against purported penny-ante drug smugglers is all about dominance display, an exhibition of his ability to order violence. The real object may be to set the stage for invadingVenezuela.</p><p>Second, while Trump is clearly willing to inflict gratuitous suffering on the little people, he positively revels in his association with big-time criminals, whether it&#8217;s Putin; or Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who had a critical journalist <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/saudi-arabia/un-investigator-trumps-defense-saudi-crown-prince-jamal-khashoggi-rcna244757\">dismembered with a bone saw</a>; or Ross Ulbricht, creator of Silk Road, an underground e-marketplace known for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/21/nx-s1-5270051/trump-pardons-dark-web-marketplace-creator-ross-ulbricht\">drug trafficking</a>, whom Trump pardoned immediately after assuming office; or Larry Hoover, a Chicago crime boss, who was sentenced to several lifetimes in prison for leading the Gangster Disciples, also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/31/nx-s1-5415939/trump-pardons-drug-kingpins-even-as-he-escalates-the-u-s-drug-war\">pardoned by Trump</a>. Yes, Trump really and truly cares about crime in Chicago.</p><p>Still, why would Trump, whose <a href=\"https://fiftyplusone.news/polls/approval/president\">poll numbers</a> are cratering, generate even more negative headlines by pardoning Hern&#225;ndez, who was duly convicted of conspiring to send more than <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/juan-orlando-hernandez-former-president-honduras-sentenced-45-years-prison-conspiring\">400 tons</a> (!) of cocaine to America?</p><p>The answer is the influence of the crypto/tech broligarchy. In fact, many of Trump&#8217;s pardons of the most egregious criminals are closely linked to their influence.</p><p>A case in point is Ulbricht, whose Silk Road was an early example of what is still the main non-speculative use of Bitcoin: facilitating criminal activity. Ross Ulbricht was a darling of the tech-libertarian crowd, which includes Peter Thiel, arguably the godfather of Silicon Valley and whose financial backing was critical to JD Vance&#8217;s senate win. Trump first promised to pardon Ulbricht in 2024, as part of a pitch to win the votes of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7e0jve875o\">libertarians</a>:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1c59!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3faca791-c0aa-4411-b42f-988c54583f36_1100x733.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Speaking at the Libertarian Party convention in 2024, President Donald Trump promised to free Ross Ulbricht, a former tech entrepreneur who created a dark web site called Silk Road that was used by drug traffickers.\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"733\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1c59!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3faca791-c0aa-4411-b42f-988c54583f36_1100x733.jpeg\" title=\"Speaking at the Libertarian Party convention in 2024, President Donald Trump promised to free Ross Ulbricht, a former tech entrepreneur who created a dark web site called Silk Road that was used by drug traffickers.\" width=\"1100\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Trump at the Libertarian Party national conference in 2024, where he promised to pardon Ulbricht</em></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xdsN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91bff4d-fc64-4796-8e01-10875e83d057_260x352.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"A close-up of a sign\n\nAI-generated content may be incorrect.\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xdsN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc91bff4d-fc64-4796-8e01-10875e83d057_260x352.png\" title=\"A close-up of a sign\n\nAI-generated content may be incorrect.\" width=\"260\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>A closeup: This is an anarchist symbol</em></p><p>Whatever libertarians were in the past, they are now an extremist party, opposed to laws against drug smuggling, money laundering, any type of prudential government regulation, and &#8211; in the case of Thiel &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/opinion/crypto-trump-libertarianism-corruption.html\">opposed to democracy itself</a>. It should not go unnoticed that Trump saluted a party that proclaims &#8220;Become Ungovernable&#8221; as its guiding principle, written with the anarchy a-symbol.</p><p>Next, Trump&#8217;s pardon of Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, the former CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, fits the same pattern. CZ pled guilty to charges of violating U.S. laws against money-laundering and was fined $50 million, in addition to a fine of $4.3 billion against Binance. Under CZ, Binance was a major channel of worldwide money laundering. As <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Binance-money-laundering-scandal-explained-What-to-know\">one repor</a>t put it, prosecutors charged that Binance</p><blockquote><p>intentionally and purposefully ignored the transfer of money from countries and areas that are subject to sanctions -- including Syria, Iran, Cuba, Russia-occupied Crimea and the Donbas region in Ukraine. There was also trading that involved the criminal dark-web market Hydra.</p></blockquote><p>And the story <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/business/binance-hamas-terrorism.html\">continues</a>. Last week</p><blockquote><p>The families of 300 U.S. citizens hurt or killed in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel sued Binance, claiming the cryptocurrency exchange aided Hamas and other terrorist groups by transferring more than $1 billion among accounts they controlled.</p></blockquote><p>However, in the world of radical libertarians, of the crypto/tech broligarchy, CZ&#8217;s crimes weren&#8217;t real crimes because crypto is designed to &#8220;free&#8221; us from the pernicious oversight of government. Yes, Trump really cares about stopping terrorism.</p><p>Finally, why pardon Hern&#225;ndez? What&#8217;s the connection to the crypto/tech broligarchy? It&#8217;s called Pr&#243;spera.</p><p>Pr&#243;spera is a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/magazine/prospera-honduras-crypto.html\">for-profit city</a> being built off Honduras&#8217;s coast. Its charter largely exempts the island from Honduran law. Instead, the city is run by a governing structure that for the most part gives control to a corporation, Honduras Pr&#243;spera Inc., which is in turn funded by a familiar list of Silicon Valley billionaires including Thiel, Sam Altman and Marc Andreesen.</p><p>So while the city is being marketed as a libertarian paradise, it&#8217;s best seen as an autonomous oligarchy, government of, by and for billionaires. And you won&#8217;t be surprised to learn that within Pr&#243;spera, Bitcoin is legal tender.</p><p>The 2013 Honduran law that made the creation of Pr&#243;spera possible was initially ruled unconstitutional by the Honduran Supreme Court. But that ruling was reversed after Juan Orlando Hern&#225;ndez&#8217;s predecessor, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, managed to dismiss 4 of the court&#8217;s justices. Like Hern&#225;ndez, Sosa was a right-winger, who became president after a populist president, Manuel Zelaya, was overthrown by a military coup. Under both Hern&#225;ndez and Sosa, chaos reigned &#8211; corruption, criminal gangs, and drugs overran the country. The current president, Zelaya&#8217;s wife, has tried to claw back some sovereignty over Pr&#243;spera, which has struck back with a mammoth lawsuit that could bankrupt the country.</p><p>Yesterday Honduras held an election in which Trump backed Nasry Asfura, a member of the same right-wing party as Hern&#225;ndez. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/world/americas/honduras-election.html\">Early results</a> show the governing left-wing party well behind, but Asfura in a virtual tie with another right-wing candidate.</p><p>In any case, the point is that while Trump threatens and fulminates against Maduro in Venezuela, he is openly backing the Honduran political party that has allowed massive drug smuggling into the U.S. Why? The only logical answer is because of the influence of the crypto/tech broligarchy and their interests in Pr&#243;spera.</p><p>So the announced pardon of Hern&#225;ndez for drug smuggling isn&#8217;t really a departure from the pardons of Binance&#8217;s Changpeng Zhao for money laundering or Silk Road&#8217;s Ross Ulbricht for facilitating illicit drug sales. In each case what&#8217;s being upheld is the principle that lawlessness in the pursuit of tech billionaires&#8217; interests is no vice. In fact, it&#8217;s to be encouraged.</p><p>And Trump, whose only principles appear to be self-enrichment and vindictiveness, is happy to go along.</p><p>MUSICAL CODA</p><div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-k7OwGS3jJ4E\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div>"

A senior lecturer on global health at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health from 1979 until his death in Oct. 2024, Cash is renowned for his key role in the development of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT), a combination of sugar, salt, and water that proved remarkably effective at rehydrating people suffering from cholera and other diarrheal diseases. It\u2019s been called potentially the most significant medical advance of the 20 th century by the Lancet and is credited with saving an estimated 82 million lives around the world since the 1970s. Portrait of Richard Cash / Image provided courtesy of the artist, Stephen Coit At a memorial celebration held in Kresge G1 on Nov. 21, Cash\u2019s colleagues in the Department of Global Health and Population (GHP) joined collaborators from around the world, former students, friends, and family members to remember his life and achievements as a public health pioneer, educator, and mentor. During a panel discussion and in-person and recorded remarks, speakers described Cash as an unconventional thinker who was warm, generous, insatiably curious about the world and other people, and always up for a good debate. In her introductory remarks, Marcia Castro , Andelot Professor of Demography and GHP chair, recalled meeting Cash while she was interviewing to join the Harvard Chan School faculty. He showed her his statue of Shitala, the Hindu goddess of smallpox, and joked that there hadn\u2019t been any cases of smallpox since he\u2019d had the statue in his office. \u201cAt that moment, I didn\u2019t know if I was going to get the job, but I knew I wanted to be friends with him,\u201d Castro said. A Star Wars fan, Castro said that she always saw Cash as the film series\u2019 wise mentor Obi Wan Kenobi. \u201cThe Force was strong in Richard,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was firm in his beliefs, and he always spoke the truth.\u201d A lifesaving drink Soon after graduating from medical school, Cash started his work on ORT in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1967 as part of a U.S. Public Health Service response to a cholera outbreak. Patients with the disease suffer from acute diarrhea, which causes them to lose both water and salts (electrolytes). Intravenous saline was used to treat resulting cases of extreme dehydration, but in Bangladesh at that time, IV solution was expensive and difficult to supply. Working at the Pakistan-SEATO Cholera Research Laboratory, Cash and his colleague David Nalin, another young U.S. physician, conducted clinical studies that showed the effectiveness of giving patients an oral solution containing glucose and electrolytes. They published the results in a landmark paper in The Lancet in 1968. The pair later worked with a local nonprofit, the Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee (BRAC), to teach Bangladeshi mothers how to administer a version of the treatment at home using household ingredients: a pinch of salt, a fistful of sugar, and half a liter of clean water. ORT is now commonly used across the world, and Cash received numerous awards for his contributions, including Thailand\u2019s 2006 Prince Mahidol Award . Castro stressed that the development of ORT was possible because Cash and Nalin\u2014who spoke at the event about the treatment\u2019s history\u2014were in the field working directly with affected people. \u201cYou have to understand public health problems not based on all the certainties that you could have from the ivory tower, but by being there on the ground,\u201d Castro said. Over the decades following his initial work on ORT, Cash made frequent visits back to Bangladesh as well as other Asian and African nations to teach and work on public health projects. He supported the founding of the BRAC James P. Grant School of Public Health in Bangladesh, and taught there as a visiting professor for 20 years. Inspirational teacher, mentor, and debate partner Cash came to Harvard in 1977 as a fellow at the Harvard Institute for International Development and joined the School two years later. Former Dean Barry Bloom , Joan L. and Julius H. Jacobson Professor of Public Health, Emeritus, said that he and Cash often disagreed on public health issues. \u201cOur relationship was really a 25-year-long argument in the very best sense. He challenged most of my ideas and made me think again and again of how what I did could make a difference for real people,\u201d Bloom said. Sriram Venkitaraman, MPH \u201919, a physician and government officer in India, recalled Cash as an inspirational teacher. \u201cHe taught us that the best public health work begins when we start listening instead of enforcing what we already know.\u201d What made Cash great as an educator was his ability to bring his deeply rooted knowledge to life in the classroom, said Aisha Yousafzai , professor of child development and health, who co-taught with Cash. \u201cI will always cherish the wisdom that Richard so generously shared, and I hope to be able to continue, like all of us, taking that forward in the work that we do and the relationships that we build.\u201d In her closing remarks, Castro announced that GHP will launch an annual Richard A. Cash Lecture on Infectious Diseases, supported by the Richard Cash Memorial Fund . A new portrait of Cash by artist Stephen Coit was also unveiled at the event. It will be displayed in the GHP office on the 11 th floor of Building One.

He supported the founding of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=BRAC+James+P.+Grant+School+of+Public+Health&amp;oq=BRAC+James+P.+Grant+School+of+Public+Health+Richard+Cash&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRigATIHCAUQIRigAdIBCTEwODYwajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;mstk=AUtExfBFFCLEe1Zrr1AIb2UciqwxdWY3oMhVy7UyF24nRTRF62YFnqo7rPA1rOF0SyUBqpLm3Kbe1gA-CKkfUubtSTHa3ay3eARaCDbA87cKOLVoRstQMmar6vaH6WoQXaVsTX-4wLjyQh53eHJm80y9yyTUvSNrIDhPo0qMHlCuPvHrHO4&amp;csui=3&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj3nb3UnI6RAxVMGVkFHWoVPaYQgK4QegQIARAC\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BRAC James P.

Jacobson Professor of Public Health, Emeritus, said that he and Cash often disagreed on public health issues. \u201cOur relationship was really a 25-year-long argument in the very best sense. He challenged most of my ideas and made me think again and again of how what I did could make a difference for real people,\u201d Bloom said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">Sriram Venkitaraman, MPH \u201919, a physician and government officer in India, recalled Cash as an inspirational teacher. \u201cHe taught us that the best public health work begins when we start listening instead of enforcing what we already know.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">What made Cash great as an educator was his ability to bring his deeply rooted knowledge to life in the classroom, said <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/aisha-khizar-yousafzai/\">Aisha Yousafzai</a>, professor of child development and health, who co-taught with Cash. \u201cI will always cherish the wisdom that Richard so generously shared, and I hope to be able to continue, like all of us, taking that forward in the work that we do and the relationships that we build.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">In her closing remarks, Castro announced that GHP will launch an annual Richard A. Cash Lecture on Infectious Diseases, supported by the <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/department/global-health-population/richard-cash-memorial-fund/\">Richard Cash Memorial Fund</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">A new portrait of Cash by artist Stephen Coit was also unveiled at the event. It will be displayed in the GHP office on the 11<sup>th</sup> floor of Building One. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns columns-meta is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-body-small-font-size has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">About The Author</h2>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-author has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-author__content\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-author__name\">Amy Roeder</p><p class=\"wp-block-post-author__bio\">Senior Editor, Harvard Chan Magazine; Senior Writer in the Office of Communications</p></div></div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns columns-meta is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-body-small-font-size has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">Related Topics</h2>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"taxonomy-topic_taxonomy wp-block-post-terms has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\"><a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/topic/global-health/\" rel=\"tag\">Global Health</a></div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group hsph-last-updated is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-ad2f72ca wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-body-small-font-size has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">Last Updated</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-post-date__modified-date wp-block-post-date has-body-small-font-size has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\"><time datetime=\"2025-12-01T16:06:38-05:00\">December 1, 2025</time></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-body-regular-fixed-font-size has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">Featured in this article</h2>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"columns-2  wp-block-hsph-featured-people\">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people__inner\">\n\t\t\n<div class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__content\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__name has-xxs-font-size\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__link\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/marcia-c-de-castro/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcia C.de Castro\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__meta has-body-small-font-size\">Andelot Professor of Demography</span>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Marcia C.de Castro\" height=\"160\" src=\"https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/profile/Modules/CustomViewPersonGeneralInfo/PhotoHandler.ashx?NodeID=1258703\" width=\"160\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__content\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__name has-xxs-font-size\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__link\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/aisha-khizar-yousafzai/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAisha Khizar Yousafzai\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__meta has-body-small-font-size\">Professor of Child Development and Health</span>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Aisha Khizar Yousafzai\" height=\"160\" src=\"https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/profile/Modules/CustomViewPersonGeneralInfo/PhotoHandler.ashx?NodeID=68421313\" width=\"160\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card has-block-animation has-fly-in-animation\">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__content\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__name has-xxs-font-size\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"wp-block-hsph-featured-people-card__link\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/barry-r-bloom/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBarry R.

The question the speech intended to raise\u2014the one lost in the unintentionally villainous pageantry\u2014is whether and how we are to continue as a democracy and a nation of laws. For all the Twitter arguments over Biden\u2019s propositions, there has been little consideration of his premises. Democracy and the rule of law have been so frequently invoked as a part of the American political brand that we simply take it for granted that we enjoy both. Are we right to think that? Subscribe now Our glittering nation of laws observes this year two birthdays: the 70th anniversary of the National Security Agency, on which my thoughts have been recorded , and the 75th anniversary of the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA was founded in the wake of the 1947 National Security Act. The Act foresaw no need for the Courts and Congress to oversee a simple information-aggregation facility, and therefore subordinated it exclusively to the President, through the National Security Council he controls. Within a year, the young agency had already slipped the leash of its intended role of intelligence collection and analysis to establish a covert operations division. Within a decade, the CIA was directing the coverage of American news organizations, overthrowing democratically elected governments (at times merely to benefit a favored corporation ), establishing propaganda outfits to manipulate public sentiment, launching a long-running series of mind-control experiments on unwitting human subjects (purportedly contributing to the creation of the Unabomber ), and\u2014 gasp \u2014 interfering with foreign elections . From there, it was a short hop to wiretapping journalists and compiling files on Americans who opposed its wars . In 1963, no less than former President Harry Truman confessed that the very  agency he personally signed into law had transformed into something altogether different than he intended, writing: \u201cFor some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble\u2026\u201d Many today comfort themselves by imagining that the Agency has been reformed, and that such abuses are relics of the distant past, but what few reforms our democracy has won have been watered-down or compromised. The limited \u201cIntelligence Oversight\u201d role that was eventually conceded to Congress in order to placate the public has never been taken seriously by either the committee\u2019s majority\u2014which prefers cheerleading over investigating\u2014or by the Agency itself, which continues to conceal politically-sensitive operations from the very group most likely to defend them. \"Congress should have been told,\" said [Senator] Dianne Feinstein. \"We should have been briefed before the commencement of this kind of sensitive program. Director Panetta... was told that the vice president had ordered that the program not be briefed to Congress .\" How can we judge the ultimate effectiveness of oversight and reforms? Well, the CIA plotted to assassinate my friend , American whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, in 1972, yet nearly fifty years of \u201creforms\u201d did little to inhibit them from recently sketching out another political murder targeting Julian Assange . Putting that in perspective, you probably own shoes older than the CIA\u2019s most recent plot to murder a dissident... or rather the most recent plot that we know of . If you believe the Assange case to be a historical anomaly, some aberration unique to Trump White House, recall that the CIA\u2019s killings have continued in series across administrations. Obama ordered the killing of an American far from any battlefield, and killed his 16 year-old American son a few weeks later, but the man\u2019s American daughter was still alive by the time Obama left. Within a month of entering the White House, Trump killed her . She was 8 years old. Nawar al-Awlaki It goes beyond assassinations. Within recent memory, the CIA captured Gul Rahman , who we know was not Al-Qaeda, but it seems did save the life of Afghanistan\u2019s future (pro-US) President . Rahman was placed in what the Agency described as a \u201c dungeon \u201d and tortured until he died. They stripped him naked, save a diaper he couldn\u2019t change, in a cold so wicked that his guards, in their warm clothes, ran heaters for themselves. In absolute darkness, they bolted his hands and feet to a single point on the floor with a very short chain so that it was impossible to stand or lie down \u2013 a practice called \u201cshort shackling\u201d \u2013 and after he died, claimed that it was for his own safety. They admit to beating him, even describing the \u201cforceful punches.\u201d They describe the blood that ran from his nose and mouth as he died. Short-shackling, as described by survivors Pages later, in their formal conclusion, the Agency declares that there was no evidence of beating. There was no of evidence torture. The CIA ascribes responsibility for his death to hypothermia, which they blamed on him for the crime of refusing, on his final night, a meal from the men that killed him. The CIA claimed the complaints of a man they tortured to death \u2014 regarding the violation of his human rights \u2014 were evidence of a \u201csophisticated level of resistance training.\u201d In the aftermath, the Agency concealed the death of Gul Rahman from his family. To this day, they refuse to reveal what happened to his remains, denying those who survive him a burial, or even some locus of mourning. Ten years after the torture program investigated, exposed, and ended, no one was charged for their role in these crimes. The man responsible for Rahman\u2019s death was recommended for a $2,500 cash award \u2014 for \u201cconsistently superior work\u201d . A different torturer was elevated to the Director\u2019s seat . Subscribe now The Judgment of Solomon, Rubens, 1617 This summer, in a speech marking the occasion of the CIA's 75th birthday, President Biden struck a quite different note than he did in Philadelphia, reciting what the CIA instructs all presidents: that the soul of the institution really lies in speaking truth to power. \u201cWe turn to you with the big questions,\u201d Biden said, \u201cthe hardest questions.\u00a0And we count on you to give your best, unvarnished assessment of where we are.\u00a0 And I emphasize \u2018unvarnished.\u2019\u201d But this itself is a variety of varnishing \u2014 a whitewash. For what reason do we aspire to maintain \u2014 or achieve \u2014 a nation of laws, if not to establish justice? Let us say we have a democracy, shining and pure. The people, or in our case some subset of people, institute reasonable laws to which government and citizen alike must answer. The sense of justice that arises within such a society is not produced as a result of the mere presence of law, which can be tyrannical and capricious, or even elections, which face their own troubles, but is rather derived from the reason and fairness of the system that results. What would happen if we were to insert into this beautiful nation of laws an extralegal entity that is not directed by the people, but a person: the President? Have we protected the nation\u2019s security, or have we placed it at risk? This is the unvarnished truth: the establishment of an institution charged with breaking the law within a nation of laws has mortally wounded its founding precept. From the year it was established, Presidents and their cadres have regularly directed the CIA to go beyond the law for reasons that cannot be justified, and therefore must be concealed \u2014 classified . The primary result of the classification system is not an increase in national security, but a decrease in transparency. Without meaningful transparency, there is no accountability, and without accountability, there is no learning. Subscribe now The consequences have been deadly, for both Americans and our victims. When the CIA armed the Mujaheddin to wage war on Soviet Afghanistan, we created al-Qaeda\u2019s Osama bin Laden. Ten years later , the CIA is arming, according to then-Vice President Joe Biden, \"al-Nusra, and Al-Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.\" After the CIA runs a disinformation operation to make life hard for the Soviet Union by fueling a little proxy war, the war rages for twenty-six years \u2014 far beyond the Union\u2019s collapse . Do you believe that the CIA today \u2014 a CIA free from all consequence and accountability \u2014 is uninvolved in similar activities? Can you find no presence of their fingerprints in the events of the world, as described in the headlines, that provide cause for concern? Yet it is those who question the wisdom of placing a paramilitary organization beyond the reach of our courts that are dismissed as \u201cnaive.\u201d For 75 years, the American people have been unable to bend the CIA to fit the law, and so the law has been bent to fit the CIA. As Biden stood on the crimson stage, at the site where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were debated and adopted, his words rang out like the cry of a cracked-to-hell Liberty Bell: \u201cWhat's happening in our country is not normal.\u201d If only that were true.

        "full_content": "Executive Summary Britain's stagnation since 2008 represents not merely policy failure but a civilisational phase transition\u2014the release (\u03a9) and reorganisation (\u03b1) stages of a planetary-scale transformation in energy, economics, and governance. While the UK Foundations report correctly identifies planning paralysis and infrastructure deficits as binding constraints, it fundamentally misdiagnoses them as isolated bureaucratic failures rather than symptoms of a deeper metabolic shift in industrial civilisation's thermodynamic foundations. This analysis demonstrates that Britain's predicament is overdetermined by multiple reinforcing factors operating simultaneously. At the thermodynamic substrate lies the collapse of fossil fuel Energy Return on Investment from approximately thirty-five-to-one in the 1960s to below fifteen-to-one today\u2014meaning every barrel of oil now delivers progressively less surplus energy to society while extraction costs rise exponentially. This energetic contraction propagates through institutional rigidity traps, capital misallocation, and governance structures optimised for a growth regime that is fundamentally ending. The empirical evidence is stark. Labour productivity growth collapsed from nearly two percent annually in the pre-crisis decades to less than half a percent in the post-crisis era, while real wages for median workers remain below 2008 levels\u2014representing a lost generation of income growth unprecedented in modern British history. Capital markets have priced this metabolic slowdown with precision: British equities have dramatically underperformed international comparators, with legacy energy utilities losing the majority of their value despite rising consumer bills, while housebuilders extracted supernormal profits yet destroyed shareholder value through rent-seeking rather than productivity gains. The prescription is not restoration of exhausted paradigms through centralised megaprojects or fossil-nuclear infrastructure, but strategic reorganisation around distributed solar-wind-battery systems, regenerative design principles, and polycentric governance architectures. Britain faces a civilisational choice: attempt restoration of the thermodynamically impossible, or embrace the reorganisation phase that enables prosperity within planetary boundaries. The evidence presented here demonstrates that only the latter path is viable in an energy-descending world. I. The Misdiagnosis of Britain's Malaise In autumn 2024, an essay titled Foundations: Why Britain Has Stagnated ignited Westminster's most consequential economic debate in years. Co-authored by Sam Bowman, Ben Southwood, and Samuel Hughes\u2014three figures at the nexus of Britain's free-market policy ecosystem\u2014it rapidly became shorthand for the proposition that the nation's protracted slump results from an \"investment ban\" imposed by its own state apparatus, particularly the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act. The essay's reach was immediate and bipartisan. Cited by senior Conservatives and studied within Labour's Treasury team, Foundations offered a data-rich narrative to\u00a0explain Britain's sclerosis through a straightforward causal chain: bureaucratic planning restrictions prevented housing construction, infrastructure development, and energy investment, thereby throttling economic growth. The solution, it argued, was equally straightforward: streamline approvals, centralise decision-making, unleash private capital, and Britain could \"build again\" its way back to prosperity. Yet this conclusion that Britain merely needs to \"get building again\" fundamentally misreads the signal beneath the noise. What UK Foundations treats as evidence of political failure\u2014the paralysis, the cost overruns, the regulatory thicket\u2014are in reality symptoms of a deeper civilisational feedback process rooted in the intersection of energy, economics, and environment. These are the manifestations of an advanced industrial society moving through the back-loop of its own adaptive cycle: the turbulent phases of release (\u03a9) and reorganisation (\u03b1) that characterise planetary-scale transformation. The distinction matters profoundly. If Britain's stagnation were primarily a governance failure\u2014bad rules, timid ministers, obstructionist bureaucrats\u2014then the remedy would indeed be administrative: reform planning law, empower developers, override local objections. But if the stagnation reflects a systemic transition in the energy-economic metabolism of industrial civilisation itself, then attempted restoration of the old growth model becomes not just futile but actively destructive\u2014consuming the last reserves of surplus energy to build infrastructure that arrives too late and too expensive to function in the emerging post-carbon world. The Metabolic Slowdown in Economic Data The empirical reality paints a portrait of profound metabolic deceleration. Labour productivity growth\u2014the single most important determinant of living standards\u2014has essentially collapsed in the post-financial crisis era. Where Britain once achieved nearly two percent annual productivity growth in the decades before 2008, the post-crisis period has delivered barely one-fifth of that rate. Output per hour worked stands only marginally above pre-pandemic levels despite the economy having nominally recovered, representing glacial improvement that contrasts sharply with both historical norms and international comparators. Even more concerning is the behaviour of multi-factor productivity, which attempts to measure the true innovation and efficiency gains beyond mere accumulation of labour and capital. This measure has actually declined in recent years, meaning that despite rising educational attainment\u2014with degree-holders now comprising nearly two-fifths of the workforce compared to one-fifth two decades ago\u2014and despite employment expansion, the economy is generating proportionally less output from the same or greater inputs. This is the signature pattern of a catabolic system: one consuming its own organisational capacity rather than building new productive potential. Real wages tell an equally sobering story. For the median full-time worker, annual real wages today remain substantially below their 2008 peak, representing a sixteen-year period of effective income stagnation without parallel in modern British history. Average weekly wages have barely budged in real terms over this entire period. This represents not a temporary setback but a structural break\u2014a generation of workers for whom the\u00a0promise of rising living standards that characterised the post-war era has simply evaporated. Capital markets, often dismissed by policymakers as short-term and irrational, have in fact priced this metabolic slowdown with remarkable precision. British equities have dramatically underperformed international comparators over the past two decades, delivering real returns less than half those of American markets. A substantial investment in British equities versus American equivalents would have resulted in a wealth differential exceeding a quarter-million pounds\u2014not market volatility but systematic underperformance reflecting declining total factor productivity, capital misallocation, and the extraction of economic rents rather than creation of value. The pattern becomes clearer when examining specific sectors. Britain's largest housebuilders captured substantial market share and reported extraordinary profit margins year after year, yet their share prices have fallen dramatically in real terms over twenty-year periods despite these supernormal profits. The explanation lies in their business model: these firms generated returns not through productivity gains or innovation but via structural power\u2014withholding housing supply to maintain prices, extracting government subsidies, exploiting planning restrictions that created artificial scarcity. The planning system didn't block their profits; it enabled rent extraction. But this rent-seeking destroyed rather than created shareholder value over the long term, as volatility and political risk overwhelmed short-term gains. Energy utilities present an even starker picture. The parent company of British Gas lost three-quarters of its market value over the post-crisis period despite consumer energy bills rising substantially during the same timeframe. The Big Six energy companies collectively incurred interest expenses more than double their tax payments, while their effective borrowing costs substantially exceeded government rates\u2014indicating severe capital inefficiency and fundamental misalignment between their business models and the emerging energy transition. Companies structured for centralised fossil generation attempting to operate in a distributed renewable paradigm have seen asset write-downs, refinancing costs, and regulatory uncertainty systematically destroy shareholder value even as consumers pay more. Beyond Policy Failure to Systems Transition These are not isolated statistics amenable to policy fixes but manifestations of what the Planetary Phase Shift framework identifies as a systemic transition from fossil-fuelled expansion to post-carbon reorganisation. At the thermodynamic substrate of this transition lies a simple but inexorable reality: the Energy Return on Investment of fossil fuels has been declining for half a century. Where society once received thirty-five units of energy for every unit invested in extraction during the post-war boom, that ratio has now fallen below fifteen-to-one and continues its descent. This might sound like an abstraction, but its economic implications are concrete and pervasive. Every barrel of oil now delivers less surplus energy to society while requiring more energy for extraction, processing, and distribution. As this net energy declines, economies face a binding constraint: each additional unit of GDP requires proportionally more energy and material input to produce. The friction manifests as rising costs, declining productivity growth, mounting debt, and the proliferation of\u00a0bureaucratic complexity\u2014not because policymakers have become less competent but because the underlying thermodynamic foundation of industrial growth is eroding. This energetic contraction propagates through what the PPS framework terms Earth-System Disruption and Human-System Destabilisation feedbacks\u2014the twin engines of breakdown. Environmental stress from climate shocks and resource depletion drives social stress in the form of economic volatility and political polarisation, which in turn accelerates environmental damage, locking societies into vicious cycles. Britain's planning gridlock, fiscal exhaustion, and infrastructural sclerosis are not isolated bureaucratic failings but local expressions of this global back-loop dynamic. The UK Foundations narrative of \"banned investment\" conceals a deeper truth that the Planetary Phase Shift framework makes visible: when a civilisation's net energy declines, its ability to translate capital into real productivity falls\u2014even when money and labour are available in abundance. Britain's capital stock has actually contracted in recent years while other G7 economies saw substantial growth. The regulatory drag, planning inertia, and public opposition that UK Foundations decries are social expressions of this energy-information feedback\u2014a system under thermodynamic stress reflexively conserving stability as its energy throughput diminishes. In Holling's adaptive cycle framework, this is the conservation phase transitioning into release: a society that traded resilience for efficiency during the long growth phase now finds its optimised systems becoming brittle and maladaptive as the external energy environment shifts. The bureaucracy that appears as \"the blob\" is not an autonomous obstacle but an emergent property of this phase\u2014institutions designed for stable high-EROI conditions attempting to manage volatile low-EROI realities with increasingly inadequate tools. Britain is not a \"failed developer\" but a microcosm of the planetary back-loop: a society whose organisational software\u2014centralised planning, fossil-fuel finance, GDP growth imperatives\u2014no longer matches its material hardware. Every apparent malfunction in the UK Foundations inventory signals the same underlying transition. The only viable path forward lies not in attempting to restore the unrestorable but through \u03b1-phase reorganisation: building new systems designed for the energy and ecological realities of the twenty-first century rather than the twentieth. II. The Overdetermination of Stagnation While declining fossil fuel energy returns provide the thermodynamic substrate of Britain's crisis, the stagnation is what systems theorists term overdetermined\u2014multiple sufficient causes operate simultaneously, each reinforcing the others through complex feedback loops. Understanding this causal multiplicity is essential for policymakers, investors, and thought leaders, as it explains why simple interventions like planning reform or infrastructure spending alone cannot restore growth. The system's pathology is not linear but networked, and its resolution requires correspondingly systemic thinking. Institutional Rigidity and the Late-Phase Trap Britain exemplifies what Holling's adaptive cycle framework terms a late-K-phase rigidity trap: an over-optimised system that has progressively traded resilience for\u00a0efficiency until external shocks reveal its brittleness. During the fossil-fuelled front-loop of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Britain expanded its economic and institutional complexity on the foundation of cheap energy, imperial reach, and favourable demographics. This complexity served the nation well during growth phases, enabling sophisticated coordination, risk management, and resource allocation. But by the 1970s, as the energy surplus from North Sea oil began its inevitable decline and as the easy gains from post-war reconstruction exhausted themselves, each additional increment of infrastructure or policy coordination began delivering diminishing returns. The response across successive governments\u2014both Labour and Conservative\u2014followed the predictable pattern of conservation-phase systems: tightening fiscal controls, proliferating regulations, centralising decision-making, attempting to impose order on mounting disorder. These were not irrational choices but the reflexive behaviour of mature systems seeking to conserve stability as their energy throughput begins to contract. The result has been institutions that once enabled adaptation now obstruct it. Market sector growth has fallen to roughly one-third of its pre-crisis rate despite rising employment and educational attainment, indicating that the binding constraints are no longer labour quantity or human capital but the organisational and physical capital frameworks within which that labour operates. This represents not policy incompetence but a fundamental phase-mismatch: organisations optimised for the stable thermodynamics and abundant energy of the twentieth century attempting to operate in the volatile, declining-EROI conditions of the twenty-first. The 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, often vilified by UK Foundations as the original sin of British stagnation, emerges in this light as a symptom rather than a cause. It represented a conservation-phase response to perceived market failures in interwar development\u2014an attempt to impose rationality and order on what appeared as chaotic sprawl. That it has ossified into an obstacle reflects not the malice or incompetence of its designers but the inexorable tendency of institutions in the K-phase to accumulate complexity, resist change, and eventually become impediments to the very adaptation they were meant to enable. The Housing Paradox: Scarcity as Political Economy Britain's housing crisis presents a particularly stark illustration of how what appears as policy failure is actually political economy functioning as designed. With populations essentially identical in size, France possesses substantially more dwellings than Britain\u2014a deficit measured in millions of homes. London's metropolitan footprint has barely expanded since the 1930s while Paris's geographic extent has roughly tripled. This supply restriction creates profound spatial mismatch between where productivity is highest and where people can afford to live, throttling the agglomeration economies that drive modern economic growth. Yet this outcome is not an accident or bureaucratic oversight\u2014it is the intended consequence of a political economy in which the median voter benefits from housing supply restriction. With homeownership rates around two-thirds and housing wealth concentrated among older voters with higher turnout rates, the electoral incentives powerfully favour maintaining scarcity. The planning system that UK Foundations attacks as dysfunctional is actually performing its political function with brutal efficiency: implementing the preferences of the decisive electoral coalition. The economic consequences cascade through the system. Where Britain once saw millions migrate internally toward centres of rising productivity\u2014from agricultural regions to industrial cities in the nineteenth century, from declining industries to rising ones in the mid-twentieth\u2014such mobility has now frozen. Only the highest earners can afford to relocate to the most productive cities, while everyone else faces either extortionate housing costs or long-distance commuting that destroys quality of life. The result is trapped talent, constrained business expansion, and a self-reinforcing cycle where the most promising sectors cannot access the labour they need while workers cannot access the opportunities that exist. Cambridge exemplifies this dysfunction with crystalline clarity. As Britain's most dynamic biotech cluster, it faces binding physical constraints with minimal laboratory space vacant and Environment Agency blocking new housing due to water infrastructure limitations. Proposed major investments\u2014film studios, data centres\u2014have been rejected despite offering substantial economic benefits. The planning system isn't accidentally throttling Britain's most promising industries; it is systematically preventing the spatial reorganisation that economic transformation requires. The housebuilders themselves reveal the deeper pathology. Despite capturing substantial market share and reporting extraordinary profit margins sustained over years, their long-term shareholder returns are negative in real terms. This paradox\u2014supernormal profits coexisting with value destruction\u2014can only be explained by recognising that these firms extract rents rather than create value. They profit from scarcity itself, from government demand subsidies, from land banking, from exploiting the very planning restrictions that UK Foundations decries. When capitalism becomes about gaming regulatory constraints rather than productive innovation, the result is wealth transfer rather than wealth creation. Capital Deepening Collapse and the Energy Price Shock Beyond institutional rigidity and housing constraints lies a more fundamental problem: Britain has experienced a collapse in capital deepening\u2014the accumulation of machinery, equipment, and structures that amplify worker productivity. Gross fixed capital formation as a share of GDP lags substantially behind France and Germany, but the problem goes deeper than aggregate investment rates. The composition and efficiency of that investment has deteriorated markedly. Workers today are substantially better educated than two decades ago, with degree attainment nearly doubling, yet this human capital accumulation has not translated into commensurate productivity gains. The binding constraint is not worker quality but the physical and organisational capital they have to work with. Industrial electricity prices more than doubled in real terms between the mid-2000s and the Ukraine crisis, making energy-intensive manufacturing progressively unviable in Britain. Per-capita electricity generation is barely half that of France and less than two-fifths that of the United States\u2014closer to middle-income countries than to advanced economies. This energy deficit both reflects and reinforces broader capital allocation failures. Infrastructure costs have exploded due to centralisation destroying the cost discipline that once came from local or private financing bearing direct consequences. High-speed rail projects cost multiples per mile of equivalent Continental projects. Tram systems, where Britain builds them at all, cost several times French equivalents. The planning documentation for major projects has metastasised from hundreds of pages to hundreds of thousands, consuming hundreds of millions in process costs before construction even begins. The Edinburgh Tram project illuminates the mechanism: the phase funded primarily by central government experienced substantial cost overruns, while the phase financed locally against future revenues came in notably cheaper per mile. When financiers bear risk directly, they impose discipline\u2014consultations are bounded, design changes minimise, contractors face meaningful penalties. When costs diffuse across a vast national electorate, each project's waste remains \"invisibly small\" individually but aggregates to catastrophic bloat systemically. Yet even identifying these proximate causes\u2014institutional rigidity, housing constraints, capital deepening collapse, infrastructure cost disease\u2014does not fully explain Britain's stagnation. These are themselves symptoms of the deeper thermodynamic shift. As net energy available to society declines, systems naturally become more complex, coordination costs rise, conflicts over distribution intensify, and societies direct proportionally more effort toward managing internal frictions rather than generating new output. What appears as bureaucratic incompetence or political cowardice is often the visible surface of invisible thermodynamic constraints. III. The Energy Transition: Why Distributed Renewables Outperform Centralised Nuclear The UK Foundations prescription\u2014that Britain should reindustrialise through large-scale nuclear deployment\u2014exemplifies strategic thinking trapped in the previous era's paradigm. While nuclear technology retains legitimate niche applications, the centralised gigawatt-scale deployment model it advocates is economically, temporally, and thermodynamically misaligned with Britain's immediate needs and with the trajectory of the global energy transition. The Planetary Phase Shift framework reveals why attempting to restore fossil-nuclear infrastructure represents not pragmatic realism but thermodynamic denial. The Nuclear Thermodynamic Trap Modern nuclear power appears clean only at the electricity output level\u2014the point where electrons flow into the grid. But the Planetary Phase Shift framework demands scrutiny of full life-cycle energy returns, and here the picture darkens considerably. Once the complete supply chain is accounted for\u2014uranium mining in progressively lower-grade ores, isotope enrichment, fuel fabrication, the enormous concrete and steel requirements of plant construction, the long-term costs of decommissioning and waste management\u2014nuclear's effective Energy Return on Investment falls to levels comparable with mature oil fields, somewhere in the range of five-to-fifteen-to-one depending on methodology and assumptions. This might seem adequate in isolation, but the critical insight lies in the trajectory rather than the absolute level. As global fossil fuel EROI continues its inexorable decline, the energy cost of building nuclear infrastructure rises in tandem, because virtually every step in the nuclear supply chain remains dependent on fossil energy. Concrete production, steel fabrication, heavy transport, construction equipment\u2014all currently powered predominantly by coal, oil, and gas. The apparent paradox resolves into thermodynamic trap: building nuclear power to replace declining fossil fuels requires spending declining fossil energy to create infrastructure that barely exceeds the energy return of its inputs. From Holling's adaptive cycle perspective, nuclear expansion in current form represents the late-K-phase reflex: feeding remaining energy into rigid structures that can no longer evolve. Britain's own nuclear experience validates this concern with brutal empirical clarity. The newest reactors cost more than double per unit capacity what earlier generations achieved, with construction times stretching beyond a decade and financing costs now consuming the majority of total project expenditure. Hinkley Point C has absorbed tens of billions of pounds without producing a single electron, its completion perpetually receding into the future as costs escalate and timelines extend. The international pattern reinforces the diagnosis. Western nuclear projects systematically fail on cost and schedule\u2014France, Finland, and the United States have all experienced similar disasters\u2014while East Asian projects succeed primarily through conditions Britain cannot replicate: state financing eliminating risk premiums, regulatory stability preventing mid-construction rule changes, fleet construction enabling learning curves, domestic supply chains and skilled workforces built over decades of continuous deployment. Even South Korea's relatively successful model, when deployed in the UAE, produced costs still far above what renewables now achieve, and South Korea itself is now pivoting away from nuclear toward renewables in its domestic market. The Renewable Revolution: Exponential Learning Curves By contrast, solar-wind-battery technologies follow precisely the opposite trajectory, exhibiting the characteristics of the \u03b1-phase reorganisation: modular, distributed, adaptive, improving exponentially rather than degrading. According to authoritative sources like the International Renewable Energy Agency, global weighted average levelised costs of electricity from solar photovoltaics have fallen approximately ninety percent from 2010 to present. Onshore wind has fallen nearly seventy percent over the same period, while battery storage costs have collapsed more than ninety percent, approaching the threshold where grid-scale storage becomes economically transformative. These are not modest improvements but exponential learning curves driven by manufacturing scale, material science advances, and competition across multiple technology pathways simultaneously. Installed costs have declined comparably: solar systems that cost several dollars per watt a decade ago now install for a fraction of that, with wind showing similarly dramatic reductions. By 2024, more than ninety percent of newly commissioned utility-scale renewable capacity delivered power cheaper than the\u00a0cheapest new fossil alternative, helping avoid hundreds of billions in fossil fuel costs globally. The economic implications extend far beyond simple cost comparisons. The speed differential between technologies has become decisive in a volatile, energy-transitioning world. Nuclear projects require ten to fifteen years from final investment decision to first power, during which financing costs accumulate, technologies evolve, and political winds shift. Solar and wind projects deploy in months, battery storage in weeks to months. In an era where every year of delay amplifies exposure to fossil fuel price volatility, debt accumulation at rising interest rates, stranded-asset risk, and regulatory uncertainty, time-to-power has become the critical variable that orthodox energy analysis systematically underweights. A concrete comparison illustrates the divergence. Twenty billion pounds invested in a large nuclear project like Sizewell C would deliver zero operational capacity for more than a decade, during which it contributes nothing to emissions reduction, grid reliability, or energy security while consuming scarce capital and political attention. The same twenty billion distributed across solar, wind, and storage would deploy dozens of gigawatts becoming operational within years, delivering immediate emissions reductions, enhancing grid resilience through diversity, and creating the foundation for the next wave of innovation. The RethinkX Superpower Model: Abundance Economics The most radical insight from cutting-edge energy systems analysis emerges from RethinkX's modeling of what they term \"Clean Energy Superpower\"\u2014the counterintuitive discovery that deliberately overbuilding renewable generation and storage actually reduces total system costs while unlocking transformative economic possibilities. By deploying solar and wind capacity several times greater than average demand and pairing it with substantial but not unlimited storage, the system generates vast quantities of near-zero marginal cost electricity during high-production periods. This \"superpower\"\u2014surplus electricity available at production costs approaching zero\u2014becomes the foundation for an entirely new energy economy. Green hydrogen production for heavy industry, steel, chemicals, and aviation fuel becomes economically viable when electricity is essentially free. Desalination to address water scarcity, carbon capture powered by surplus rather than displacing needed generation, industrial process heat, data centre operations\u2014all become possible at scales that seemed economically absurd when conceived in the fossil-nuclear paradigm of expensive, scarce energy. Germany's energy transition, despite its challenges and setbacks, offers glimpses of this potential. Periods of renewable overproduction now regularly drive wholesale electricity prices negative\u2014a signal not of failure but of the transformation from scarcity economics to abundance economics. With adequate storage and intelligent demand management, these periods of \"waste\" become opportunities for economic activities that were previously unthinkable. The circular energy economy emerges where surplus electricity powers processes that enable material circularity, closing loops that remained open when energy was scarce and expensive. The governance implications mirror the technical architecture. If the energy transition is to function as genuine \u03b1-phase transformation rather than merely substituting renewable for fossil inputs within unchanged power structures, its political architecture must embody distributed intelligence. RethinkX's concept of an \"Energy Bill of Rights\"\u2014guaranteeing citizens and communities the right to generate, store, and trade electricity within technical safety parameters\u2014represents not utopian idealism but recognition that resilience in complex adaptive systems comes from diversity, redundancy, and distributed agency rather than centralised control. Britain's challenge, then, is not choosing between nuclear and renewables as competing technologies but recognising they represent competing paradigms: centralised versus distributed, rigid versus adaptive, declining versus improving cost curves, decade-scale versus month-scale deployment, fossil-supply-chain-dependent versus increasingly autonomous. The choice Britain faces is whether to channel its limited capital and political will into attempting restoration of a high-cost centralised paradigm increasingly misaligned with thermodynamic and economic reality, or into accelerating the reorganisation around low-cost distributed systems where capital efficiency improves exponentially with each iteration. IV. Market Signals: Capital Pricing the Impossible While policymakers debate theoretical frameworks and economists construct elaborate models, capital markets\u2014that supposedly irrational, short-term, casino-like institution of modern capitalism\u2014have been pricing Britain's metabolic slowdown with remarkable precision and consistency. The systematic divergence between official narratives of recovery and actual investor returns reveals a fundamental disconnect between political economy and thermodynamic reality that thought leaders and institutional investors would be imprudent to ignore. The Equity Market's Verdict British equities have delivered real returns less than half those of American markets over the past two decades\u2014a differential so substantial and sustained that it cannot be dismissed as temporary volatility or sector rotation. This represents systematic underperformance reflecting the declining total factor productivity, capital misallocation, and rent extraction that characterise Britain's economic model. An investor who placed substantial capital in British versus American equities would face a wealth differential exceeding a quarter-million pounds on a modest six-figure investment\u2014not because of poor stock-picking but because of systematic dysfunction in the underlying economy. More revealing than aggregate indices are the sector-specific patterns that illuminate precisely where value is being created versus destroyed. Britain's largest housebuilders present a particularly instructive case study in how regulatory-induced scarcity creates rent-seeking rather than productivity. These firms captured substantial market share and reported extraordinary profit margins sustained across years, yet their long-term shareholder returns are dramatically negative in real terms. Share prices that peaked before the financial crisis remain substantially below those levels two decades later despite intervening profits measured in billions. The paradox resolves when recognising the business model: these firms generated returns not through innovation or productivity gains but via structural power\u2014withholding supply to maintain prices, extracting government subsidies that at times accounted for nearly half their sales, renegotiating development obligations with local authorities, exploiting limited competition in land markets. The planning system didn't block their profitability; it enabled rent extraction. But rent-seeking without value creation ultimately destroys rather than preserves capital, as sector volatility and political risk overwhelm short-term gains. This is capitalism failing at its fundamental purpose: allocating capital to productive rather than extractive uses. The energy sector reveals even more acute value destruction. Centrica, once a FTSE 100 constituent, lost three-quarters of its market value despite consumer energy bills rising substantially over the same period. The disconnect between rising prices and collapsing equity value reflects fundamental misalignment: companies structured for centralised fossil generation attempting to operate in an emerging distributed renewable paradigm experience asset write-downs, refinancing costs, and regulatory uncertainty that systematically destroy shareholder value even as consumers pay more. The incumbent utilities are trapped in a declining business model, their substantial physical assets becoming stranded capital as the energy transition accelerates. Conversely, global renewable energy leaders demonstrate the opposite trajectory. Though most pure-plays trade on foreign exchanges due to Britain's market structure bias toward oil majors and legacy utilities, their performance signals where capital is migrating. Companies operating substantial renewable portfolios have delivered sustained outperformance versus fossil incumbents, indicating that markets understand\u2014even if policymakers remain in denial\u2014that the energy transition is not coming but here, and that betting against exponential learning curves in favour of declining ones destroys rather than preserves wealth. Infrastructure as Capital Destruction Major British infrastructure projects have become case studies in how process worship and misaligned incentives destroy rather than create capital value. High-speed rail costs multiples per mile of equivalent Continental projects. Planning documentation for major schemes has metastasised from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of pages, consuming hundreds of millions in process costs before construction begins\u2014in some cases exceeding the cost of actually building equivalent infrastructure elsewhere. Nuclear plants absorb tens of billions while producing zero electricity, their completion dates perpetually receding as costs escalate. The economic consequence of every billion pounds in cost overrun or delay is profound. Infrastructure projects typically generate economic multipliers, meaning foregone or delayed projects represent multiples of their direct cost in lost economic activity. The opportunity cost compounds: capital consumed by dysfunctional megaprojects could have deployed distributed renewable capacity at several times the scale, operational within years rather than decades. At prevailing interest rates, every billion pounds of wasted capital requires tens of millions annually in perpetual debt service\u2014a permanent claim on future productivity that delivers nothing in return. Yet beneath these proximate failures lies a deeper pattern that the Planetary Phase Shift framework illuminates. Infrastructure costs are exploding not because engineers have become incompetent or because contractors have become corrupt\u2014though both phenomena exist\u2014but because societies in the back-loop of their adaptive cycle direct proportionally more energy toward managing internal complexity rather than generating new output. The planning documents that consume hundreds of millions represent attempts to achieve legal defensibility in an increasingly litigious environment, transfer risk from decision-makers to consultants, provide political cover through \"exhaustive process,\" and enable objectors to achieve de facto veto through process exhaustion. This is not bureaucracy failing to make decisions\u2014obstruction has become the decision. When net energy declines and political consensus fragments, bureaucratic complexity becomes a socially acceptable mechanism for saying \"no\" to change while preserving the appearance of rationality and deliberation. The system is not broken; it is functioning precisely as the political economy requires, implementing the preferences of the decisive electoral coalition while diffusing responsibility across enough actors that no one can be held individually accountable for collective failure. The verdict from capital markets, then, is unambiguous: legacy fossil-nuclear utilities face progressive value destruction as the energy transition accelerates; housebuilders extract rents without creating value through regulatory arbitrage; infrastructure megaprojects systematically destroy returns through misaligned incentives and process pathology; distributed renewable systems exhibit exponential cost improvement and deployment acceleration; global clean energy leaders sustain dramatic outperformance versus fossil incumbents. British policymakers and institutional investors face a choice: continue subsidising value-destroying incumbents through contracts, capacity markets, and demand subsidies, or accelerate transition toward distributed systems where capital efficiency improves exponentially with each deployment cycle. Markets have already made their judgment. The question is whether policy will follow thermodynamic reality or persist in fighting it until the last reserves of capital and credibility exhaust themselves in futile attempts to restore what cannot be restored. V. The Reorganisation Imperative: From Restoration to Renewal Britain's path forward requires not merely \"building more\" infrastructure or \"getting out of the way\" of private investment\u2014the stale dichotomy that dominates policy debate\u2014but fundamental reconfiguration of institutional, financial, and governance structures around the emergent realities of post-carbon civilisation. The Planetary Phase Shift framework identifies this as the \u03b1-phase: the reorganisation stage where adaptive capacity can grow faster than entropy accumulates, but only if social systems align themselves with rather than against thermodynamic and ecological constraints. This is not about managing decline but about building differently for a fundamentally different energy and information metabolism. Energy System Redesign: The Path to Distributed Abundance The reorganisation of Britain's energy system must begin from recognition that the goal is not merely decarbonisation\u2014replacing fossil inputs with low-carbon alternatives within essentially unchanged system architecture\u2014but transformation toward\u00a0fundamentally different energy economics. The distributed solar-wind-battery paradigm offers not just lower emissions but lower costs, faster deployment, greater resilience, and the foundation for economic activities that remain unviable in the scarcity economics of fossil-nuclear systems. The strategic priority is deployment at scale of renewable generation deliberately overbuilt relative to average demand, paired with storage systems operating across multiple timescales. This appears economically irrational within conventional energy economics\u2014why build capacity that sits idle much of the time?\u2014but becomes transformative when recognising that the marginal cost of renewable electricity approaches zero and that storage costs continue their exponential decline. The result is a system that cuts total costs dramatically while generating vast quantities of \"superpower\"\u2014surplus electricity at near-zero cost enabling entirely new industrial processes and economic sectors. This transition requires more than technology deployment; it demands institutional innovation to match the distributed architecture of the energy system itself. Guaranteeing citizens and communities the right to generate, store, and trade electricity within technical safety parameters converts passive consumers into active producers of resilience, spreading both agency and risk across the system rather than concentrating it in centralised utilities vulnerable to single points of failure. The political architecture must mirror the technical form: moving from control hierarchies to coordination networks, from centralised planning to polycentric experimentation within broad ecological constraints. Grid infrastructure modernises not to connect remote centralised generation to distant consumption but to enable power flow in all directions, balancing surplus and scarcity across regions and timescales through intelligent orchestration rather than rigid scheduling. Storage deploys in cascade: batteries for seconds-to-hours balancing, pumped hydro for hours-to-days, hydrogen for seasonal storage enabling weeks without wind or sun, vehicle-to-grid from millions of electric vehicles providing massive distributed buffering. Demand becomes flexible through price signals and automation, with industrial processes, building systems, and transport infrastructure absorbing surplus when available and shedding load when scarce. The transformation unlocks economic possibilities that remain marginal or impossible in fossil-nuclear paradigm. Green hydrogen production for steelmaking, chemicals, and aviation becomes viable when electricity is nearly free during high renewable output. Desalination powered by surplus renewables addresses water constraints that currently block urban and industrial expansion. Data centres\u2014energy-intensive but economically vital\u2014become demand response assets rather than rigid base-load consumers, absorbing superpower when available while load-shifting when constrained. Industrial process heat, currently dependent on natural gas, transitions to resistance heating and heat pumps powered by abundant clean electricity. Spatial Reorganisation: Cities as Adaptive Networks Housing and transport policy must follow parallel logic: not restoring twentieth-century patterns of sprawl, automobile dependence, and energy-intensive suburban expansion, but building for the \u03b1-phase city\u2014dense, modular, electrified, functioning as networks\u00a0of distributed generation and shared mobility rather than hierarchical systems of centralised provision and atomised consumption. The strategic priority in housing is retrofit rather than greenfield expansion. Britain's housing stock is the oldest in Europe, with a substantial proportion predating modern insulation and heating standards. Space heating alone accounts for the majority of residential energy consumption. Systematic deployment of heat pumps combined with building envelope improvements could reduce heating demand by more than half while eliminating dependence on natural gas entirely. The per-dwelling cost appears substantial in isolation but becomes transformative at scale: lower than many proposed infrastructure megaprojects while delivering greater economic and carbon benefits, creating domestic employment in installation and manufacturing, improving energy security, reducing fuel poverty, and enhancing housing asset values. New housing construction must escape the trap of reproducing automobile-dependent suburban forms that lock in energy consumption patterns for decades. Development corporations with genuine land assembly powers and self-financing through value capture can deliver mixed-use, transit-oriented development at density levels that support walking, cycling, and public transport as default rather than aspirational modes. This is not aesthetic preference but thermodynamic necessity: distributed renewable systems work best at scales where generation, storage, and consumption can be locally balanced, requiring urban forms that concentrate activity while maintaining human scale and ecological integration. Transport transformation follows naturally from spatial reorganisation. Active travel infrastructure\u2014protected cycling routes, pedestrian-priority streets, e-bike networks\u2014can shift substantial modal share at modest cost compared to major transit projects, delivering immediate health benefits through increased physical activity while reducing road congestion and air pollution. Electrified public transport\u2014bus networks with frequent service and affordable fares, metro and tram systems in larger cities\u2014expands labour market access more effectively than road capacity additions, increasing effective city size without corresponding land consumption. The critical insight is that spatial form determines energy consumption and mobility patterns for decades or generations once established. Building compact, mixed-use, transit-oriented development now creates the conditions for low-energy, high-amenity urban living in perpetuity. Building automobile-dependent sprawl locks in opposite outcomes. The choice Britain makes in the coming decade will determine whether cities become assets or liabilities in the energy transition. Governance Architecture: From Control to Coordination The planning and governance reforms Britain needs are not those imagined by UK Foundations\u2014centralising power in Treasury to override objections and \"get things built\"\u2014but rather radical decentralisation that aligns decision-making authority with both responsibility for outcomes and capacity for local adaptation. The late-industrial state has become an information bottleneck: decisions trapped in hierarchies while environmental and economic conditions change faster than bureaucracies can process. The solution lies in polycentric governance architectures where city-regions possess genuine autonomy over infrastructure investment, financing it through own-source revenues and borrowing against future tax yields. This creates the cost discipline that centralised funding systematically destroys: when local financiers bear risk directly, they impose limits on gold-plating, constrain design changes, manage contractors effectively, and complete projects on time and budget. The evidence is overwhelming\u2014from historical private infrastructure delivery in Britain to contemporary French metro systems to the dramatic cost differentials between centrally and locally financed infrastructure in modern Britain. Regulatory consolidation must replace the current archipelago of agencies\u2014energy, water, transport, environment\u2014each with separate mandates, timelines, and approval processes. A single infrastructure consenting authority operating under clear statutory timescales and expedited judicial review processes can dramatically reduce approval times while maintaining environmental protection and public consultation. The key is shifting from discretionary to rules-based systems: if proposals meet published technical standards, approval becomes administrative rather than political, eliminating the de facto veto power that enables indefinite delay through process exhaustion. Development rights, currently parceled out through opaque negotiations and subject to arbitrary political interference, should follow clear form-based codes specifying height, setback, use intensity, and design standards. Projects meeting these codes proceed without discretionary approval; those exceeding them face transparent criteria for variance. This shifts planning from negotiation\u2014where local objectors have asymmetric power and developers capture rents through political connections\u2014to rule of law where outcomes are predictable and capital can be efficiently allocated. The meta-principle is moving from control to coordination: central government sets outcomes\u2014carbon budgets, housing targets, service standards\u2014but not methods. Multiple jurisdictions experiment with different approaches, creating comparative information about what works. Failures remain local rather than systemic, while successes can be rapidly emulated. This is how complex adaptive systems generate innovation and resilience: through diversity, redundancy, and parallel experimentation rather than optimised central planning. Economic Restructuring: From Rents to Returns Britain's financial architecture must redirect capital from rent extraction to productive investment, from speculation on artificial scarcity to genuine innovation and efficiency improvement. The current system produces perverse outcomes: bank lending concentrates overwhelmingly on residential property, equity markets tilt toward oil majors and legacy utilities with minimal renewable exposure, venture capital targets consumer technology offering quick exits rather than patient capital for deep technology requiring longer gestation. The first priority is pension fund reform enabling patient capital for infrastructure and industrial transition. British pension assets measured in trillions currently invest minimally in domestic productive capacity, preferring liquid international equities despite their underperformance. Modest mandatory allocations to British infrastructure\u2014renewable energy projects, retrofit programmes, transport systems,\u00a0circular economy supply chains\u2014would unlock capital orders of magnitude larger than government can mobilise while providing stable inflation-protected returns appropriate for pension liabilities. Regional development banking following German Sparkassen models can redirect credit to productive rather than speculative uses. Local institutions with statutory lending targets to regional small and medium enterprises, strict limits on property speculation, and public-benefit governance reinvesting profits in community infrastructure create alternative circuits of capital accumulation outside the London-dominated financial monoculture. This is not economic nationalism but recognition that financial systems optimised for global capital allocation systematically under-serve local productive capacity. The meta-objective is shifting from wealth preservation through asset appreciation to wealth creation through productivity improvement. The former extracts rents from artificial scarcity; the latter generates genuine surplus through innovation and efficiency. An economy where most bank lending finances residential property purchases, where housebuilders profit from withholding supply, where utilities extract value through regulatory arbitrage rather than operational excellence\u2014this is capitalism failing at its fundamental purpose. Reorganisation means reconstructing financial circuits that reward productivity over rent-seeking, long-term investment over short-term speculation, distributed resilience over concentrated extraction. VI. Beyond Growth: Prosperity Within Boundaries The Planetary Phase Shift framework's most radical implication is that \"growth\" as conventionally measured\u2014expansion of material throughput, energy consumption, and GDP\u2014may be neither achievable nor desirable in an energy-descending, ecologically-bounded world. This does not portend stagnation or decline in human welfare but rather redefinition of prosperity around metrics that improve with falling material intensity: the energy and information efficiency of well-being. The Obsolescence of GDP Gross Domestic Product measures economic activity regardless of whether that activity enhances or degrades welfare. Healthcare spending rises as populations sicken, yet GDP treats this as growth rather than loss. Rebuilding after floods registers as economic activity rather than disaster. Financial services that allocate capital to property speculation rather than productive investment inflate GDP while hollowing out the real economy. Unpaid care work that sustains families and communities remains uncounted, while ecological degradation that depletes natural capital goes unrecognised until catastrophic thresholds breach. The divergence between GDP and welfare has widened dramatically in the post-crisis era. GDP per capita grew marginally while median real wages fell substantially. Life expectancy stalled for the first time outside wartime in modern history. Mental health crises intensified with millions waiting for treatment compared to far fewer a decade prior. Ecological footprints expanded despite emissions falling domestically through offshoring production to countries with dirtier energy. More economic activity generated\u00a0less human flourishing\u2014the signature of a system optimised for throughput rather than outcomes. The Planetary Phase Shift framework proposes measuring prosperity through energy and information efficiency of well-being: the quality of life outcomes achieved per unit of energy and material consumed, and the speed at which societies adapt to changing conditions. Health-adjusted life expectancy per unit energy consumption captures how efficiently societies transform energy into human thriving. Countries like Costa Rica and Cuba achieve outcomes approaching Britain's with dramatically lower energy footprints, demonstrating that high welfare and low consumption can coexist with appropriate system design. Shelter sufficiency per unit material input measures how effectively housing systems provide security, comfort, and community with minimal resource extraction. Modular construction, circular material flows, retrofit over new-build, shared facilities\u2014these approaches can dramatically reduce material intensity while maintaining or improving housing quality. Access to opportunity per unit transport energy captures how urban form and mobility systems connect people to jobs, services, and social networks\u2014active travel and efficient public transport enabling rich urban life with minimal energy compared to automobile dependence. The Circular Economy as Growth Successor In a material-constrained, energy-transitioning economy, wealth creation must shift from extraction to circulation. Britain currently consumes hundreds of millions of tonnes of material annually, of which only a small fraction circulates through reuse and recycling while the rest becomes waste. The circular economy potential is vast: construction alone could generate tens of billions in value through design for disassembly, material passports, and component standardisation. Electronics and textiles offer comparable opportunities through right-to-repair, deposit-return schemes, and service models replacing ownership. The employment implications are substantial and progressive. Circular economy activities are inherently labour-intensive compared to virgin extraction, creating hundreds of thousands of net jobs concentrated in maintenance, remanufacturing, and local service provision rather than capital-intensive resource extraction. These jobs are geographically distributed rather than concentrated in declining industrial regions or global commodity extraction zones, providing economic opportunity in the very communities suffering from deindustrialisation. The carbon implications are equally profound. Material production accounts for substantial emissions\u2014concrete, steel, plastics, chemicals. Reducing virgin material consumption while maintaining or improving services through circular flows can eliminate tens of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, equivalent to substantial fractions of current emissions from transport or heating. This is decarbonisation through dematerialisation rather than through fuel-switching alone. The Doughnut Framework: Social Foundation and Ecological Ceiling Kate Raworth's Doughnut Economics provides operational framework for reorganisation: ensuring all people meet social foundation\u2014health, education,\u00a0housing, meaningful participation\u2014while remaining within ecological ceiling defined by climate stability, biodiversity integrity, and resource regeneration rates. Britain currently fails on both dimensions: millions live in unaffordable or insecure housing, relative poverty affects substantial populations, health outcomes deteriorate, political disengagement intensifies. Simultaneously, carbon footprints exceed sustainable levels by multiples, biodiversity intactness ranks near global bottom, material consumption far exceeds what ecosystems can regenerate. The reorganisation pathway thus has dual imperatives: lifting the floor to ensure universal access to foundations of dignified life, while lowering the ceiling to operate within planetary boundaries. These are not competing objectives but complementary: the systems that generate present inequality are also those driving ecological overshoot. Distributed renewable energy, circular material flows, compact urban form, public transport, preventative healthcare, education\u2014these enhance both equity and sustainability simultaneously. The political feasibility question becomes whether transformation is possible given entrenched interests and electoral pressures. The answer is that business-as-usual is thermodynamically impossible. Continuation along current trajectories leads inexorably to fiscal collapse as debt service consumes all discretionary spending, social breakdown as generational wealth gaps exceed tolerance, and ecological overshoot triggering cascading system failures. The choice is not transformation versus stability but managed transition versus chaotic collapse. VII. Conclusion: The Civilisational Choice Britain's crisis is not that it has forgotten how to build but that it has been building the wrong things for the wrong system. The UK Foundations narrative confines analysis inside a shrinking loop of cause and effect\u2014bureaucrats block investment, therefore remove bureaucrats\u2014while missing the deeper pattern: the exhaustion of a civilisational operating system whose energy foundations, institutional assumptions, and growth imperatives belong to a geological age that is ending. Evidence of Metabolic Transition The evidence synthesised across this analysis demonstrates systematic metabolic slowdown across every domain. Economic indicators show productivity growth collapsed to fractions of historical rates, real wages stagnant across a generation, capital stock contracting while peer economies expand. Market signals reveal equity underperformance exceeding hundreds of thousands of pounds on modest investments, housebuilders destroying shareholder value through rent extraction despite supernormal profits, energy utilities losing three-quarters of value despite rising consumer bills, while global renewable leaders outperform fossil incumbents by multiples. Public finance has deteriorated from manageable deficit to structural trap where debt service consumes resources equivalent to major government departments while delivering nothing productive. Energy systems are misaligned with transition needs: per-capita electricity generation is fractions of peer economies, industrial costs doubled driving manufacturing exodus, nuclear costs escalated dramatically while renewable\u00a0costs collapsed exponentially, time-to-power stretches to decades for centralised systems while distributed alternatives deploy in months. Political economy has frozen into rigidity trap where two-thirds homeownership creates median voter benefiting from supply restriction, trillions in housing wealth depend on continued scarcity, planning systems implement rather than defy these preferences, and discourse about bureaucratic \"blobs\" obscures intergenerational wealth transfers that constitute the greatest redistribution in British history\u2014from young to old, from productive to rent-seeking, from future to present. The Pathway to Reorganisation Escaping this trap requires not crusade against bureaucracy or nostalgic restoration of nuclear-fossil infrastructure but deliberate pivot toward reorganisation around post-carbon realities. Energy abundance through distributed solar-wind-battery systems deployed at scale with deliberate over-build to generate superpower enabling industrial revival, green hydrogen production, desalination, carbon management\u2014electricity at near-zero marginal cost transforming economic possibilities. Spatial reorganisation rebuilding cities as adaptive networks: systematic retrofit of existing housing stock reducing heating demand by more than half while eliminating gas dependency; new development at densities supporting active travel and public transport as default modes; electrified mobility networks expanding labour market access without corresponding road capacity or land consumption. Governance transformation from control hierarchies to coordination networks: radical devolution to city-regions with financing through own-source revenues creating cost discipline; regulatory consolidation replacing agency archipelagos; form-based codes replacing discretionary permissions. Economic restructuring redirecting capital from rent extraction to productive investment: pension fund deployment to patient capital for infrastructure and industrial transition; regional development banking serving local productive capacity rather than property speculation; financial circuits rewarding productivity improvement over asset appreciation. Social foundation met through housing supply surge, energy cost reduction, preventative health investment, educational access\u2014while ecological ceiling approached through carbon reduction, circular economy expansion, biodiversity restoration, resource footprint contraction. The Decisive Window The coming decade is decisive for thermodynamic, technological, and political reasons operating simultaneously. Thermodynamically, fossil fuel energy returns continue declining; delaying energy transition infrastructure buildout means attempting construction as energy surplus contracts further, making each additional year exponentially more difficult. Technologically, renewable learning curves are accelerating currently; delay means losing manufacturing capacity and expertise to nations that move decisively while costs rise domestically as global deployment outpaces British participation. Politically, demographic transition sees millennials becoming median voters within this decade; this cohort is substantially less likely to own homes and thus potentially\u00a0receptive to pro-building politics\u2014but if locked out of housing until middle age, historical patterns suggest authoritarian rather than progressive political responses. If Britain acts decisively now, it catches exponential cost declines, builds during demographic window of opportunity, and establishes reorganisation template demonstrating to other nations that prosperity within planetary boundaries is achievable. If Britain delays further, it misses technology cost curves, faces hostile political economy as homeowner electoral dominance peaks, and watches others capture reorganisation advantages. Restoration Versus Reorganisation UK Foundations offers restoration: remove planning barriers, build nuclear and high-speed rail at scale, restore growth trajectories from decades past. This appeals because it is familiar\u2014Britain knows how to do large infrastructure projects, or believes it does, and restoration promises return to comfortable certainty of post-war expansion. But restoration is thermodynamically impossible. The fossil-powered growth regime is ending whether Britain wills it or not. Attempting to rebuild twentieth-century infrastructure at twenty-first-century scale while net energy declines produces the catabolic trap: consuming remaining surplus energy to create assets that arrive too late, cost too much, and function poorly in the emerging post-carbon world. This is not pessimism but thermodynamic realism. Planetary Phase Shift offers reorganisation: building new energy metabolism around ambient flows rather than stored deposits, new spatial forms optimising for resilience rather than throughput, new governance structures enabling adaptation rather than control, new prosperity metrics valuing well-being efficiency rather than material accumulation. This is unfamiliar and uncertain\u2014we are inventing it as we proceed, learning through experimentation, accepting that some efforts will fail while others succeed. But reorganisation is thermodynamically aligned. It works with declining fossil energy returns by shifting to renewable energy harvesting that improves rather than degrades over time. It builds adaptive capacity through diversity and modularity rather than brittle efficiency through centralisation. It creates prosperity within rather than beyond planetary boundaries by measuring success through outcome efficiency rather than throughput expansion. From Fear to Mastery The defining psychological shift of the Planetary Phase Shift is from fear of limits to mastery of feedbacks. Civilisations collapse when they treat boundaries as obstacles to overcome through force; they renew when they use boundaries as signals for optimisation, guides for elegant adaptation, opportunities for innovation within constraints rather than despite them. Britain pioneered the industrial age by mastering coal energy\u2014not by discovering it first but by developing the social, technical, and financial systems to deploy it at scale. It can pioneer the regenerative age by mastering solar abundance\u2014not through technological breakthrough alone but through systemic integration of distributed\u00a0generation, circular materials, adaptive governance, and prosperity redefined around well-being rather than throughput. The data already illuminate the path: exponential learning curves in renewables, falling costs, rising energy returns, deployment acceleration. But data alone are insufficient. Britain must update its organising story from mastery over nature to partnership with it, from growth against limits to growth through feedback, from extraction to regeneration, from accumulation to circulation, from throughput speed to coherence depth. This is not naive utopianism but thermodynamic realism. The fossil age is ending. The question is whether Britain navigates the transition deliberately, building the regenerative civilisation that can succeed within planetary boundaries, or whether it exhausts its remaining energy and capital attempting futile restoration until chaotic collapse forces reorganisation under catastrophic rather than managed conditions. Every back-loop is a test of consciousness. Either we expend the last surplus defending the old order\u2014megaprojects that destroy capital, fossil subsidies that accelerate decline, bureaucratic hierarchies that obstruct adaptation\u2014or we channel remaining resources into building the architecture of renewal: distributed energy abundance, adaptive urban form, polycentric governance, regenerative economics. Britain faces a civilisational choice. The evidence presented here demonstrates that restoration is thermodynamically impossible while reorganisation is economically viable. The only remaining question is whether the political will exists to choose the thermodynamically possible over the nostalgically desired, to build for the civilisation that can succeed rather than attempting to resurrect the one that cannot. History casts Britain in this role before. The challenge now is not to rebuild the industrial civilisation it launched but to build the regenerative civilisation that will succeed it\u2014one measuring success not by material throughput but by the coherence between people, technology, and the living Earth. That is how Britain escapes stagnation: not by tightening the old machine but by learning to evolve. References Ahmed, N. (2017).

The Misdiagnosis of Britain&apos;s Malaise</strong></h2><p>In autumn 2024, an essay titled&#xa0;<a href=\"https://ukfoundations.co/?ref=ageoftransformation.org\"><em><u>Foundations: Why Britain Has Stagnated</u></em></a>&#xa0;ignited Westminster&apos;s most consequential economic debate in years. Co-authored by Sam Bowman, Ben Southwood, and Samuel Hughes&#x2014;three figures at the nexus of Britain&apos;s free-market policy ecosystem&#x2014;it rapidly became shorthand for the proposition that the nation&apos;s protracted slump results from an &quot;investment ban&quot; imposed by its own state apparatus, particularly the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act.</p><p>The essay&apos;s reach was immediate and bipartisan. Cited by senior Conservatives and studied within Labour&apos;s Treasury team,&#xa0;<em>Foundations</em>&#xa0;offered a data-rich narrative to&#xa0;explain Britain&apos;s sclerosis through a straightforward causal chain: bureaucratic planning restrictions prevented housing construction, infrastructure development, and energy investment, thereby throttling economic growth. The solution, it argued, was equally straightforward: streamline approvals, centralise decision-making, unleash private capital, and Britain could &quot;build again&quot; its way back to prosperity.</p><p>Yet this conclusion that Britain merely needs to &quot;get building again&quot; fundamentally misreads the signal beneath the noise. What&#xa0;<em>UK Foundations</em>&#xa0;treats as evidence of political failure&#x2014;the paralysis, the cost overruns, the regulatory thicket&#x2014;are in reality symptoms of a deeper civilisational feedback process rooted in the intersection of energy, economics, and environment. These are the manifestations of an advanced industrial society moving through the back-loop of its own adaptive cycle: the turbulent phases of&#xa0;<em>release</em>&#xa0;(&#x3a9;) and&#xa0;<em>reorganisation</em>&#xa0;(&#x3b1;) that characterise planetary-scale transformation.</p><p>The distinction matters profoundly. If Britain&apos;s stagnation were primarily a governance failure&#x2014;bad rules, timid ministers, obstructionist bureaucrats&#x2014;then the remedy would indeed be administrative: reform planning law, empower developers, override local objections. But if the stagnation reflects a systemic transition in the energy-economic metabolism of industrial civilisation itself, then attempted restoration of the old growth model becomes not just futile but actively destructive&#x2014;consuming the last reserves of surplus energy to build infrastructure that arrives too late and too expensive to function in the emerging post-carbon world.</p><h3 id=\"the-metabolic-slowdown-in-economic-data\"><strong>The Metabolic Slowdown in Economic Data</strong></h3><p>The empirical reality paints a portrait of profound metabolic deceleration. Labour productivity growth&#x2014;the single most important determinant of living standards&#x2014;has essentially collapsed in the post-financial crisis era. Where Britain once achieved nearly two percent annual productivity growth in the decades before 2008, the post-crisis period has delivered barely one-fifth of that rate. Output per hour worked stands only marginally above pre-pandemic levels despite the economy having nominally recovered, representing glacial improvement that contrasts sharply with both historical norms and international comparators.</p><p>Even more concerning is the behaviour of multi-factor productivity, which attempts to measure the true innovation and efficiency gains beyond mere accumulation of labour and capital. This measure has actually declined in recent years, meaning that despite rising educational attainment&#x2014;with degree-holders now comprising nearly two-fifths of the workforce compared to one-fifth two decades ago&#x2014;and despite employment expansion, the economy is generating proportionally less output from the same or greater inputs. This is the signature pattern of a catabolic system: one consuming its own organisational capacity rather than building new productive potential.</p><p>Real wages tell an equally sobering story. For the median full-time worker, annual real wages today remain substantially below their 2008 peak, representing a sixteen-year period of effective income stagnation without parallel in modern British history. Average weekly wages have barely budged in real terms over this entire period. This represents not a temporary setback but a structural break&#x2014;a generation of workers for whom the&#xa0;promise of rising living standards that characterised the post-war era has simply evaporated.</p><p>Capital markets, often dismissed by policymakers as short-term and irrational, have in fact priced this metabolic slowdown with remarkable precision. British equities have dramatically underperformed international comparators over the past two decades, delivering real returns less than half those of American markets. A substantial investment in British equities versus American equivalents would have resulted in a wealth differential exceeding a quarter-million pounds&#x2014;not market volatility but systematic underperformance reflecting declining total factor productivity, capital misallocation, and the extraction of economic rents rather than creation of value.</p><p>The pattern becomes clearer when examining specific sectors. Britain&apos;s largest housebuilders captured substantial market share and reported extraordinary profit margins year after year, yet their share prices have fallen dramatically in real terms over twenty-year periods despite these supernormal profits. The explanation lies in their business model: these firms generated returns not through productivity gains or innovation but via structural power&#x2014;withholding housing supply to maintain prices, extracting government subsidies, exploiting planning restrictions that created artificial scarcity. The planning system didn&apos;t block their profits; it enabled rent extraction. But this rent-seeking destroyed rather than created shareholder value over the long term, as volatility and political risk overwhelmed short-term gains.</p><p>Energy utilities present an even starker picture. The parent company of British Gas lost three-quarters of its market value over the post-crisis period despite consumer energy bills rising substantially during the same timeframe. The Big Six energy companies collectively incurred interest expenses more than double their tax payments, while their effective borrowing costs substantially exceeded government rates&#x2014;indicating severe capital inefficiency and fundamental misalignment between their business models and the emerging energy transition. Companies structured for centralised fossil generation attempting to operate in a distributed renewable paradigm have seen asset write-downs, refinancing costs, and regulatory uncertainty systematically destroy shareholder value even as consumers pay more.</p><h3 id=\"beyond-policy-failure-to-systems-transition\"><strong>Beyond Policy Failure to Systems Transition</strong></h3><p>These are not isolated statistics amenable to policy fixes but manifestations of what the Planetary Phase Shift framework identifies as a systemic transition from fossil-fuelled expansion to post-carbon reorganisation. At the thermodynamic substrate of this transition lies a simple but inexorable reality: the Energy Return on Investment of fossil fuels has been declining for half a century. Where society once received thirty-five units of energy for every unit invested in extraction during the post-war boom, that ratio has now fallen below fifteen-to-one and continues its descent.</p><p>This might sound like an abstraction, but its economic implications are concrete and pervasive. Every barrel of oil now delivers less surplus energy to society while requiring more energy for extraction, processing, and distribution. As this net energy declines, economies face a binding constraint: each additional unit of GDP requires proportionally more energy and material input to produce. The friction manifests as rising costs, declining productivity growth, mounting debt, and the proliferation of&#xa0;bureaucratic complexity&#x2014;not because policymakers have become less competent but because the underlying thermodynamic foundation of industrial growth is eroding.</p><p>This energetic contraction propagates through what the PPS framework terms Earth-System Disruption and Human-System Destabilisation feedbacks&#x2014;the twin engines of breakdown. Environmental stress from climate shocks and resource depletion drives social stress in the form of economic volatility and political polarisation, which in turn accelerates environmental damage, locking societies into vicious cycles. Britain&apos;s planning gridlock, fiscal exhaustion, and infrastructural sclerosis are not isolated bureaucratic failings but local expressions of this global back-loop dynamic.</p><p>The&#xa0;<em>UK Foundations</em>&#xa0;narrative of &quot;banned investment&quot; conceals a deeper truth that the Planetary Phase Shift framework makes visible: when a civilisation&apos;s net energy declines, its ability to translate capital into real productivity falls&#x2014;even when money and labour are available in abundance. Britain&apos;s capital stock has actually contracted in recent years while other G7 economies saw substantial growth. The regulatory drag, planning inertia, and public opposition that&#xa0;<em>UK Foundations</em>&#xa0;decries are social expressions of this energy-information feedback&#x2014;a system under thermodynamic stress reflexively conserving stability as its energy throughput diminishes.</p><p>In Holling&apos;s adaptive cycle framework, this is the conservation phase transitioning into release: a society that traded resilience for efficiency during the long growth phase now finds its optimised systems becoming brittle and maladaptive as the external energy environment shifts. The bureaucracy that appears as &quot;the blob&quot; is not an autonomous obstacle but an emergent property of this phase&#x2014;institutions designed for stable high-EROI conditions attempting to manage volatile low-EROI realities with increasingly inadequate tools.</p><p>Britain is not a &quot;failed developer&quot; but a microcosm of the planetary back-loop: a society whose organisational software&#x2014;centralised planning, fossil-fuel finance, GDP growth imperatives&#x2014;no longer matches its material hardware. Every apparent malfunction in the&#xa0;<em>UK Foundations</em>&#xa0;inventory signals the same underlying transition. The only viable path forward lies not in attempting to restore the unrestorable but through &#x3b1;-phase reorganisation: building new systems designed for the energy and ecological realities of the twenty-first century rather than the twentieth.</p><h2 id=\"ii-the-overdetermination-of-stagnation\"><strong>II. The Overdetermination of Stagnation</strong></h2><p>While declining fossil fuel energy returns provide the thermodynamic substrate of Britain&apos;s crisis, the stagnation is what systems theorists term overdetermined&#x2014;multiple sufficient causes operate simultaneously, each reinforcing the others through complex feedback loops. Understanding this causal multiplicity is essential for policymakers, investors, and thought leaders, as it explains why simple interventions like planning reform or infrastructure spending alone cannot restore growth. The system&apos;s pathology is not linear but networked, and its resolution requires correspondingly systemic thinking.</p><h3 id=\"institutional-rigidity-and-the-late-phase-trap\"><strong>Institutional Rigidity and the Late-Phase Trap</strong></h3><p>Britain exemplifies what Holling&apos;s adaptive cycle framework terms a late-K-phase rigidity trap: an over-optimised system that has progressively traded resilience for&#xa0;efficiency until external shocks reveal its brittleness. During the fossil-fuelled front-loop of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Britain expanded its economic and institutional complexity on the foundation of cheap energy, imperial reach, and favourable demographics. This complexity served the nation well during growth phases, enabling sophisticated coordination, risk management, and resource allocation.</p><p>But by the 1970s, as the energy surplus from North Sea oil began its inevitable decline and as the easy gains from post-war reconstruction exhausted themselves, each additional increment of infrastructure or policy coordination began delivering diminishing returns. The response across successive governments&#x2014;both Labour and Conservative&#x2014;followed the predictable pattern of conservation-phase systems: tightening fiscal controls, proliferating regulations, centralising decision-making, attempting to impose order on mounting disorder. These were not irrational choices but the reflexive behaviour of mature systems seeking to conserve stability as their energy throughput begins to contract.</p><p>The result has been institutions that once enabled adaptation now obstruct it. Market sector growth has fallen to roughly one-third of its pre-crisis rate despite rising employment and educational attainment, indicating that the binding constraints are no longer labour quantity or human capital but the organisational and physical capital frameworks within which that labour operates. This represents not policy incompetence but a fundamental phase-mismatch: organisations optimised for the stable thermodynamics and abundant energy of the twentieth century attempting to operate in the volatile, declining-EROI conditions of the twenty-first.</p><p>The 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, often vilified by&#xa0;<em>UK Foundations</em>&#xa0;as the original sin of British stagnation, emerges in this light as a symptom rather than a cause. It represented a conservation-phase response to perceived market failures in interwar development&#x2014;an attempt to impose rationality and order on what appeared as chaotic sprawl. That it has ossified into an obstacle reflects not the malice or incompetence of its designers but the inexorable tendency of institutions in the K-phase to accumulate complexity, resist change, and eventually become impediments to the very adaptation they were meant to enable.</p><h3 id=\"the-housing-paradox-scarcity-as-political-economy\"><strong>The Housing Paradox: Scarcity as Political Economy</strong></h3><p>Britain&apos;s housing crisis presents a particularly stark illustration of how what appears as policy failure is actually political economy functioning as designed. With populations essentially identical in size, France possesses substantially more dwellings than Britain&#x2014;a deficit measured in millions of homes. London&apos;s metropolitan footprint has barely expanded since the 1930s while Paris&apos;s geographic extent has roughly tripled. This supply restriction creates profound spatial mismatch between where productivity is highest and where people can afford to live, throttling the agglomeration economies that drive modern economic growth.</p><p>Yet this outcome is not an accident or bureaucratic oversight&#x2014;it is the intended consequence of a political economy in which the median voter benefits from housing supply restriction. With homeownership rates around two-thirds and housing wealth concentrated among older voters with higher turnout rates, the electoral incentives powerfully favour maintaining scarcity. The planning system that&#xa0;<em>UK Foundations</em>&#xa0;attacks as dysfunctional is actually performing its political function with brutal efficiency: implementing the preferences of the decisive electoral coalition.</p><p>The economic consequences cascade through the system. Where Britain once saw millions migrate internally toward centres of rising productivity&#x2014;from agricultural regions to industrial cities in the nineteenth century, from declining industries to rising ones in the mid-twentieth&#x2014;such mobility has now frozen. Only the highest earners can afford to relocate to the most productive cities, while everyone else faces either extortionate housing costs or long-distance commuting that destroys quality of life. The result is trapped talent, constrained business expansion, and a self-reinforcing cycle where the most promising sectors cannot access the labour they need while workers cannot access the opportunities that exist.</p><p>Cambridge exemplifies this dysfunction with crystalline clarity. As Britain&apos;s most dynamic biotech cluster, it faces binding physical constraints with minimal laboratory space vacant and Environment Agency blocking new housing due to water infrastructure limitations. Proposed major investments&#x2014;film studios, data centres&#x2014;have been rejected despite offering substantial economic benefits. The planning system isn&apos;t accidentally throttling Britain&apos;s most promising industries; it is systematically preventing the spatial reorganisation that economic transformation requires.</p><p>The housebuilders themselves reveal the deeper pathology. Despite capturing substantial market share and reporting extraordinary profit margins sustained over years, their long-term shareholder returns are negative in real terms. This paradox&#x2014;supernormal profits coexisting with value destruction&#x2014;can only be explained by recognising that these firms extract rents rather than create value. They profit from scarcity itself, from government demand subsidies, from land banking, from exploiting the very planning restrictions that&#xa0;<em>UK Foundations</em>decries. When capitalism becomes about gaming regulatory constraints rather than productive innovation, the result is wealth transfer rather than wealth creation.</p><h3 id=\"capital-deepening-collapse-and-the-energy-price-shock\"><strong>Capital Deepening Collapse and the Energy Price Shock</strong></h3><p>Beyond institutional rigidity and housing constraints lies a more fundamental problem: Britain has experienced a collapse in capital deepening&#x2014;the accumulation of machinery, equipment, and structures that amplify worker productivity. Gross fixed capital formation as a share of GDP lags substantially behind France and Germany, but the problem goes deeper than aggregate investment rates. The composition and efficiency of that investment has deteriorated markedly.</p><p>Workers today are substantially better educated than two decades ago, with degree attainment nearly doubling, yet this human capital accumulation has not translated into commensurate productivity gains. The binding constraint is not worker quality but the physical and organisational capital they have to work with. Industrial electricity prices more than doubled in real terms between the mid-2000s and the Ukraine crisis, making energy-intensive manufacturing progressively unviable in Britain. Per-capita electricity generation is barely half that of France and less than two-fifths that of the United States&#x2014;closer to middle-income countries than to advanced economies.</p><p>This energy deficit both reflects and reinforces broader capital allocation failures. Infrastructure costs have exploded due to centralisation destroying the cost discipline that once came from local or private financing bearing direct consequences. High-speed rail projects cost multiples per mile of equivalent Continental projects. Tram systems, where Britain builds them at all, cost several times French equivalents. The planning documentation for major projects has metastasised from hundreds of pages to hundreds of thousands, consuming hundreds of millions in process costs before construction even begins.</p><p>The Edinburgh Tram project illuminates the mechanism: the phase funded primarily by central government experienced substantial cost overruns, while the phase financed locally against future revenues came in notably cheaper per mile. When financiers bear risk directly, they impose discipline&#x2014;consultations are bounded, design changes minimise, contractors face meaningful penalties. When costs diffuse across a vast national electorate, each project&apos;s waste remains &quot;invisibly small&quot; individually but aggregates to catastrophic bloat systemically.</p><p>Yet even identifying these proximate causes&#x2014;institutional rigidity, housing constraints, capital deepening collapse, infrastructure cost disease&#x2014;does not fully explain Britain&apos;s stagnation. These are themselves symptoms of the deeper thermodynamic shift. As net energy available to society declines, systems naturally become more complex, coordination costs rise, conflicts over distribution intensify, and societies direct proportionally more effort toward managing internal frictions rather than generating new output. What appears as bureaucratic incompetence or political cowardice is often the visible surface of invisible thermodynamic constraints.</p><h2 id=\"iii-the-energy-transition-why-distributed-renewables-outperform-centralised-nuclear\"><strong>III. The Energy Transition: Why Distributed Renewables Outperform Centralised Nuclear</strong></h2><p>The&#xa0;<em>UK Foundations</em>&#xa0;prescription&#x2014;that Britain should reindustrialise through large-scale nuclear deployment&#x2014;exemplifies strategic thinking trapped in the previous era&apos;s paradigm. While nuclear technology retains legitimate niche applications, the centralised gigawatt-scale deployment model it advocates is economically, temporally, and thermodynamically misaligned with Britain&apos;s immediate needs and with the trajectory of the global energy transition. The Planetary Phase Shift framework reveals why attempting to restore fossil-nuclear infrastructure represents not pragmatic realism but thermodynamic denial.</p><h3 id=\"the-nuclear-thermodynamic-trap\"><strong>The Nuclear Thermodynamic Trap</strong></h3><p>Modern nuclear power appears clean only at the electricity output level&#x2014;the point where electrons flow into the grid. But the Planetary Phase Shift framework demands scrutiny of full life-cycle energy returns, and here the picture darkens considerably. Once the complete supply chain is accounted for&#x2014;uranium mining in progressively lower-grade ores, isotope enrichment, fuel fabrication, the enormous concrete and steel requirements of plant construction, the long-term costs of decommissioning and waste management&#x2014;nuclear&apos;s effective Energy Return on Investment falls to levels comparable with mature oil fields, somewhere in the range of five-to-fifteen-to-one depending on methodology and assumptions.</p><p>This might seem adequate in isolation, but the critical insight lies in the trajectory rather than the absolute level. As global fossil fuel EROI continues its inexorable decline, the energy cost of building nuclear infrastructure rises in tandem, because virtually every step in the nuclear supply chain remains dependent on fossil energy. Concrete production, steel fabrication, heavy transport, construction equipment&#x2014;all currently powered predominantly by coal, oil, and gas. The apparent paradox resolves into thermodynamic trap: building nuclear power to replace declining fossil fuels requires spending declining fossil energy to create infrastructure that barely exceeds the energy return of its inputs.</p><p>From Holling&apos;s adaptive cycle perspective, nuclear expansion in current form represents the late-K-phase reflex: feeding remaining energy into rigid structures that can no longer evolve. Britain&apos;s own nuclear experience validates this concern with brutal empirical clarity. The newest reactors cost more than double per unit capacity what earlier generations achieved, with construction times stretching beyond a decade and financing costs now consuming the majority of total project expenditure. Hinkley Point C has absorbed tens of billions of pounds without producing a single electron, its completion perpetually receding into the future as costs escalate and timelines extend.</p><p>The international pattern reinforces the diagnosis. Western nuclear projects systematically fail on cost and schedule&#x2014;France, Finland, and the United States have all experienced similar disasters&#x2014;while East Asian projects succeed primarily through conditions Britain cannot replicate: state financing eliminating risk premiums, regulatory stability preventing mid-construction rule changes, fleet construction enabling learning curves, domestic supply chains and skilled workforces built over decades of continuous deployment. Even South Korea&apos;s relatively successful model, when deployed in the UAE, produced costs still far above what renewables now achieve, and South Korea itself is now pivoting away from nuclear toward renewables in its domestic market.</p><h3 id=\"the-renewable-revolution-exponential-learning-curves\"><strong>The Renewable Revolution: Exponential Learning Curves</strong></h3><p>By contrast, solar-wind-battery technologies follow precisely the opposite trajectory, exhibiting the characteristics of the &#x3b1;-phase reorganisation: modular, distributed, adaptive, improving exponentially rather than degrading. According to authoritative sources like the International Renewable Energy Agency, global weighted average levelised costs of electricity from solar photovoltaics have fallen approximately ninety percent from 2010 to present. Onshore wind has fallen nearly seventy percent over the same period, while battery storage costs have collapsed more than ninety percent, approaching the threshold where grid-scale storage becomes economically transformative.</p><p>These are not modest improvements but exponential learning curves driven by manufacturing scale, material science advances, and competition across multiple technology pathways simultaneously. Installed costs have declined comparably: solar systems that cost several dollars per watt a decade ago now install for a fraction of that, with wind showing similarly dramatic reductions. By 2024, more than ninety percent of newly commissioned utility-scale renewable capacity delivered power cheaper than the&#xa0;cheapest new fossil alternative, helping avoid hundreds of billions in fossil fuel costs globally.</p><p>The economic implications extend far beyond simple cost comparisons. The speed differential between technologies has become decisive in a volatile, energy-transitioning world. Nuclear projects require ten to fifteen years from final investment decision to first power, during which financing costs accumulate, technologies evolve, and political winds shift. Solar and wind projects deploy in months, battery storage in weeks to months. In an era where every year of delay amplifies exposure to fossil fuel price volatility, debt accumulation at rising interest rates, stranded-asset risk, and regulatory uncertainty, time-to-power has become the critical variable that orthodox energy analysis systematically underweights.</p><p>A concrete comparison illustrates the divergence. Twenty billion pounds invested in a large nuclear project like Sizewell C would deliver zero operational capacity for more than a decade, during which it contributes nothing to emissions reduction, grid reliability, or energy security while consuming scarce capital and political attention. The same twenty billion distributed across solar, wind, and storage would deploy dozens of gigawatts becoming operational within years, delivering immediate emissions reductions, enhancing grid resilience through diversity, and creating the foundation for the next wave of innovation.</p><h3 id=\"the-rethinkx-superpower-model-abundance-economics\"><strong>The RethinkX Superpower Model: Abundance Economics</strong></h3><p>The most radical insight from cutting-edge energy systems analysis emerges from RethinkX&apos;s modeling of what they term &quot;Clean Energy Superpower&quot;&#x2014;the counterintuitive discovery that deliberately overbuilding renewable generation and storage actually reduces total system costs while unlocking transformative economic possibilities. By deploying solar and wind capacity several times greater than average demand and pairing it with substantial but not unlimited storage, the system generates vast quantities of near-zero marginal cost electricity during high-production periods.</p><p>This &quot;superpower&quot;&#x2014;surplus electricity available at production costs approaching zero&#x2014;becomes the foundation for an entirely new energy economy. Green hydrogen production for heavy industry, steel, chemicals, and aviation fuel becomes economically viable when electricity is essentially free. Desalination to address water scarcity, carbon capture powered by surplus rather than displacing needed generation, industrial process heat, data centre operations&#x2014;all become possible at scales that seemed economically absurd when conceived in the fossil-nuclear paradigm of expensive, scarce energy.</p><p>Germany&apos;s energy transition, despite its challenges and setbacks, offers glimpses of this potential. Periods of renewable overproduction now regularly drive wholesale electricity prices negative&#x2014;a signal not of failure but of the transformation from scarcity economics to abundance economics. With adequate storage and intelligent demand management, these periods of &quot;waste&quot; become opportunities for economic activities that were previously unthinkable. The circular energy economy emerges where surplus electricity powers processes that enable material circularity, closing loops that remained open when energy was scarce and expensive.</p><p>The governance implications mirror the technical architecture. If the energy transition is to function as genuine &#x3b1;-phase transformation rather than merely substituting renewable for fossil inputs within unchanged power structures, its political architecture must embody distributed intelligence. RethinkX&apos;s concept of an &quot;Energy Bill of Rights&quot;&#x2014;guaranteeing citizens and communities the right to generate, store, and trade electricity within technical safety parameters&#x2014;represents not utopian idealism but recognition that resilience in complex adaptive systems comes from diversity, redundancy, and distributed agency rather than centralised control.</p><p>Britain&apos;s challenge, then, is not choosing between nuclear and renewables as competing technologies but recognising they represent competing paradigms: centralised versus distributed, rigid versus adaptive, declining versus improving cost curves, decade-scale versus month-scale deployment, fossil-supply-chain-dependent versus increasingly autonomous. The choice Britain faces is whether to channel its limited capital and political will into attempting restoration of a high-cost centralised paradigm increasingly misaligned with thermodynamic and economic reality, or into accelerating the reorganisation around low-cost distributed systems where capital efficiency improves exponentially with each iteration.</p><h2 id=\"iv-market-signals-capital-pricing-the-impossible\"><strong>IV. Market Signals: Capital Pricing the Impossible</strong></h2><p>While policymakers debate theoretical frameworks and economists construct elaborate models, capital markets&#x2014;that supposedly irrational, short-term, casino-like institution of modern capitalism&#x2014;have been pricing Britain&apos;s metabolic slowdown with remarkable precision and consistency. The systematic divergence between official narratives of recovery and actual investor returns reveals a fundamental disconnect between political economy and thermodynamic reality that thought leaders and institutional investors would be imprudent to ignore.</p><h3 id=\"the-equity-markets-verdict\"><strong>The Equity Market&apos;s Verdict</strong></h3><p>British equities have delivered real returns less than half those of American markets over the past two decades&#x2014;a differential so substantial and sustained that it cannot be dismissed as temporary volatility or sector rotation. This represents systematic underperformance reflecting the declining total factor productivity, capital misallocation, and rent extraction that characterise Britain&apos;s economic model. An investor who placed substantial capital in British versus American equities would face a wealth differential exceeding a quarter-million pounds on a modest six-figure investment&#x2014;not because of poor stock-picking but because of systematic dysfunction in the underlying economy.</p><p>More revealing than aggregate indices are the sector-specific patterns that illuminate precisely where value is being created versus destroyed. Britain&apos;s largest housebuilders present a particularly instructive case study in how regulatory-induced scarcity creates rent-seeking rather than productivity. These firms captured substantial market share and reported extraordinary profit margins sustained across years, yet their long-term shareholder returns are dramatically negative in real terms. Share prices that peaked before the financial crisis remain substantially below those levels two decades later despite intervening profits measured in billions.</p><p>The paradox resolves when recognising the business model: these firms generated returns not through innovation or productivity gains but via structural power&#x2014;withholding supply to maintain prices, extracting government subsidies that at times accounted for nearly half their sales, renegotiating development obligations with local authorities, exploiting limited competition in land markets. The planning system didn&apos;t block their profitability; it enabled rent extraction. But rent-seeking without value creation ultimately destroys rather than preserves capital, as sector volatility and political risk overwhelm short-term gains. This is capitalism failing at its fundamental purpose: allocating capital to productive rather than extractive uses.</p><p>The energy sector reveals even more acute value destruction. Centrica, once a FTSE 100 constituent, lost three-quarters of its market value despite consumer energy bills rising substantially over the same period. The disconnect between rising prices and collapsing equity value reflects fundamental misalignment: companies structured for centralised fossil generation attempting to operate in an emerging distributed renewable paradigm experience asset write-downs, refinancing costs, and regulatory uncertainty that systematically destroy shareholder value even as consumers pay more. The incumbent utilities are trapped in a declining business model, their substantial physical assets becoming stranded capital as the energy transition accelerates.</p><p>Conversely, global renewable energy leaders demonstrate the opposite trajectory. Though most pure-plays trade on foreign exchanges due to Britain&apos;s market structure bias toward oil majors and legacy utilities, their performance signals where capital is migrating. Companies operating substantial renewable portfolios have delivered sustained outperformance versus fossil incumbents, indicating that markets understand&#x2014;even if policymakers remain in denial&#x2014;that the energy transition is not coming but here, and that betting against exponential learning curves in favour of declining ones destroys rather than preserves wealth.</p><h3 id=\"infrastructure-as-capital-destruction\"><strong>Infrastructure as Capital Destruction</strong></h3><p>Major British infrastructure projects have become case studies in how process worship and misaligned incentives destroy rather than create capital value. High-speed rail costs multiples per mile of equivalent Continental projects. Planning documentation for major schemes has metastasised from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of pages, consuming hundreds of millions in process costs before construction begins&#x2014;in some cases exceeding the cost of actually building equivalent infrastructure elsewhere. Nuclear plants absorb tens of billions while producing zero electricity, their completion dates perpetually receding as costs escalate.</p><p>The economic consequence of every billion pounds in cost overrun or delay is profound. Infrastructure projects typically generate economic multipliers, meaning foregone or delayed projects represent multiples of their direct cost in lost economic activity. The opportunity cost compounds: capital consumed by dysfunctional megaprojects could have deployed distributed renewable capacity at several times the scale, operational within years rather than decades. At prevailing interest rates, every billion pounds of wasted capital requires tens of millions annually in perpetual debt service&#x2014;a permanent claim on future productivity that delivers nothing in return.</p><p>Yet beneath these proximate failures lies a deeper pattern that the Planetary Phase Shift framework illuminates. Infrastructure costs are exploding not because engineers have become incompetent or because contractors have become corrupt&#x2014;though both phenomena exist&#x2014;but because societies in the back-loop of their adaptive cycle direct proportionally more energy toward managing internal complexity rather than generating new output. The planning documents that consume hundreds of millions represent attempts to achieve legal defensibility in an increasingly litigious environment, transfer risk from decision-makers to consultants, provide political cover through &quot;exhaustive process,&quot; and enable objectors to achieve de facto veto through process exhaustion.</p><p>This is not bureaucracy failing to make decisions&#x2014;obstruction has become the decision. When net energy declines and political consensus fragments, bureaucratic complexity becomes a socially acceptable mechanism for saying &quot;no&quot; to change while preserving the appearance of rationality and deliberation. The system is not broken; it is functioning precisely as the political economy requires, implementing the preferences of the decisive electoral coalition while diffusing responsibility across enough actors that no one can be held individually accountable for collective failure.</p><p>The verdict from capital markets, then, is unambiguous: legacy fossil-nuclear utilities face progressive value destruction as the energy transition accelerates; housebuilders extract rents without creating value through regulatory arbitrage; infrastructure megaprojects systematically destroy returns through misaligned incentives and process pathology; distributed renewable systems exhibit exponential cost improvement and deployment acceleration; global clean energy leaders sustain dramatic outperformance versus fossil incumbents. British policymakers and institutional investors face a choice: continue subsidising value-destroying incumbents through contracts, capacity markets, and demand subsidies, or accelerate transition toward distributed systems where capital efficiency improves exponentially with each deployment cycle.</p><p>Markets have already made their judgment. The question is whether policy will follow thermodynamic reality or persist in fighting it until the last reserves of capital and credibility exhaust themselves in futile attempts to restore what cannot be restored.</p><h2 id=\"v-the-reorganisation-imperative-from-restoration-to-renewal\"><strong>V. The Reorganisation Imperative: From Restoration to Renewal</strong></h2><p>Britain&apos;s path forward requires not merely &quot;building more&quot; infrastructure or &quot;getting out of the way&quot; of private investment&#x2014;the stale dichotomy that dominates policy debate&#x2014;but fundamental reconfiguration of institutional, financial, and governance structures around the emergent realities of post-carbon civilisation. The Planetary Phase Shift framework identifies this as the &#x3b1;-phase: the reorganisation stage where adaptive capacity can grow faster than entropy accumulates, but only if social systems align themselves with rather than against thermodynamic and ecological constraints. This is not about managing decline but about building differently for a fundamentally different energy and information metabolism.</p><h3 id=\"energy-system-redesign-the-path-to-distributed-abundance\"><strong>Energy System Redesign: The Path to Distributed Abundance</strong></h3><p>The reorganisation of Britain&apos;s energy system must begin from recognition that the goal is not merely decarbonisation&#x2014;replacing fossil inputs with low-carbon alternatives within essentially unchanged system architecture&#x2014;but transformation toward&#xa0;fundamentally different energy economics. The distributed solar-wind-battery paradigm offers not just lower emissions but lower costs, faster deployment, greater resilience, and the foundation for economic activities that remain unviable in the scarcity economics of fossil-nuclear systems.</p><p>The strategic priority is deployment at scale of renewable generation deliberately overbuilt relative to average demand, paired with storage systems operating across multiple timescales. This appears economically irrational within conventional energy economics&#x2014;why build capacity that sits idle much of the time?&#x2014;but becomes transformative when recognising that the marginal cost of renewable electricity approaches zero and that storage costs continue their exponential decline. The result is a system that cuts total costs dramatically while generating vast quantities of &quot;superpower&quot;&#x2014;surplus electricity at near-zero cost enabling entirely new industrial processes and economic sectors.</p><p>This transition requires more than technology deployment; it demands institutional innovation to match the distributed architecture of the energy system itself. Guaranteeing citizens and communities the right to generate, store, and trade electricity within technical safety parameters converts passive consumers into active producers of resilience, spreading both agency and risk across the system rather than concentrating it in centralised utilities vulnerable to single points of failure. The political architecture must mirror the technical form: moving from control hierarchies to coordination networks, from centralised planning to polycentric experimentation within broad ecological constraints.</p><p>Grid infrastructure modernises not to connect remote centralised generation to distant consumption but to enable power flow in all directions, balancing surplus and scarcity across regions and timescales through intelligent orchestration rather than rigid scheduling. Storage deploys in cascade: batteries for seconds-to-hours balancing, pumped hydro for hours-to-days, hydrogen for seasonal storage enabling weeks without wind or sun, vehicle-to-grid from millions of electric vehicles providing massive distributed buffering. Demand becomes flexible through price signals and automation, with industrial processes, building systems, and transport infrastructure absorbing surplus when available and shedding load when scarce.</p><p>The transformation unlocks economic possibilities that remain marginal or impossible in fossil-nuclear paradigm. Green hydrogen production for steelmaking, chemicals, and aviation becomes viable when electricity is nearly free during high renewable output. Desalination powered by surplus renewables addresses water constraints that currently block urban and industrial expansion. Data centres&#x2014;energy-intensive but economically vital&#x2014;become demand response assets rather than rigid base-load consumers, absorbing superpower when available while load-shifting when constrained. Industrial process heat, currently dependent on natural gas, transitions to resistance heating and heat pumps powered by abundant clean electricity.</p><h3 id=\"spatial-reorganisation-cities-as-adaptive-networks\"><strong>Spatial Reorganisation: Cities as Adaptive Networks</strong></h3><p>Housing and transport policy must follow parallel logic: not restoring twentieth-century patterns of sprawl, automobile dependence, and energy-intensive suburban expansion, but building for the &#x3b1;-phase city&#x2014;dense, modular, electrified, functioning as networks&#xa0;of distributed generation and shared mobility rather than hierarchical systems of centralised provision and atomised consumption.</p><p>The strategic priority in housing is retrofit rather than greenfield expansion. Britain&apos;s housing stock is the oldest in Europe, with a substantial proportion predating modern insulation and heating standards. Space heating alone accounts for the majority of residential energy consumption. Systematic deployment of heat pumps combined with building envelope improvements could reduce heating demand by more than half while eliminating dependence on natural gas entirely. The per-dwelling cost appears substantial in isolation but becomes transformative at scale: lower than many proposed infrastructure megaprojects while delivering greater economic and carbon benefits, creating domestic employment in installation and manufacturing, improving energy security, reducing fuel poverty, and enhancing housing asset values.</p><p>New housing construction must escape the trap of reproducing automobile-dependent suburban forms that lock in energy consumption patterns for decades. Development corporations with genuine land assembly powers and self-financing through value capture can deliver mixed-use, transit-oriented development at density levels that support walking, cycling, and public transport as default rather than aspirational modes. This is not aesthetic preference but thermodynamic necessity: distributed renewable systems work best at scales where generation, storage, and consumption can be locally balanced, requiring urban forms that concentrate activity while maintaining human scale and ecological integration.</p><p>Transport transformation follows naturally from spatial reorganisation. Active travel infrastructure&#x2014;protected cycling routes, pedestrian-priority streets, e-bike networks&#x2014;can shift substantial modal share at modest cost compared to major transit projects, delivering immediate health benefits through increased physical activity while reducing road congestion and air pollution. Electrified public transport&#x2014;bus networks with frequent service and affordable fares, metro and tram systems in larger cities&#x2014;expands labour market access more effectively than road capacity additions, increasing effective city size without corresponding land consumption.</p><p>The critical insight is that spatial form determines energy consumption and mobility patterns for decades or generations once established. Building compact, mixed-use, transit-oriented development now creates the conditions for low-energy, high-amenity urban living in perpetuity. Building automobile-dependent sprawl locks in opposite outcomes. The choice Britain makes in the coming decade will determine whether cities become assets or liabilities in the energy transition.</p><h3 id=\"governance-architecture-from-control-to-coordination\"><strong>Governance Architecture: From Control to Coordination</strong></h3><p>The planning and governance reforms Britain needs are not those imagined by UK Foundations&#x2014;centralising power in Treasury to override objections and &quot;get things built&quot;&#x2014;but rather radical decentralisation that aligns decision-making authority with both responsibility for outcomes and capacity for local adaptation. The late-industrial state has become an information bottleneck: decisions trapped in hierarchies while environmental and economic conditions change faster than bureaucracies can process.</p><p>The solution lies in polycentric governance architectures where city-regions possess genuine autonomy over infrastructure investment, financing it through own-source revenues and borrowing against future tax yields. This creates the cost discipline that centralised funding systematically destroys: when local financiers bear risk directly, they impose limits on gold-plating, constrain design changes, manage contractors effectively, and complete projects on time and budget. The evidence is overwhelming&#x2014;from historical private infrastructure delivery in Britain to contemporary French metro systems to the dramatic cost differentials between centrally and locally financed infrastructure in modern Britain.</p><p>Regulatory consolidation must replace the current archipelago of agencies&#x2014;energy, water, transport, environment&#x2014;each with separate mandates, timelines, and approval processes. A single infrastructure consenting authority operating under clear statutory timescales and expedited judicial review processes can dramatically reduce approval times while maintaining environmental protection and public consultation. The key is shifting from discretionary to rules-based systems: if proposals meet published technical standards, approval becomes administrative rather than political, eliminating the de facto veto power that enables indefinite delay through process exhaustion.</p><p>Development rights, currently parceled out through opaque negotiations and subject to arbitrary political interference, should follow clear form-based codes specifying height, setback, use intensity, and design standards. Projects meeting these codes proceed without discretionary approval; those exceeding them face transparent criteria for variance. This shifts planning from negotiation&#x2014;where local objectors have asymmetric power and developers capture rents through political connections&#x2014;to rule of law where outcomes are predictable and capital can be efficiently allocated.</p><p>The meta-principle is moving from control to coordination: central government sets outcomes&#x2014;carbon budgets, housing targets, service standards&#x2014;but not methods. Multiple jurisdictions experiment with different approaches, creating comparative information about what works. Failures remain local rather than systemic, while successes can be rapidly emulated. This is how complex adaptive systems generate innovation and resilience: through diversity, redundancy, and parallel experimentation rather than optimised central planning.</p><h3 id=\"economic-restructuring-from-rents-to-returns\"><strong>Economic Restructuring: From Rents to Returns</strong></h3><p>Britain&apos;s financial architecture must redirect capital from rent extraction to productive investment, from speculation on artificial scarcity to genuine innovation and efficiency improvement. The current system produces perverse outcomes: bank lending concentrates overwhelmingly on residential property, equity markets tilt toward oil majors and legacy utilities with minimal renewable exposure, venture capital targets consumer technology offering quick exits rather than patient capital for deep technology requiring longer gestation.</p><p>The first priority is pension fund reform enabling patient capital for infrastructure and industrial transition. British pension assets measured in trillions currently invest minimally in domestic productive capacity, preferring liquid international equities despite their underperformance. Modest mandatory allocations to British infrastructure&#x2014;renewable energy projects, retrofit programmes, transport systems,&#xa0;circular economy supply chains&#x2014;would unlock capital orders of magnitude larger than government can mobilise while providing stable inflation-protected returns appropriate for pension liabilities.</p><p>Regional development banking following German Sparkassen models can redirect credit to productive rather than speculative uses. Local institutions with statutory lending targets to regional small and medium enterprises, strict limits on property speculation, and public-benefit governance reinvesting profits in community infrastructure create alternative circuits of capital accumulation outside the London-dominated financial monoculture. This is not economic nationalism but recognition that financial systems optimised for global capital allocation systematically under-serve local productive capacity.</p><p>The meta-objective is shifting from wealth preservation through asset appreciation to wealth creation through productivity improvement. The former extracts rents from artificial scarcity; the latter generates genuine surplus through innovation and efficiency. An economy where most bank lending finances residential property purchases, where housebuilders profit from withholding supply, where utilities extract value through regulatory arbitrage rather than operational excellence&#x2014;this is capitalism failing at its fundamental purpose. Reorganisation means reconstructing financial circuits that reward productivity over rent-seeking, long-term investment over short-term speculation, distributed resilience over concentrated extraction.</p><h2 id=\"vi-beyond-growth-prosperity-within-boundaries\"><strong>VI. Beyond Growth: Prosperity Within Boundaries</strong></h2><p>The Planetary Phase Shift framework&apos;s most radical implication is that &quot;growth&quot; as conventionally measured&#x2014;expansion of material throughput, energy consumption, and GDP&#x2014;may be neither achievable nor desirable in an energy-descending, ecologically-bounded world. This does not portend stagnation or decline in human welfare but rather redefinition of prosperity around metrics that improve with falling material intensity: the energy and information efficiency of well-being.</p><h3 id=\"the-obsolescence-of-gdp\"><strong>The Obsolescence of GDP</strong></h3><p>Gross Domestic Product measures economic activity regardless of whether that activity enhances or degrades welfare. Healthcare spending rises as populations sicken, yet GDP treats this as growth rather than loss. Rebuilding after floods registers as economic activity rather than disaster. Financial services that allocate capital to property speculation rather than productive investment inflate GDP while hollowing out the real economy. Unpaid care work that sustains families and communities remains uncounted, while ecological degradation that depletes natural capital goes unrecognised until catastrophic thresholds breach.</p><p>The divergence between GDP and welfare has widened dramatically in the post-crisis era. GDP per capita grew marginally while median real wages fell substantially. Life expectancy stalled for the first time outside wartime in modern history. Mental health crises intensified with millions waiting for treatment compared to far fewer a decade prior. Ecological footprints expanded despite emissions falling domestically through offshoring production to countries with dirtier energy. More economic activity generated&#xa0;less human flourishing&#x2014;the signature of a system optimised for throughput rather than outcomes.</p><p>The Planetary Phase Shift framework proposes measuring prosperity through energy and information efficiency of well-being: the quality of life outcomes achieved per unit of energy and material consumed, and the speed at which societies adapt to changing conditions. Health-adjusted life expectancy per unit energy consumption captures how efficiently societies transform energy into human thriving. Countries like Costa Rica and Cuba achieve outcomes approaching Britain&apos;s with dramatically lower energy footprints, demonstrating that high welfare and low consumption can coexist with appropriate system design.</p><p>Shelter sufficiency per unit material input measures how effectively housing systems provide security, comfort, and community with minimal resource extraction. Modular construction, circular material flows, retrofit over new-build, shared facilities&#x2014;these approaches can dramatically reduce material intensity while maintaining or improving housing quality. Access to opportunity per unit transport energy captures how urban form and mobility systems connect people to jobs, services, and social networks&#x2014;active travel and efficient public transport enabling rich urban life with minimal energy compared to automobile dependence.</p><h3 id=\"the-circular-economy-as-growth-successor\"><strong>The Circular Economy as Growth Successor</strong></h3><p>In a material-constrained, energy-transitioning economy, wealth creation must shift from extraction to circulation. Britain currently consumes hundreds of millions of tonnes of material annually, of which only a small fraction circulates through reuse and recycling while the rest becomes waste. The circular economy potential is vast: construction alone could generate tens of billions in value through design for disassembly, material passports, and component standardisation. Electronics and textiles offer comparable opportunities through right-to-repair, deposit-return schemes, and service models replacing ownership.</p><p>The employment implications are substantial and progressive. Circular economy activities are inherently labour-intensive compared to virgin extraction, creating hundreds of thousands of net jobs concentrated in maintenance, remanufacturing, and local service provision rather than capital-intensive resource extraction. These jobs are geographically distributed rather than concentrated in declining industrial regions or global commodity extraction zones, providing economic opportunity in the very communities suffering from deindustrialisation.</p><p>The carbon implications are equally profound. Material production accounts for substantial emissions&#x2014;concrete, steel, plastics, chemicals. Reducing virgin material consumption while maintaining or improving services through circular flows can eliminate tens of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, equivalent to substantial fractions of current emissions from transport or heating. This is decarbonisation through dematerialisation rather than through fuel-switching alone.</p><h3 id=\"the-doughnut-framework-social-foundation-and-ecological-ceiling\"><strong>The Doughnut Framework: Social Foundation and Ecological Ceiling</strong></h3><p>Kate Raworth&apos;s Doughnut Economics provides operational framework for reorganisation: ensuring all people meet social foundation&#x2014;health, education,&#xa0;housing, meaningful participation&#x2014;while remaining within ecological ceiling defined by climate stability, biodiversity integrity, and resource regeneration rates. Britain currently fails on both dimensions: millions live in unaffordable or insecure housing, relative poverty affects substantial populations, health outcomes deteriorate, political disengagement intensifies. Simultaneously, carbon footprints exceed sustainable levels by multiples, biodiversity intactness ranks near global bottom, material consumption far exceeds what ecosystems can regenerate.</p><p>The reorganisation pathway thus has dual imperatives: lifting the floor to ensure universal access to foundations of dignified life, while lowering the ceiling to operate within planetary boundaries. These are not competing objectives but complementary: the systems that generate present inequality are also those driving ecological overshoot. Distributed renewable energy, circular material flows, compact urban form, public transport, preventative healthcare, education&#x2014;these enhance both equity and sustainability simultaneously.</p><p>The political feasibility question becomes whether transformation is possible given entrenched interests and electoral pressures. The answer is that business-as-usual is thermodynamically impossible. Continuation along current trajectories leads inexorably to fiscal collapse as debt service consumes all discretionary spending, social breakdown as generational wealth gaps exceed tolerance, and ecological overshoot triggering cascading system failures. The choice is not transformation versus stability but managed transition versus chaotic collapse.</p><h2 id=\"vii-conclusion-the-civilisational-choice\"><strong>VII. Conclusion: The Civilisational Choice</strong></h2><p>Britain&apos;s crisis is not that it has forgotten how to build but that it has been building the wrong things for the wrong system. The UK Foundations narrative confines analysis inside a shrinking loop of cause and effect&#x2014;bureaucrats block investment, therefore remove bureaucrats&#x2014;while missing the deeper pattern: the exhaustion of a civilisational operating system whose energy foundations, institutional assumptions, and growth imperatives belong to a geological age that is ending.</p><h3 id=\"evidence-of-metabolic-transition\"><strong>Evidence of Metabolic Transition</strong></h3><p>The evidence synthesised across this analysis demonstrates systematic metabolic slowdown across every domain. Economic indicators show productivity growth collapsed to fractions of historical rates, real wages stagnant across a generation, capital stock contracting while peer economies expand. Market signals reveal equity underperformance exceeding hundreds of thousands of pounds on modest investments, housebuilders destroying shareholder value through rent extraction despite supernormal profits, energy utilities losing three-quarters of value despite rising consumer bills, while global renewable leaders outperform fossil incumbents by multiples.</p><p>Public finance has deteriorated from manageable deficit to structural trap where debt service consumes resources equivalent to major government departments while delivering nothing productive. Energy systems are misaligned with transition needs: per-capita electricity generation is fractions of peer economies, industrial costs doubled driving manufacturing exodus, nuclear costs escalated dramatically while renewable&#xa0;costs collapsed exponentially, time-to-power stretches to decades for centralised systems while distributed alternatives deploy in months.</p><p>Political economy has frozen into rigidity trap where two-thirds homeownership creates median voter benefiting from supply restriction, trillions in housing wealth depend on continued scarcity, planning systems implement rather than defy these preferences, and discourse about bureaucratic &quot;blobs&quot; obscures intergenerational wealth transfers that constitute the greatest redistribution in British history&#x2014;from young to old, from productive to rent-seeking, from future to present.</p><h3 id=\"the-pathway-to-reorganisation\"><strong>The Pathway to Reorganisation</strong></h3><p>Escaping this trap requires not crusade against bureaucracy or nostalgic restoration of nuclear-fossil infrastructure but deliberate pivot toward reorganisation around post-carbon realities.

Thermodynamically, fossil fuel energy returns continue declining; delaying energy transition infrastructure buildout means attempting construction as energy surplus contracts further, making each additional year exponentially more difficult. Technologically, renewable learning curves are accelerating currently; delay means losing manufacturing capacity and expertise to nations that move decisively while costs rise domestically as global deployment outpaces British participation.</p><p>Politically, demographic transition sees millennials becoming median voters within this decade; this cohort is substantially less likely to own homes and thus potentially&#xa0;receptive to pro-building politics&#x2014;but if locked out of housing until middle age, historical patterns suggest authoritarian rather than progressive political responses. If Britain acts decisively now, it catches exponential cost declines, builds during demographic window of opportunity, and establishes reorganisation template demonstrating to other nations that prosperity within planetary boundaries is achievable. If Britain delays further, it misses technology cost curves, faces hostile political economy as homeowner electoral dominance peaks, and watches others capture reorganisation advantages.</p><h3 id=\"restoration-versus-reorganisation\"><strong>Restoration Versus Reorganisation</strong></h3><p>UK Foundations offers restoration: remove planning barriers, build nuclear and high-speed rail at scale, restore growth trajectories from decades past. This appeals because it is familiar&#x2014;Britain knows how to do large infrastructure projects, or believes it does, and restoration promises return to comfortable certainty of post-war expansion.</p><p>But restoration is thermodynamically impossible. The fossil-powered growth regime is ending whether Britain wills it or not. Attempting to rebuild twentieth-century infrastructure at twenty-first-century scale while net energy declines produces the catabolic trap: consuming remaining surplus energy to create assets that arrive too late, cost too much, and function poorly in the emerging post-carbon world. This is not pessimism but thermodynamic realism.</p><p>Planetary Phase Shift offers reorganisation: building new energy metabolism around ambient flows rather than stored deposits, new spatial forms optimising for resilience rather than throughput, new governance structures enabling adaptation rather than control, new prosperity metrics valuing well-being efficiency rather than material accumulation. This is unfamiliar and uncertain&#x2014;we are inventing it as we proceed, learning through experimentation, accepting that some efforts will fail while others succeed.</p><p>But reorganisation is thermodynamically aligned. It works with declining fossil energy returns by shifting to renewable energy harvesting that improves rather than degrades over time. It builds adaptive capacity through diversity and modularity rather than brittle efficiency through centralisation. It creates prosperity within rather than beyond planetary boundaries by measuring success through outcome efficiency rather than throughput expansion.</p><h3 id=\"from-fear-to-mastery\"><strong>From Fear to Mastery</strong></h3><p>The defining psychological shift of the Planetary Phase Shift is from fear of limits to mastery of feedbacks. Civilisations collapse when they treat boundaries as obstacles to overcome through force; they renew when they use boundaries as signals for optimisation, guides for elegant adaptation, opportunities for innovation within constraints rather than despite them.</p><p>Britain pioneered the industrial age by mastering coal energy&#x2014;not by discovering it first but by developing the social, technical, and financial systems to deploy it at scale. It can pioneer the regenerative age by mastering solar abundance&#x2014;not through technological breakthrough alone but through systemic integration of distributed&#xa0;generation, circular materials, adaptive governance, and prosperity redefined around well-being rather than throughput.</p><p>The data already illuminate the path: exponential learning curves in renewables, falling costs, rising energy returns, deployment acceleration. But data alone are insufficient. Britain must update its organising story from mastery over nature to partnership with it, from growth against limits to growth through feedback, from extraction to regeneration, from accumulation to circulation, from throughput speed to coherence depth.</p><p>This is not naive utopianism but thermodynamic realism. The fossil age is ending. The question is whether Britain navigates the transition deliberately, building the regenerative civilisation that can succeed within planetary boundaries, or whether it exhausts its remaining energy and capital attempting futile restoration until chaotic collapse forces reorganisation under catastrophic rather than managed conditions.</p><p>Every back-loop is a test of consciousness. Either we expend the last surplus defending the old order&#x2014;megaprojects that destroy capital, fossil subsidies that accelerate decline, bureaucratic hierarchies that obstruct adaptation&#x2014;or we channel remaining resources into building the architecture of renewal: distributed energy abundance, adaptive urban form, polycentric governance, regenerative economics.</p><p>Britain faces a civilisational choice. The evidence presented here demonstrates that restoration is thermodynamically impossible while reorganisation is economically viable. The only remaining question is whether the political will exists to choose the thermodynamically possible over the nostalgically desired, to build for the civilisation that can succeed rather than attempting to resurrect the one that cannot.</p><p>History casts Britain in this role before. The challenge now is not to rebuild the industrial civilisation it launched but to build the regenerative civilisation that will succeed it&#x2014;one measuring success not by material throughput but by the coherence between people, technology, and the living Earth. That is how Britain escapes stagnation: not by tightening the old machine but by learning to evolve.</p><h3 id=\"references\"><strong>References</strong></h3><p>Ahmed, N.

        "full_content": "Introduction In the spring and summer of 2023, the Supreme Court found itself floating amidst a sea of controversy. After reports circulated that Justice Thomas had received numerous undisclosed gifts from billionaire megadonor Harlan Crow, many began to question the ethics of the Justices. [1] After months of backlash and public pressure, the Court took the unprecedented step of publishing the Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States (\u201cCode\u201d)\u2014the first ethics code in the Court\u2019s history. [2] However, the Code hardly brought an end to the Court\u2019s ethics crisis. Opening with a noticeably defensive tone, the Code purports to outline the rules and principles governing the Justices\u2019 conduct while asserting that the Justices have always adhered to such ideals. [3] The Code claims to merely clarify a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d that the Justices were unbound by any rules of ethics. [4] It also indicates no recognition of wrongdoing for any of the controversies that gave rise to the document, nor does the Code even mention any of them. [5] However, by far the most notable feature of the Code is its lack of any kind of enforcement mechanism. [6] Critics have questioned the effectiveness of an ethics code that provides no means of enforcing itself. [7] Many argue that the lack of an enforcement mechanism renders the Code non-binding and thus functionally useless. [8] However, others dismiss the need for such regulation, arguing that calls for external constraints are motivated by pure partisan animus against the conservative Justices. [9] What this debate has lacked, however, is a research-based analysis of how well the Justices could realistically be expected to police their own ethics. Lacking in evidentiary support, opinions about the Code and the Court\u2019s ability to enforce it have remained largely speculative. Such conjectural debate about the Code is then vulnerable to entrenchment along the battle lines of political tribalism and debaters\u2019 innate optimism (or pessimism) concerning the Justices\u2019 capacity to self-regulate. A more objective analysis is warranted. This Note will accordingly contribute a behavioral science perspective to this debate. Empirical studies demonstrate how the influence of cognitive biases on the Justices\u2019 decision-making can compromise their ability to fairly and impartially police their own ethics. In the face of such vulnerability to bias and the existence of incentives encouraging exemption from self-regulation, some mechanism of external enforcement is necessary. Furthermore, in areas where enforcement may be unconstitutional, behavioral science can help inform debiasing strategies to help Justices remain more impartial in their self-evaluation. This Note thus seeks to provide a research-based understanding of the Court\u2019s ethics vulnerabilities and encourages policy makers to pursue stricter ethics enforcement. This Note proceeds as follows. Part I explores the state of Supreme Court ethics following the promulgation of the Code by highlighting its gaps and failures. Part II examines the institutional and personal incentives that compromise the Justices\u2019 ability to impartially evaluate their own conduct. Part III draws on behavioral science research to demonstrate how cognitive biases further undermine the feasibility of self-enforcement. Part IV examines potential solutions by arguing for constitutionally viable reforms and debiasing strategies where direct regulation is unavailable. I. The SCOTUS Code After months of backlash in response to numerous ethics scandals, the Supreme Court promulgated a code of ethics for the first time in its history on November 13, 2023. [10] The Code (rather defensively) declared in its introduction that \u201c[t]he absence of a Code . . . has led in recent years to the misunderstanding that the Justices of this Court, unlike all other jurists in this country, regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethics rules.\u201d [11] The Court further asserted that the principles of the Code are \u201cnot new\u201d and the Code \u201clargely represents a codification of principles that [the Court] ha[d] long regarded as governing [its] conduct.\u201d [12] Like previous attempts to regulate the Court\u2019s ethics, the Code leaves much to be desired. Generally, it purports to imitate the code of conduct that applies to lower court judges, [13] observable through the Code\u2019s use of similar restrictions on partisan influence [14] and recusals. [15] However, the Code deviates from the lower courts\u2019 ethics framework in several important ways. For example, lower court judges are required not to \u201clend[] the prestige of judicial office to advance the private interests of the judges or others.\u201d [16] Meanwhile, the Justices of the Supreme Court are merely advised not to do so knowingly , a significant loophole. [17] Further, the Code is riddled with uses of \u201cshould\u201d and \u201cshould not\u201d rather than \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cshall not,\u201d a crucial softening of words that can nullify such \u201crules.\u201d [18] The Code also provides less-than-ideal restrictions on behaviors related to the controversies of 2023 that gave rise to its existence. Regarding improper outside influences on the Justices, the Code states that \u201c[a] Justice should not allow family, social, political, financial, or other relationships to influence official conduct or judgment.\u201d [19] Additionally, the Code provides that the Justices should \u201cneither knowingly lend the prestige of the judicial office to advance the private interests of the Justice or others nor knowingly convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the Justice.\u201d [20] The pivotal words here are, of course, \u201cinfluence\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d; so long as the Justices can claim that they were not influenced by luxury vacations, yacht trips, hunting expeditions, portrait funds, and private school tuitions, their acceptance of such gifts apparently falls outside the restriction. [21] Moreover, the Justices can claim ignorance\u2014that they did not knowingly give the impression they were influenced. But, as inadequate as they are, these provisions are hardly the greatest failure of the Code. The most troublesome question presented by the Code is the issue of who gets to interpret and enforce its loophole-ridden, ambiguous standards. Absent a formal enforcement mechanism, the power to enforce the Code currently lies in the hands of the Justices\u2014the very individuals the Code is attempting to restrain. Was Justice Thomas influenced by the lavish gifts of Harlan Crow? [22] It is up to Justice Thomas to decide, as is the matter of whether anything should be done in response. The question then remains: How reliably can Justice Thomas evaluate his own behavior? II. Incentives Working Against Impartial Self-Enforcement Before turning to the cognitive biases that make impartial self-regulation implausible, it is necessary to examine the incentives already in existence whenever a Justice must evaluate their own conduct. A brief analysis of such incentives reveals both institutional and personal forces that undermine impartial self-policing. The Justices have strong motives to protect both the Court\u2019s institutional legitimacy and their own reputations. Admitting to having committed an ethics violation risks upending both of those things. The motivation to avoid public embarrassment and preserve reputation is only magnified in a forum as public as the Supreme Court. Further, the Justices (presumably) have a natural desire to view themselves as principled and ethical. [23] This desire incentivizes a self-policing actor to try and avoid shame rather than admit error. Material incentives only deepen the problem. Financial and personal benefits (like those at issue in the cases of Justices Thomas and Alito) disincentivize the admission of wrongdoing. To concede impropriety in such situations would mean forfeiting tangible, monetary benefits and potentially the relationships that provide them. Similar dynamics can arise in recusal decisions: Justices may hesitate to step aside from a case simply to preserve influence over an outcome they care about. We need not view this as some particularly egregious sin, either; it is a predictable desire for a self-interested human being to have. Our legal system recognizes how such pressures can distort the judgments of decision-makers; hence lawyers and lower court judges alike are subject to external ethics enforcement for precisely this reason. [24] Yet the Supreme Court stands alone in its freedom from meaningful ethics oversight when personal interests are at issue. As discussed further in Part IV, impeachment, while theoretically available, is neither a procedurally realistic nor a proportionate response to most ethics issues. Accordingly, in practice, the Justices operate without any credible external check, and the Code certainly did not create one. Instead, the absence of such enforcement leaves us with nothing but faith. Those who live under the Court\u2019s authority can only hope that the Justices are both virtuous enough and objective enough to police their own ethics violations in an impartial manner. But is such faith warranted? Can we reasonably expect a self-regulating actor to rule against their own interests in the absence of meaningful ethics constraints? Unfortunately, as shown in the next section, behavioral research gives us little reason to believe in such superhuman impartiality. The research is clear: Like all human beings, the Justices are vulnerable to subconscious biases that skew their decision-making towards their preferred outcomes. III. The Justices\u2019 Vulnerability to Cognitive Bias This Part will explore the relevant behavioral science literature regarding self-regulated ethics. It will demonstrate that the Justices, like all actors, are vulnerable to subconscious cognitive biases that compromise their ability to impartially police their own ethics. Subpart A will introduce the cognitive bias of motivated cognition and its prevalence among laypersons. Subpart B will examine the bias\u2019s effect on legally trained actors. Subpart C will present research studying the bias\u2019s presence among lower court judges and then extend that research to the Justices. Subpart D will analyze how motivated cognition interacts with preexisting incentives to undermine objective self-regulation. A. An Illustration of Motivated Cognition The cognitive bias posing the greatest threat to impartiality in self-policed ethics is known as motivated cognition , or motivated reasoning. The theory of motivated cognition explains that when decision-makers have a preference regarding the outcome of an evaluative decision, they are more likely to arrive at a conclusion that leads to their preferred outcome by engaging in biased cognitive processes. [25] In short, the decision-maker is biased towards reaching the outcome they desire. For example, consider a case in which a passionate fan of a football team evaluates a highly uncertain play. Imagine it is unclear\u2014even after reviewing slow-motion replay\u2014whether the team\u2019s receiver was in or out of bounds while catching a pass that, if caught in bounds, would win the game for the team. In the face of such uncertainty, the fan\u2019s motivation to see the team win will tend to skew the evaluation towards the fan\u2019s preferred outcome\u2014that the catch was made in bounds. A 1954 study of a Dartmouth\u2013Princeton football game created an experiment similar to this hypothetical. [26] This study had students from both schools watch a film of a football game and asked each student to count the number of rule violations committed by each team. [27] The Dartmouth students reported that each team committed approximately the same number of violations. [28] In contrast, the Princeton students reported twice as many violations from the Dartmouth team in comparison to the Princeton team. [29] These different conclusions illustrate how motivated cognition biases decision-makers towards their preferred outcomes, even when those conclusions are drawn from the same set of facts. Motivated cognition is far-reaching; it affects judgments concerning the self, others, and events. [30] It also operates subconsciously, affecting everything from how actors selectively recall information [31] to how they visually process their environment. [32] Most importantly, the bias exists under an \u201cillusion of objectivity,\u201d tricking actors into believing they remain impartial despite the influence of their subconscious motivations. [33] This illusion thus puts motivated cognition in a potent position to compromise the work of legal decision-makers\u2014the bias skews their evaluations while they nevertheless believe they are operating with the kind of objectivity that our legal system demands. A plethora of studies have documented the influence of motivated cognition when laypeople are asked to make legal decisions. One series of experiments showed that when a harmful act occurs, people tend to assign responsibility to an actor who evokes a negative emotional response\u2014even if that response is legally irrelevant to the incident. [34] Participants were more likely to view a speeding driver as the cause of an accident (over other factors, such as an oil spill) if the driver was speeding home to hide a vial of cocaine than if he was speeding home to hide a surprise anniversary gift. [35] Here, the evaluator\u2019s otherwise rational assessment of culpability was shifted by emotional bias against the transgressor. Another study presented participants with a case of a woman whose dogs mauled a child to death. If the woman was described as having \u201cbad\u201d character (antisocial tendencies and physically unhealthy habits) she was assigned more blame and intentionality in the child\u2019s death than if she was described as having \u201cgood\u201d character (sociable tendencies and physically healthy habits), even though her character should have no logical bearing on the evaluation. [36] B. Motivated Cognition Among Legally Trained Actors Further studies have demonstrated that having legal training does not necessarily insulate an actor from the effects of motivated cognition. One experiment asked law students to determine whether a proposed change in a tax rate violated a state constitution. [37] Half of the students were told the change raised taxes, while the other half were told it lowered them. [38] The students were provided with identical materials regarding the relevant precedents and the new law\u2019s legislative history. [39] The result was that the students\u2019 evaluations tended to match their policy preferences; politically liberal law students were more likely to overturn the law if it lowered taxes, while conservative students were more likely to do so if it increased taxes. [40] Despite their legal training, these law students fell victim to cognitive bias. At least one study has shown that legal training may even make a person more vulnerable to motivated cognition than laypersons. This experiment studied the effects of motivated cognition on law students and undergraduates by asking them to evaluate how similar a hypothetical discrimination case was to a reference case, Boy Scouts of America v. Dale . [41] In Boy Scouts , the Supreme Court held that the Boy Scouts of America could discriminate against prospective members seeking to join the organization for being gay. [42] Again, both the law students and undergraduates were found to exhibit motivated reasoning along policy preference lines. If Boy Scouts supported students\u2019 preferred position regarding discrimination, they were more likely to view it as similar and therefore controlling with regard to the hypothetical case. [43] If Boy Scouts contrasted with students\u2019 preferred position, they were more likely to find it dissimilar to the hypothetical case at issue. [44] Most notably, the study found that the motivated cognition effect was \u201cstronger and more consistent\u201d in the law student participants than in the college students\u2014a finding that undermines hopes that legal training can insulate against the bias. [45] One possible explanation for this is that legal training better equips an actor to rationalize their policy-motivated decisions. More familiar with the nuances of evaluating facts and case law, legally trained actors can perhaps better marshal information that supports their preferred positions and create more innovative justifications for how it does so. C. Motivated Cognition Within the Judiciary Judges do not appear to be exempt from motivated cognition either. One experiment demonstrated this by studying the influence of character evidence on judicial decision-making. [46] The researchers presented a group of judges with a hypothetical products liability case and asked them to award damages to the plaintiff. [47] The judges were split into two groups, one being exposed to evidence about the plaintiff\u2019s prior criminal history (despite it having no bearing on the case) and the other being shielded from such information. [48] Even though the majority of the judges who were exposed to the information declined to admit it into evidence, the exposed judges still awarded the plaintiff an average of 12% less in damages (about $93,000) than the judges who had not received the criminal history information. [49] One explanation for this result is the animus created against the plaintiff by learning about the plaintiff\u2019s criminal history\u2014an animus mobilized by motivated cognition and expressed in lesser damages awards. The researchers found similar influences on judges from other generally inadmissible evidence, such as a rape victim\u2019s past sexual history [50] or offers made during a settlement conference. [51] The experimenters ultimately concluded that the judges were generally unable to disregard such inadmissible information when making their decisions. [52] In the face of motivating and prejudicial evidence, the judges, like laypersons and law students, fell victim to their cognitive biases. Another study found additional evidence of motivated cognition influencing judges\u2019 tendencies to admit or refuse the use of social science evidence in death penalty cases. [53] In this study, judges and law students were given information about two death penalty cases in which the Supreme Court examined the admissibility of social science research. [54] Participants were then asked, among other things, to determine if such evidence should be admitted or excluded and how much weight it should be given. [55] After viewing the materials, the participants were asked about their responses as well as their own views on the death penalty. [56] The researchers found that both the judges and students considered the social science evidence to be more relevant and therefore admissible when the evidence supported their own views on the death penalty than when it contrasted with their views. [57] Such an alignment of personal opinion and legal evaluation provides a clear example of motivated cognition in action\u2014the judges elected to ignore or accept factual information in order to support their preferred evaluative outcome. Worse yet, the researchers found a deepening of the \u201cillusion of objectivity\u201d in their results: The judges were more confident than the law students that other actors would agree with their reasoning. [58] This occurred despite there being greater variability between the judges\u2019 ratings than between the law students\u2019. [59] Even though they had more legal training and experience, the judges\u2019 illusion of objectivity had been exacerbated, which ironically resulted in more subjective decision-making. [60] It is thus clear that despite their high status and legal expertise, judges are not free from the reins of cognitive bias in their decision-making. While there may be some variation in the degree to which judges are affected by such biases compared to law students or laypersons, there is no evidence to suggest judges are meaningfully resistant to motivated cognition. [61] The most natural, albeit unconformable, conclusion to be drawn from these findings is that, like all other legal actors, Supreme Court Justices are also vulnerable to motivated cognition. After an examination of the relevant behavioral science literature, there is little reason to believe that the Justices would be immune from motivated cognition. If neither legal training nor a position within the judiciary can confer on individuals a meaningful ability to mitigate motivated cognition, why would being on the Supreme Court provide some unique shield against it? If anything, being on the highest court in the nation might worsen vulnerabilities to motivated cognition in some ways. The experiments previously discussed indicate that the negative effects of motivated cognition may be exacerbated by one\u2019s accrual of legal experience. Legal training augments the effects of motivated cognition in law students relative to laypersons. [62] Further, judges were more confident than law students in the objective validity of their decisions regarding the admission of social science research, despite there being greater variability among the judges\u2019 decisions. [63] These findings could evidence a general pattern of increased vulnerability\u2014or, at least, one\u2019s perceived immunity\u2014to motivated cognition the more legal experience one has. Ultimately, the exact extent to which the Justices of the Supreme Court are affected by motivated cognition and other biases is difficult to prove without direct examination of the Justices themselves. However, the existing evidence fails to indicate that the Justices would be uniquely exempt from the influence of the far-reaching, deep-rooted bias of motivated cognition. Until science proves otherwise, the Justices of the Supreme Court should be considered at least as vulnerable to the effects of motivated cognition as any other legal actor. D. How Motivated Cognition Compromises the Court\u2019s Ethics Regulation In light of the research demonstrating motivated cognition\u2019s influence on legal actors, it is easy to see how motivated cognition could skew Justices\u2019 evaluation of their own ethics. Like any legal judgment, ethics enforcement requires the decision-maker to make an evaluative decision that provides a ready opportunity for motivated cognition to bias the judgment. For example, consider the Code\u2019s treatment of compensation and reimbursement. The Code forbids the Justices from accepting payments that appear \u201cimproper,\u201d a term left without a definition. [64] One must then evaluate what \u201cimproper\u201d means: What does impropriety look like? What makes a payment cross the threshold from \u201cproper\u201d to \u201cimproper?\u201d Are luxury gifts from a billionaire megadonor with deep partisan ties \u201cimproper?\u201d These are substantive, complex questions, the answers to which could populate an entire body of case law. Unfortunately, when the policing of a standard like this is left to the person allegedly transgressing that standard, motivated cognition begins to influence the evaluation; actors\u2019 incentive to view themselves as ethical will command some level of influence over their decision-making. [65] Desires to protect the institutional legitimacy of the Court, as well as to protect the actor\u2019s personal and material interests, also provide incentives which motivated cognition then manifests into biased decision-making. Self-evaluating actors will accordingly, to some degree, rationalize ways to interpret and apply a rule to avoid conceding their own violation of it. In turn, a Justice might rationalize the receipt of a luxurious private jet flight to a speech as a \u201cproper\u201d travel accommodation, dismissing the possibility that the benefactor sought to purchase the Justice\u2019s influence. This tendency parallels the example of the football fans tasked with evaluating their team\u2019s rule violations; even if the fans pledge to do so impartially, their subconscious preference for their team will tend to skew their evaluation towards the outcome that promotes their team\u2019s victory. [66] If we accept the research indicating the vulnerability of legal actors to motivated cognition, we would be deluding ourselves to believe the Justices of the Supreme Court possess some exceptional resistance to it while facing no realistic threat of external enforcement. In light of this, the need for binding ethics reform on the court becomes clear. IV. Solutions This section will discuss potential ethics reforms in light of this need for external enforcement. Subpart A discusses impeachment and why it is inadequate as a sole means of ethics regulation. Subpart B briefly addresses the constitutional question surrounding ethics reform and why certain proposals should be pursued in spite of potential constitutional barriers. Subpart C presents a list of potential solutions that implement some form of external enforcement. Subpart D presents debiasing strategies supported by behavioral science for contexts in which direct enforcement is likely unconstitutional. A. On Impeachment Opponents of an external ethics enforcement mechanism might look towards the impeachment power as a sufficient solution for ethics violations. [67] However, impeachment is too procedurally burdensome to be practically employed and inappropriately punitive for many lesser ethics violations. This renders impeachment functionally non-existent as an enforcement mechanism. No Supreme Court Justice has ever been impeached and removed by Congress. [68] Justice Chase was impeached in 1804 on charges of partisanship, but he was acquitted by the Senate. [69] The last attempted use of the impeachment power was against Justice Fortas in 1969, but impeachment proceedings did not materialize before the Justice\u2019s resignation. [70] Both the initiation and conclusion of impeachment proceedings must clear a high procedural bar. [71] This alone renders impeachment a less-than-ideal approach to ethics enforcement because it poses no probable or procedurally realistic threat to the Justices. Impeachment is also an excessively harsh means of enforcing many kinds of ethics rules. While it may be an appropriate tool for more egregious violations, it is difficult to justify impeachment for the more marginal violations, such as Justice Sotomayor\u2019s staff pressuring event hosts to buy her books as an implicit \u201cprice\u201d for her speaking arrangements. [72] While behaviors such as Justice Sotomayor\u2019s are almost certainly unethical, punishing them with impeachment is hardly proportional to the violation at issue. The problem then is that as long as impeachment remains the sole means of ethics enforcement, lesser violations are either (a) over-punished with a burdensome procedure or (b) unpunished entirely. Both outcomes are undesirable. Therefore, a less punitive and more adaptable solution is needed. B. On the Constitutional Question The question of whether and how Congress can impose external ethics enforcement on the Court (and, if so, to what degree), is complex and remains largely unanswered. [73] Arguably, the separation-of-powers principles implied in the Constitution prevent Congress from enacting any kind of ethics reform for the Court. On the other hand, some propose that Congress has plenty of constitutional avenues available to it in order to deter violations. [74] The Court itself has taken care to avoid answering the question of its ethical regulation by Congress, as the Justices voluntarily adhere to ethics statutes like the Ethics in Government Act (\u201cEGA\u201d) and Ethics Reform Act while simultaneously implying that they are not actually required to do so. [75] However, the Court\u2019s voluntary compliance arguably supports the theory that Congress can indeed police the Court\u2019s ethics. Furthermore, the separation-of-powers doctrine is not necessarily implicated by all regulation of federal judges. Restrictions on extrajudicial activity (such as the receipt of large donations) arguably do not enter the territory of the Court\u2019s judicial function. Congress has successfully walked the constitutional line between the legislative and judicial powers by regulating, for example, the number of Justices on the Court, [76] constraints on the Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, [77] and even the outcome of a pending case via last-minute legislation. [78] If such legislative constraints on the Court are constitutional, then surely restrictions on extrajudicial conduct would be constitutionally permissible. A comprehensive analysis of Congress\u2019 constitutional capacity to regulate Supreme Court Justices\u2019 conduct is beyond the scope of this Note, as is any conjecture with regard to how the Court might respond to such legislation. Regardless, the answers to those inquiries have little bearing on the main point of this Note\u2014that stricter ethics enforcement must be pursued to the extent our constitutional structure allows, whatever that extent may be. In this pursuit, Congress should not be afraid to test boundaries in order to expedite the determination of these separation-of-powers questions. The sooner such questions are answered, the sooner that Congress can identify which avenues are available for enacting effective, constitutionally compliant reforms. C. Solutions for Establishing an External Enforcement Mechanism 1. Criminal and Civil Liability for Ethics Violations Justices are almost certainly bound by the same framework of criminal laws to which the rest of the nation must adhere. If Justice Alito runs a stop sign on his way to oral arguments, he must submit to the legal consequences (in this case, pay a traffic fine) like everyone else. [79] Why not extend similar liability to ethics violations? As it stands, Congress may already have the ability to do this in certain circumstances. Congress has a built-in mechanism to enforce the Ethics in Government Act via both criminal and civil liability. The EGA provides in essence that judicial officers who \u201cwillfully fail to file or falsify their financial disclosure statements are subject to referral to the Attorney General and may face civil penalties.\u201d [80] Upon referral, the Attorney General may bring civil action in order to assess a civil penalty (up to $50,000) [81] or even imprison a violator for up to one year. [82] Provided that the Court is constitutionally within the purview of the EGA, this referral mechanism would apply to the Justices. An EGA referral is likely the best starting point for Congress to begin to exert some degree of control over the Court\u2019s ethics violations. First, the constitutionality of such a referral is plausible since a resulting action would only concern extrajudicial activity, not the Court\u2019s judicial function. [83] Application of the EGA to the Court would allow Congress to meaningfully address ethics violations while avoiding the procedural burdens of alternatives like impeachment. The EGA could therefore prove to be a powerful deterrence tool, as it would arm Congress with a reliable way to review and punish extrajudicial misconduct. 2. Withholding Appropriations Some have suggested that Congress could utilize its power of the purse to deter ethics violations by the Justices. [84] Senator Chris Van Hollen, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee, proposed that the Senate could leverage its influence over the Court\u2019s budget in order to coerce the Court to adhere to desired ethics standards. [85] For example, if a Justice failed to disclose a received gift in their annual reports, the Senate could sanction the Court for an amount appropriate for such a violation. While this would enable responsive punishment for ethics violations, it runs the risk of being overly punitive, similar to impeachment. An excessive withholding of appropriations would cripple the Court\u2019s ability to function, an obviously undesirable outcome. Withholding would thus have to be used sparingly to avoid such a result. In light of this, criminal and civil liability for ethics violations are likely the more adaptable, and therefore better, means of enforcement. However, the withholding of appropriations could nonetheless remain a useful enforcement tool if such alternatives are held unconstitutional. D. Debiasing Strategies in the Face of Constitutional Barriers 3. Public Recusal Decisions A Justice\u2019s refusal to recuse themselves from a case creating a conflict of interest presents one of the more difficult ethical issues for an external body to regulate. While 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 already demands the Justices\u2019 recusal in certain situations, Congress almost certainly lacks the authority to directly regulate the Justices\u2019 decisions over this matter because doing so would implicate the Court\u2019s judicial function. [86] Professor Louis Virelli has argued that this provides reason for Congress to set aside disqualification regulations and instead act on other areas of enforcement where constitutional authority is more apparent. [87] However, Virelli\u2019s advice is perhaps unnecessary because there may be action Congress can still take regarding recusals. Congress could instead look to debiasing strategies to help fight against the effects of motivated cognition. [88] The proposed Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act of 2023 offered a regulatory solution requiring the Justices to author written opinions regarding their decisions not to recuse from a case. [89] The regulation would operate as follows: First, a litigant could request a written explanation relating to a Justice\u2019s recusal decision. [90] Then, the Judicial Conference would issue an advisory opinion addressing whether the Justice ought to be disqualified. [91] If the Judicial Conference recommends disqualification, the Justice would then be required to provide a public explanation of the recusal decision. [92] Professor Avani Mehta Sood believes such a process can work to debias legal decision-makers. Sood postulates that \u201creining in\u201d motivated cognition among legal actors \u201cmight [require] drawing attention to inadvertently and inappropriately motivating factors.\u201d [93] Professor Feldman provided a similar endorsement, hypothesizing that corporate and government decision-makers could use written declarations of conflicts to force the regulated actors to confront their conflicts. [94] Here, the Judicial Conference\u2019s advisory opinion could serve this debiasing purpose. By publicly and explicitly highlighting a potential conflict of interest, the Judicial Conference puts the Justice on notice as to possibly motivating (i.e., biasing) factors influencing the Justice\u2019s decision-making. This notice, in turn, could help reduce the biasing effects of such factors by forcing the Justice to bring such previously subconscious motivations into the forefront of his or her conscious (and public) reasoning. [95] 4. Eliminating Ambiguities As a general matter, Congress (and the Justices) should seek to eliminate ambiguities in judicial ethics statutes and codes as much as possible. While eliminating all instances of ambiguity is an impossible task, aspiring to this end will nevertheless minimize opportunities for biased readings or motivated violations of ethics rules. Professor Feldman highlights how ambiguity can \u201cenable[] people who view themselves as moral to convince themselves that unethical behavior is ethical.\u201d [96] Feldman accordingly promotes more explicit language in ethics codes. [97] Feldman presents the example of a company\u2019s ethics code using the specific term \u201cemployees\u201d instead of the more general \u201cwe\u201d; even this small change helped remind employees that they were bound by the code. [98] In the realm of judicial ethics, providing more clear definitions as to what constitutes an \u201cimproper\u201d relationship or the types of gifts that must be disclosed would help eliminate areas where motivated cognition can influence a self-policing Justice. The less room a code or statute provides for textual interpretation, the less room there is for bias to inform the interpretation. [99] Conclusion This Note provides empirical support for the contention that the Court cannot impartially police its own ethics. The scientific understanding of motivated cognition among legal decision-makers indicates that the Justices of the Supreme Court are not exempt from motivated cognition or other threats to their impartiality. Motivated cognition leads individuals, especially those with legal training, to rationalize their own biased decisions and unethical behavior. Accordingly, the Supreme Court\u2019s Code fails to meaningfully regulate the Justices\u2019 behavior because it entrusts to the Justices the power to enforce the Code against themselves and thereby invites the Justices to rationalize their behavior, all while believing such rationalizations are objective. In light of this, lawmakers should remain pessimistic about the Justices\u2019 ability to self-regulate and pursue some form of external enforcement. At the same time, it is important to note that the preceding analysis does not mean to assign moral blame to any Justice. To do so would not only be improper and unhelpful but is also beside the point of this Note. The problem does not lie with a few \u201cbad apples\u201d or instances of bad behavior but instead with the nature of an institution that asks its own members to regulate conduct that implicates their material and institutional interests. Congress should therefore continue to pursue ethics reform and protect bills such as the Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act from fading into obscurity while stuck in committee. [100] What remains of the political momentum from the 2023 ethics crisis should be capitalized on before the public\u2019s attention is lost. The outcry resulting from that crisis led the Court to adopt its Code, an unprecedented step in the Court\u2019s history. Now, continued pressure is necessary to bring about meaningful ethics reform at the Court. .

        "raw_html": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In the spring and summer of 2023, the Supreme Court found itself floating amidst a sea of controversy. After reports circulated that Justice Thomas had received numerous undisclosed gifts from billionaire megadonor Harlan Crow, many began to question the ethics of the Justices.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-1\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup> After months of backlash and public pressure, the Court took the unprecedented step of publishing the Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States (\u201cCode\u201d)\u2014the first ethics code in the Court\u2019s history.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-2\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>However, the Code hardly brought an end to the Court\u2019s ethics crisis. Opening with a noticeably defensive tone, the Code purports to outline the rules and principles governing the Justices\u2019 conduct while asserting that the Justices have always adhered to such ideals.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-3\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-3\">[3]</a></sup> The Code claims to merely clarify a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d that the Justices were unbound by any rules of ethics.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-4\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-4\">[4]</a></sup> It also indicates no recognition of wrongdoing for any of the controversies that gave rise to the document, nor does the Code even mention any of them.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-5\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-5\">[5]</a></sup> However, by far the most notable feature of the Code is its lack of any kind of enforcement mechanism.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-6\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Critics have questioned the effectiveness of an ethics code that provides no means of enforcing itself.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-7\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-7\">[7]</a></sup> Many argue that the lack of an enforcement mechanism renders the Code non-binding and thus functionally useless.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-8\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-8\">[8]</a></sup> However, others dismiss the need for such regulation, arguing that calls for external constraints are motivated by pure partisan animus against the conservative Justices.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-9\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-9\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n<p>What this debate has lacked, however, is a research-based analysis of how well the Justices could realistically be expected to police their own ethics. Lacking in evidentiary support, opinions about the Code and the Court\u2019s ability to enforce it have remained largely speculative. Such conjectural debate about the Code is then vulnerable to entrenchment along the battle lines of political tribalism and debaters\u2019 innate optimism (or pessimism) concerning the Justices\u2019 capacity to self-regulate. A more objective analysis is warranted.</p>\n<p>This Note will accordingly contribute a behavioral science perspective to this debate. Empirical studies demonstrate how the influence of cognitive biases on the Justices\u2019 decision-making can compromise their ability to fairly and impartially police their own ethics. In the face of such vulnerability to bias and the existence of incentives encouraging exemption from self-regulation, some mechanism of external enforcement is necessary. Furthermore, in areas where enforcement may be unconstitutional, behavioral science can help inform debiasing strategies to help Justices remain more impartial in their self-evaluation. This Note thus seeks to provide a research-based understanding of the Court\u2019s ethics vulnerabilities and encourages policy makers to pursue stricter ethics enforcement.</p>\n<p>This Note proceeds as follows. Part I explores the state of Supreme Court ethics following the promulgation of the Code by highlighting its gaps and failures. Part II examines the institutional and personal incentives that compromise the Justices\u2019 ability to impartially evaluate their own conduct. Part III draws on behavioral science research to demonstrate how cognitive biases further undermine the feasibility of self-enforcement. Part IV examines potential solutions by arguing for constitutionally viable reforms and debiasing strategies where direct regulation is unavailable.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215056230\"></a><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215124424\"></a><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215124477\"></a>I. The SCOTUS Code</h2>\n<p>After months of backlash in response to numerous ethics scandals, the Supreme Court promulgated a code of ethics for the first time in its history on November 13, 2023.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-10\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-10\">[10]</a></sup> The Code (rather defensively) declared in its introduction that \u201c[t]he absence of a Code . . . has led in recent years to the <em>misunderstanding</em> that the Justices of this Court, unlike all other jurists in this country, regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethics rules.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-11\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-11\">[11]</a></sup> The Court further asserted that the principles of the Code are \u201cnot new\u201d and the Code \u201clargely represents a codification of principles that [the Court] ha[d] long regarded as governing [its] conduct.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-12\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-12\">[12]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Like previous attempts to regulate the Court\u2019s ethics, the Code leaves much to be desired. Generally, it purports to imitate the code of conduct that applies to lower court judges,<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-13\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-13\">[13]</a></sup> observable through the Code\u2019s use of similar restrictions on partisan influence<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-14\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-14\">[14]</a></sup> and recusals.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-15\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-15\">[15]</a></sup> However, the Code deviates from the lower courts\u2019 ethics framework in several important ways. For example, lower court judges are required not to \u201clend[] the prestige of judicial office to advance the private interests of the judges or others.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-16\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-16\">[16]</a></sup> Meanwhile, the Justices of the Supreme Court are merely advised not to do so <em>knowingly</em>, a significant loophole.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-17\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-17\">[17]</a></sup> Further, the Code is riddled with uses of \u201cshould\u201d and \u201cshould not\u201d rather than \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cshall not,\u201d a crucial softening of words that can nullify such \u201crules.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-18\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-18\">[18]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Code also provides less-than-ideal restrictions on behaviors related to the controversies of 2023 that gave rise to its existence. Regarding improper outside influences on the Justices, the Code states that \u201c[a] Justice should not allow family, social, political, financial, or other relationships to influence official conduct or judgment.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-19\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-19\">[19]</a></sup> Additionally, the Code provides that the Justices should \u201cneither knowingly lend the prestige of the judicial office to advance the private interests of the Justice or others nor <em>knowingly</em> convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the Justice.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-20\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-20\">[20]</a></sup> The pivotal words here are, of course, \u201cinfluence\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d; so long as the Justices can claim that they were not <em>influenced</em> by luxury vacations, yacht trips, hunting expeditions, portrait funds, and private school tuitions, their acceptance of such gifts apparently falls outside the restriction.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-21\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-21\">[21]</a></sup> Moreover, the Justices can claim ignorance\u2014that they did not <em>knowingly</em> give the impression they were influenced.</p>\n<p>But, as inadequate as they are, these provisions are hardly the greatest failure of the Code. The most troublesome question presented by the Code is the issue of <em>who</em> gets to interpret and enforce its loophole-ridden, ambiguous standards. Absent a formal enforcement mechanism, the power to enforce the Code currently lies in the hands of the Justices\u2014the very individuals the Code is attempting to restrain. Was Justice Thomas<em> influenced</em> by the lavish gifts of Harlan Crow?<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-22\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-22\">[22]</a></sup> It is up to Justice Thomas to decide, as is the matter of whether anything should be done in response. The question then remains: How reliably can Justice Thomas evaluate his own behavior?</p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215056231\"></a><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215124425\"></a><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215124478\"></a>\u00a0II. Incentives Working Against Impartial Self-Enforcement</h2>\n<p>Before turning to the cognitive biases that make impartial self-regulation implausible, it is necessary to examine the incentives already in existence whenever a Justice must evaluate their own conduct. A brief analysis of such incentives reveals both institutional and personal forces that undermine impartial self-policing.</p>\n<p>The Justices have strong motives to protect both the Court\u2019s institutional legitimacy and their own reputations. Admitting to having committed an ethics violation risks upending both of those things. The motivation to avoid public embarrassment and preserve reputation is only magnified in a forum as public as the Supreme Court. Further, the Justices (presumably) have a natural desire to view themselves as principled and ethical.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-23\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-23\">[23]</a></sup> This desire incentivizes a self-policing actor to try and avoid shame rather than admit error.</p>\n<p>Material incentives only deepen the problem. Financial and personal benefits (like those at issue in the cases of Justices Thomas and Alito) disincentivize the admission of wrongdoing. To concede impropriety in such situations would mean forfeiting tangible, monetary benefits and potentially the relationships that provide them. Similar dynamics can arise in recusal decisions: Justices may hesitate to step aside from a case simply to preserve influence over an outcome they care about. We need not view this as some particularly egregious sin, either; it is a predictable desire for a self-interested human being to have. Our legal system recognizes how such pressures can distort the judgments of decision-makers; hence lawyers and lower court judges alike are subject to external ethics enforcement for precisely this reason.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-24\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-24\">[24]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Yet the Supreme Court stands alone in its freedom from meaningful ethics oversight when personal interests are at issue. As discussed further in Part IV, impeachment, while theoretically available, is neither a procedurally realistic nor a proportionate response to most ethics issues. Accordingly, in practice, the Justices operate without any credible external check, and the Code certainly did not create one. Instead, the absence of such enforcement leaves us with nothing but faith. Those who live under the Court\u2019s authority can only hope that the Justices are both virtuous enough and objective enough to police their own ethics violations in an impartial manner. But is such faith warranted? Can we reasonably expect a self-regulating actor to rule against their own interests in the absence of meaningful ethics constraints? Unfortunately, as shown in the next section, behavioral research gives us little reason to believe in such superhuman impartiality. The research is clear: Like all human beings, the Justices are vulnerable to subconscious biases that skew their decision-making towards their preferred outcomes.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215056232\"></a><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215124426\"></a><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215124479\"></a>\u00a0III. The Justices\u2019 Vulnerability to Cognitive Bias</h2>\n<p>This Part will explore the relevant behavioral science literature regarding self-regulated ethics. It will demonstrate that the Justices, like all actors, are vulnerable to subconscious cognitive biases that compromise their ability to impartially police their own ethics. Subpart A will introduce the cognitive bias of motivated cognition and its prevalence among laypersons. Subpart B will examine the bias\u2019s effect on legally trained actors. Subpart C will present research studying the bias\u2019s presence among lower court judges and then extend that research to the Justices. Subpart D will analyze how motivated cognition interacts with preexisting incentives to undermine objective self-regulation.</p>\n<h3>A. An Illustration of Motivated Cognition</h3>\n<p>The cognitive bias posing the greatest threat to impartiality in self-policed ethics is known as <em>motivated cognition</em>, or motivated reasoning. The theory of motivated cognition explains that when decision-makers have a preference regarding the outcome of an evaluative decision, they are more likely to arrive at a conclusion that leads to their preferred outcome by engaging in biased cognitive processes.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-25\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-25\">[25]</a></sup> In short, the decision-maker is biased towards reaching the outcome they desire.</p>\n<p>For example, consider a case in which a passionate fan of a football team evaluates a highly uncertain play. Imagine it is unclear\u2014even after reviewing slow-motion replay\u2014whether the team\u2019s receiver was in or out of bounds while catching a pass that, if caught in bounds, would win the game for the team. In the face of such uncertainty, the fan\u2019s motivation to see the team win will tend to skew the evaluation towards the fan\u2019s preferred outcome\u2014that the catch was made in bounds.</p>\n<p>A 1954 study of a Dartmouth\u2013Princeton football game created an experiment similar to this hypothetical.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-26\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-26\">[26]</a></sup> This study had students from both schools watch a film of a football game and asked each student to count the number of rule violations committed by each team.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-27\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-27\">[27]</a></sup> The Dartmouth students reported that each team committed approximately the same number of violations.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-28\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-28\">[28]</a></sup> In contrast, the Princeton students reported <em>twice </em>as many violations from the Dartmouth team in comparison to the Princeton team.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-29\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-29\">[29]</a></sup> These different conclusions illustrate how motivated cognition biases decision-makers towards their preferred outcomes, even when those conclusions are drawn from the same set of facts.</p>\n<p>Motivated cognition is far-reaching; it affects judgments concerning the self, others, and events.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-30\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-30\">[30]</a></sup> It also operates subconsciously, affecting everything from how actors selectively recall information<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-31\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-31\">[31]</a></sup> to how they visually process their environment.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-32\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-32\">[32]</a></sup> Most importantly, the bias exists under an \u201cillusion of objectivity,\u201d tricking actors into <em>believing</em> they remain impartial despite the influence of their subconscious motivations.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-33\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-33\">[33]</a></sup> This illusion thus puts motivated cognition in a potent position to compromise the work of legal decision-makers\u2014the bias skews their evaluations while they nevertheless <em>believe </em>they are operating with the kind of objectivity that our legal system demands.</p>\n<p>A plethora of studies have documented the influence of motivated cognition when laypeople are asked to make legal decisions. One series of experiments showed that when a harmful act occurs, people tend to assign responsibility to an actor who evokes a negative emotional response\u2014even if that response is legally irrelevant to the incident.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-34\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-34\">[34]</a></sup> Participants were more likely to view a speeding driver as the cause of an accident (over other factors, such as an oil spill) if the driver was speeding home to hide a vial of cocaine than if he was speeding home to hide a surprise anniversary gift.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-35\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-35\">[35]</a></sup> Here, the evaluator\u2019s otherwise rational assessment of culpability was shifted by emotional bias against the transgressor.</p>\n<p>Another study presented participants with a case of a woman whose dogs mauled a child to death. If the woman was described as having \u201cbad\u201d character (antisocial tendencies and physically unhealthy habits) she was assigned more blame and intentionality in the child\u2019s death than if she was described as having \u201cgood\u201d character (sociable tendencies and physically healthy habits), even though her character should have no logical bearing on the evaluation.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-36\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-36\">[36]</a></sup></p>\n<h3>B. Motivated Cognition Among Legally Trained Actors</h3>\n<p>Further studies have demonstrated that having legal training does not necessarily insulate an actor from the effects of motivated cognition. One experiment asked law students to determine whether a proposed change in a tax rate violated a state constitution.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-37\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-37\">[37]</a></sup> Half of the students were told the change raised taxes, while the other half were told it lowered them.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-38\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-38\">[38]</a></sup> The students were provided with identical materials regarding the relevant precedents and the new law\u2019s legislative history.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-39\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-39\">[39]</a></sup> The result was that the students\u2019 evaluations tended to match their policy preferences; politically liberal law students were more likely to overturn the law if it lowered taxes, while conservative students were more likely to do so if it increased taxes.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-40\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-40\">[40]</a></sup> Despite their legal training, these law students fell victim to cognitive bias.</p>\n<p>At least one study has shown that legal training may even make a person <em>more </em>vulnerable to motivated cognition than laypersons. This experiment studied the effects of motivated cognition on law students and undergraduates by asking them to evaluate how similar a hypothetical discrimination case was to a reference case, <em>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale</em>.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-41\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-41\">[41]</a></sup> In <em>Boy Scouts</em>, the Supreme Court held that the Boy Scouts of America could discriminate against prospective members seeking to join the organization for being gay.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-42\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-42\">[42]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Again, both the law students and undergraduates were found to exhibit motivated reasoning along policy preference lines. If <em>Boy Scouts</em> supported students\u2019 preferred position regarding discrimination, they were more likely to view it as similar and therefore controlling with regard to the hypothetical case.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-43\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-43\">[43]</a></sup> If <em>Boy Scouts </em>contrasted with students\u2019 preferred position, they were more likely to find it dissimilar to the hypothetical case at issue.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-44\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-44\">[44]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Most notably, the study found that the motivated cognition effect was \u201cstronger and more consistent\u201d in the law student participants than in the college students\u2014a finding that undermines hopes that legal training can insulate against the bias.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-45\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-45\">[45]</a></sup> One possible explanation for this is that legal training better equips an actor to rationalize their policy-motivated decisions. More familiar with the nuances of evaluating facts and case law, legally trained actors can perhaps better marshal information that supports their preferred positions and create more innovative justifications for how it does so.</p>\n<h3>C. Motivated Cognition Within the Judiciary</h3>\n<p>Judges do not appear to be exempt from motivated cognition either. One experiment demonstrated this by studying the influence of character evidence on judicial decision-making.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-46\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-46\">[46]</a></sup> The researchers presented a group of judges with a hypothetical products liability case and asked them to award damages to the plaintiff.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-47\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-47\">[47]</a></sup> The judges were split into two groups, one being exposed to evidence about the plaintiff\u2019s prior criminal history (despite it having no bearing on the case) and the other being shielded from such information.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-48\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-48\">[48]</a></sup> Even though the majority of the judges who were exposed to the information declined to admit it into evidence, the exposed judges still awarded the plaintiff an average of 12% less in damages (about $93,000) than the judges who had not received the criminal history information.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-49\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-49\">[49]</a></sup> One explanation for this result is the animus created against the plaintiff by learning about the plaintiff\u2019s criminal history\u2014an animus mobilized by motivated cognition and expressed in lesser damages awards.</p>\n<p>The researchers found similar influences on judges from other generally inadmissible evidence, such as a rape victim\u2019s past sexual history<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-50\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-50\">[50]</a></sup> or offers made during a settlement conference.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-51\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-51\">[51]</a></sup> The experimenters ultimately concluded that the judges were generally unable to disregard such inadmissible information when making their decisions.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-52\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-52\">[52]</a></sup> In the face of motivating and prejudicial evidence, the judges, like laypersons and law students, fell victim to their cognitive biases.</p>\n<p>Another study found additional evidence of motivated cognition influencing judges\u2019 tendencies to admit or refuse the use of social science evidence in death penalty cases.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-53\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-53\">[53]</a></sup> In this study, judges and law students were given information about two death penalty cases in which the Supreme Court examined the admissibility of social science research.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-54\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-54\">[54]</a></sup> Participants were then asked, among other things, to determine if such evidence should be admitted or excluded and how much weight it should be given.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-55\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-55\">[55]</a></sup> After viewing the materials, the participants were asked about their responses as well as their own views on the death penalty.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-56\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-56\">[56]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The researchers found that both the judges and students considered the social science evidence to be more relevant and therefore admissible when the evidence supported their own views on the death penalty than when it contrasted with their views.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-57\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-57\">[57]</a></sup> Such an alignment of personal opinion and legal evaluation provides a clear example of motivated cognition in action\u2014the judges elected to ignore or accept <em>factual information</em> in order to support their preferred evaluative outcome.</p>\n<p>Worse yet, the researchers found a deepening of the \u201cillusion of objectivity\u201d in their results: The judges were <em>more</em> confident than the law students that other actors would agree with their reasoning.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-58\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-58\">[58]</a></sup> This occurred despite there being <em>greater variability</em> between the judges\u2019 ratings than between the law students\u2019.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-59\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-59\">[59]</a></sup> Even though they had more legal training and experience, the judges\u2019 illusion of objectivity had been exacerbated, which ironically resulted in more subjective decision-making.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-60\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-60\">[60]</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is thus clear that despite their high status and legal expertise, judges are not free from the reins of cognitive bias in their decision-making. While there may be some variation in the degree to which judges are affected by such biases compared to law students or laypersons, there is no evidence to suggest judges are meaningfully resistant to motivated cognition.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-61\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-61\">[61]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The most natural, albeit unconformable, conclusion to be drawn from these findings is that, like all other legal actors, Supreme Court Justices are also vulnerable to motivated cognition. After an examination of the relevant behavioral science literature, there is little reason to believe that the Justices would be immune from motivated cognition. If neither legal training nor a position within the judiciary can confer on individuals a meaningful ability to mitigate motivated cognition, why would being on the Supreme Court provide some unique shield against it?</p>\n<p>If anything, being on the highest court in the nation might <em>worsen</em> vulnerabilities to motivated cognition in some ways. The experiments previously discussed indicate that the negative effects of motivated cognition may be exacerbated by one\u2019s accrual of legal experience. Legal training augments the effects of motivated cognition in law students relative to laypersons.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-62\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-62\">[62]</a></sup> Further, judges were more confident than law students in the objective validity of their decisions regarding the admission of social science research, despite there being greater variability among the judges\u2019 decisions.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-63\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-63\">[63]</a></sup> These findings could evidence a general pattern of increased vulnerability\u2014or, at least, one\u2019s perceived immunity\u2014to motivated cognition the more legal experience one has.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the exact extent to which the Justices of the Supreme Court are affected by motivated cognition and other biases is difficult to prove without direct examination of the Justices themselves. However, the existing evidence fails to indicate that the Justices would be uniquely exempt from the influence of the far-reaching, deep-rooted bias of motivated cognition. Until science proves otherwise, the Justices of the Supreme Court should be considered at least as vulnerable to the effects of motivated cognition as any other legal actor.</p>\n<h3>D. How Motivated Cognition Compromises the Court\u2019s Ethics Regulation</h3>\n<p>In light of the research demonstrating motivated cognition\u2019s influence on legal actors, it is easy to see how motivated cognition could skew Justices\u2019 evaluation of their own ethics. Like any legal judgment, ethics enforcement requires the decision-maker to make an evaluative decision that provides a ready opportunity for motivated cognition to bias the judgment. For example, consider the Code\u2019s treatment of compensation and reimbursement. The Code forbids the Justices from accepting payments that appear \u201cimproper,\u201d a term left without a definition.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-64\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-64\">[64]</a></sup> One must then evaluate what \u201cimproper\u201d means: What does impropriety look like? What makes a payment cross the threshold from \u201cproper\u201d to \u201cimproper?\u201d Are luxury gifts from a billionaire megadonor with deep partisan ties \u201cimproper?\u201d These are substantive, complex questions, the answers to which could populate an entire body of case law.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when the policing of a standard like this is left to the person allegedly transgressing that standard, motivated cognition begins to influence the evaluation; actors\u2019 incentive to view themselves as ethical will command some level of influence over their decision-making.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-65\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-65\">[65]</a></sup> Desires to protect the institutional legitimacy of the Court, as well as to protect the actor\u2019s personal and material interests, also provide incentives which motivated cognition then manifests into biased decision-making.</p>\n<p>Self-evaluating actors will accordingly, to some degree, rationalize ways to interpret and apply a rule to avoid conceding their own violation of it. In turn, a Justice might rationalize the receipt of a luxurious private jet flight to a speech as a \u201cproper\u201d travel accommodation, dismissing the possibility that the benefactor sought to purchase the Justice\u2019s influence. This tendency parallels the example of the football fans tasked with evaluating their team\u2019s rule violations; even if the fans pledge to do so impartially, their subconscious preference for their team will tend to skew their evaluation towards the outcome that promotes their team\u2019s victory.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-66\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-66\">[66]</a></sup> If we accept the research indicating the vulnerability of legal actors to motivated cognition, we would be deluding ourselves to believe the Justices of the Supreme Court possess some exceptional resistance to it while facing no realistic threat of external enforcement. In light of this, the need for binding ethics reform on the court becomes clear.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215056233\"></a><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215124427\"></a><a id=\"post-9743-_Toc215124480\"></a>\u00a0IV. Solutions</h2>\n<p>This section will discuss potential ethics reforms in light of this need for external enforcement. Subpart A discusses impeachment and why it is inadequate as a sole means of ethics regulation. Subpart B briefly addresses the constitutional question surrounding ethics reform and why certain proposals should be pursued in spite of potential constitutional barriers. Subpart C presents a list of potential solutions that implement some form of external enforcement. Subpart D presents debiasing strategies supported by behavioral science for contexts in which direct enforcement is likely unconstitutional.</p>\n<h3>A. On Impeachment</h3>\n<p>Opponents of an external ethics enforcement mechanism might look towards the impeachment power as a sufficient solution for ethics violations.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-67\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-67\">[67]</a></sup> However, impeachment is too procedurally burdensome to be practically employed and inappropriately punitive for many lesser ethics violations. This renders impeachment functionally non-existent as an enforcement mechanism.</p>\n<p>No Supreme Court Justice has ever been impeached and removed by Congress.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-68\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-68\">[68]</a></sup> Justice Chase was impeached in 1804 on charges of partisanship, but he was acquitted by the Senate.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-69\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-69\">[69]</a></sup> The last attempted use of the impeachment power was against Justice Fortas in 1969, but impeachment proceedings did not materialize before the Justice\u2019s resignation.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-70\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-70\">[70]</a></sup> Both the initiation and conclusion of impeachment proceedings must clear a high procedural bar.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-71\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-71\">[71]</a></sup> This alone renders impeachment a less-than-ideal approach to ethics enforcement because it poses no probable or procedurally realistic threat to the Justices.</p>\n<p>Impeachment is also an excessively harsh means of enforcing many kinds of ethics rules. While it may be an appropriate tool for more egregious violations, it is difficult to justify impeachment for the more marginal violations, such as Justice Sotomayor\u2019s staff pressuring event hosts to buy her books as an implicit \u201cprice\u201d for her speaking arrangements.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-72\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-72\">[72]</a></sup> While behaviors such as Justice Sotomayor\u2019s are almost certainly unethical, punishing them with impeachment is hardly proportional to the violation at issue. The problem then is that as long as impeachment remains the sole means of ethics enforcement, lesser violations are either (a) over-punished with a burdensome procedure or (b) unpunished entirely. Both outcomes are undesirable. Therefore, a less punitive and more adaptable solution is needed.</p>\n<h3>B. On the Constitutional Question</h3>\n<p>The question of whether and how Congress can impose external ethics enforcement on the Court (and, if so, to what degree), is complex and remains largely unanswered.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-73\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-73\">[73]</a></sup> Arguably, the separation-of-powers principles implied in the Constitution prevent Congress from enacting any kind of ethics reform for the Court. On the other hand, some propose that Congress has plenty of constitutional avenues available to it in order to deter violations.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-74\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-74\">[74]</a></sup> The Court itself has taken care to avoid answering the question of its ethical regulation by Congress, as the Justices voluntarily adhere to ethics statutes like the Ethics in Government Act (\u201cEGA\u201d) and Ethics Reform Act while simultaneously implying that they are not actually required to do so.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-75\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-75\">[75]</a></sup> However, the Court\u2019s voluntary compliance arguably supports the theory that Congress can indeed police the Court\u2019s ethics.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the separation-of-powers doctrine is not necessarily implicated by all regulation of federal judges. Restrictions on extrajudicial activity (such as the receipt of large donations) arguably do not enter the territory of the Court\u2019s judicial function. Congress has successfully walked the constitutional line between the legislative and judicial powers by regulating, for example, the number of Justices on the Court,<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-76\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-76\">[76]</a></sup> constraints on the Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction,<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-77\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-77\">[77]</a></sup> and even the outcome of a pending case via last-minute legislation.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-78\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-78\">[78]</a></sup> If such legislative constraints on the Court are constitutional, then surely restrictions on extrajudicial conduct would be constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive analysis of Congress\u2019 constitutional capacity to regulate Supreme Court Justices\u2019 conduct is beyond the scope of this Note, as is any conjecture with regard to how the Court might respond to such legislation. Regardless, the answers to those inquiries have little bearing on the main point of this Note\u2014that stricter ethics enforcement must be pursued to the extent our constitutional structure allows, whatever that extent may be. In this pursuit, Congress should not be afraid to test boundaries in order to expedite the determination of these separation-of-powers questions. The sooner such questions are answered, the sooner that Congress can identify which avenues <em>are</em> available for enacting effective, constitutionally compliant reforms.</p>\n<h3>C. Solutions for Establishing an External Enforcement Mechanism</h3>\n<h4><em>1. Criminal and Civil Liability for Ethics Violations</em></h4>\n<p>Justices are almost certainly bound by the same framework of criminal laws to which the rest of the nation must adhere. If Justice Alito runs a stop sign on his way to oral arguments, he must submit to the legal consequences (in this case, pay a traffic fine) like everyone else.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-79\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-79\">[79]</a></sup> Why not extend similar liability to ethics violations? As it stands, Congress may already have the ability to do this in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>Congress has a built-in mechanism to enforce the Ethics in Government Act via both criminal and civil liability. The EGA provides in essence that judicial officers who \u201cwillfully fail to file or falsify their financial disclosure statements are subject to referral to the Attorney General and may face civil penalties.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-80\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-80\">[80]</a></sup> Upon referral, the Attorney General may bring civil action in order to assess a civil penalty (up to $50,000)<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-81\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-81\">[81]</a></sup> or even imprison a violator for up to one year.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-82\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-82\">[82]</a></sup> Provided that the Court is constitutionally within the purview of the EGA, this referral mechanism would apply to the Justices.</p>\n<p>An EGA referral is likely the best starting point for Congress to begin to exert some degree of control over the Court\u2019s ethics violations. First, the constitutionality of such a referral is plausible since a resulting action would only concern extrajudicial activity, not the Court\u2019s judicial function.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-83\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-83\">[83]</a></sup> Application of the EGA to the Court would allow Congress to meaningfully address ethics violations while avoiding the procedural burdens of alternatives like impeachment. The EGA could therefore prove to be a powerful deterrence tool, as it would arm Congress with a reliable way to review and punish extrajudicial misconduct.</p>\n<h4><em>2. Withholding Appropriations</em></h4>\n<p>Some have suggested that Congress could utilize its power of the purse to deter ethics violations by the Justices.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-84\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-84\">[84]</a></sup> Senator Chris Van Hollen, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee, proposed that the Senate could leverage its influence over the Court\u2019s budget in order to coerce the Court to adhere to desired ethics standards.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-85\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-85\">[85]</a></sup> For example, if a Justice failed to disclose a received gift in their annual reports, the Senate could sanction the Court for an amount appropriate for such a violation.</p>\n<p>While this would enable responsive punishment for ethics violations, it runs the risk of being overly punitive, similar to impeachment. An excessive withholding of appropriations would cripple the Court\u2019s ability to function, an obviously undesirable outcome. Withholding would thus have to be used sparingly to avoid such a result. In light of this, criminal and civil liability for ethics violations are likely the more adaptable, and therefore better, means of enforcement. However, the withholding of appropriations could nonetheless remain a useful enforcement tool if such alternatives are held unconstitutional.</p>\n<h3>D. Debiasing Strategies in the Face of Constitutional Barriers</h3>\n<h4><em>3. Public Recusal Decisions</em></h4>\n<p>A Justice\u2019s refusal to recuse themselves from a case creating a conflict of interest presents one of the more difficult ethical issues for an external body to regulate. While 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 already demands the Justices\u2019 recusal in certain situations, Congress almost certainly lacks the authority to directly regulate the Justices\u2019 decisions over this matter because doing so would implicate the Court\u2019s judicial function.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-86\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-86\">[86]</a></sup> Professor Louis Virelli has argued that this provides reason for Congress to set aside disqualification regulations and instead act on other areas of enforcement where constitutional authority is more apparent.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-87\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-87\">[87]</a></sup> However, Virelli\u2019s advice is perhaps unnecessary because there may be action Congress can still take regarding recusals. Congress could instead look to debiasing strategies to help fight against the effects of motivated cognition.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-88\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-88\">[88]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The proposed Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act of 2023 offered a regulatory solution requiring the Justices to author written opinions regarding their decisions not to recuse from a case.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-89\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-89\">[89]</a></sup> The regulation would operate as follows: First, a litigant could request a written explanation relating to a Justice\u2019s recusal decision.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-90\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-90\">[90]</a></sup> Then, the Judicial Conference would issue an advisory opinion addressing whether the Justice ought to be disqualified.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-91\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-91\">[91]</a></sup> If the Judicial Conference recommends disqualification, the Justice would then be required to provide a public explanation of the recusal decision.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-92\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-92\">[92]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Professor Avani Mehta Sood believes such a process can work to debias legal decision-makers. Sood postulates that \u201creining in\u201d motivated cognition among legal actors \u201cmight [require] drawing attention to inadvertently and inappropriately motivating factors.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-93\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-93\">[93]</a></sup> Professor Feldman provided a similar endorsement, hypothesizing that corporate and government decision-makers could use written declarations of conflicts to force the regulated actors to confront their conflicts.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-94\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-94\">[94]</a></sup> Here, the Judicial Conference\u2019s advisory opinion could serve this debiasing purpose. By publicly and explicitly highlighting a potential conflict of interest, the Judicial Conference puts the Justice on notice as to possibly motivating (i.e., biasing) factors influencing the Justice\u2019s decision-making. This notice, in turn, could help reduce the biasing effects of such factors by forcing the Justice to bring such previously subconscious motivations into the forefront of his or her conscious (and public) reasoning.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-95\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-95\">[95]</a></sup></p>\n<h4><em>4. Eliminating Ambiguities</em></h4>\n<p>As a general matter, Congress (and the Justices) should seek to eliminate ambiguities in judicial ethics statutes and codes as much as possible. While eliminating all instances of ambiguity is an impossible task, aspiring to this end will nevertheless minimize opportunities for biased readings or motivated violations of ethics rules.</p>\n<p>Professor Feldman highlights how ambiguity can \u201cenable[] people who view themselves as moral to convince themselves that unethical behavior is ethical.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-96\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-96\">[96]</a></sup> Feldman accordingly promotes more explicit language in ethics codes.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-97\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-97\">[97]</a></sup> Feldman presents the example of a company\u2019s ethics code using the specific term \u201cemployees\u201d instead of the more general \u201cwe\u201d; even this small change helped remind employees that they were bound by the code.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-98\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-98\">[98]</a></sup> In the realm of judicial ethics, providing more clear definitions as to what constitutes an \u201cimproper\u201d relationship or the types of gifts that must be disclosed would help eliminate areas where motivated cognition can influence a self-policing Justice. The less room a code or statute provides for textual interpretation, the less room there is for bias to inform the interpretation.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-99\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-99\">[99]</a></sup></p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>This Note provides empirical support for the contention that the Court cannot impartially police its own ethics. The scientific understanding of motivated cognition among legal decision-makers indicates that the Justices of the Supreme Court are not exempt from motivated cognition or other threats to their impartiality. Motivated cognition leads individuals, especially those with legal training, to rationalize their own biased decisions and unethical behavior. Accordingly, the Supreme Court\u2019s Code fails to meaningfully regulate the Justices\u2019 behavior because it entrusts to the Justices the power to enforce the Code against themselves and thereby invites the Justices to rationalize their behavior, all while believing such rationalizations are objective. In light of this, lawmakers should remain pessimistic about the Justices\u2019 ability to self-regulate and pursue some form of external enforcement.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it is important to note that the preceding analysis does not mean to assign moral blame to any Justice. To do so would not only be improper and unhelpful but is also beside the point of this Note. The problem does not lie with a few \u201cbad apples\u201d or instances of bad behavior but instead with the nature of an institution that asks its own members to regulate conduct that implicates their material and institutional interests.</p>\n<p>Congress should therefore continue to pursue ethics reform and protect bills such as the Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act from fading into obscurity while stuck in committee.<sup><a href=\"#post-9743-footnote-100\" id=\"post-9743-footnote-ref-100\">[100]</a></sup> What remains of the political momentum from the 2023 ethics crisis should be capitalized on before the public\u2019s attention is lost. The outcry resulting from that crisis led the Court to adopt its Code, an unprecedented step in the Court\u2019s history. Now, continued pressure is necessary to bring about <em>meaningful</em> ethics reform at the Court.</p>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"post-9743-footnote-1\">.

        "full_content": "Authored by Mihir Kshirsagar Observers invoke railroad, electricity, and telecom precedents when contextualizing the current generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) infrastructure boom\u2014usually to debate whether or when we are heading for a crash. But these discussions miss an important pattern that held across all three prior cycles: when the bubbles burst, investors lost money but society gained lasting benefits. The infrastructure enabled productivity gains that monopolistic owners could not fully capture. Investors lost, but society won. GenAI threatens to break this pattern. Whether or not the bubble bursts as many anticipate, we may not get the historical consolation prize. There are two reasons to doubt that GenAI will follow this trend: First , as I discuss in my prior post , the chips powering today\u2019s systems have short-asset lives compared to the decades-long life of infrastructure of past cycles. Companies are also actively pursuing software optimization techniques that could dramatically shrink hardware requirements. In either case, the infrastructure that is left behind after a correction is not likely to become a cheap commodity for future growth. Second , the current market is shaped by hyperscaler-led coalitions that enable surplus extraction at multiple layers. As I discuss below, the usage-based API pricing captures application value, information asymmetry enables direct competition with customers, and coalition structures subordinate model developers to infrastructure owners. If productivity gains materialize at scale, these rent extraction capabilities may enable hyperscalers to realize the revenues that justify infrastructure investment\u2014something past infrastructure owners could not do. But whether through sustained profitability or post-bust consolidation, the structural conditions that enabled broad diffusion of benefits in past cycles are absent. Now, there are some countervailing considerations. The research and development supporting open-weight models might be a source for productivity gains to be spread more broadly, and could even serve as the \u201cstranded assets\u201d that enable future innovation if the bubble bursts. But the regulatory environment needs to support such initiatives. Railroads The railroad industry consolidated dramatically after the Panic of 1873 . By the early 1900s, seven financial groups controlled two-thirds of the nation\u2019s railroad mileage. J.P. Morgan\u2019s syndicate reorganized bankrupt roads into the Southern Railway and consolidated eastern trunk lines. Edward Harriman controlled the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific systems. James J. Hill dominated northern routes through the Great Northern and Northern Pacific. This concentration raised serious antitrust concerns\u2014the Sherman Act was passed in 1890 largely in response to railroad monopoly power. But even with consolidation, railroad owners still struggled to pay their debts because the infrastructure\u2019s economic benefits were dispersed across the economy and did not flow back directly to the owners. Richard Hornbeck and Martin Rotemberg\u2019s important work shows how at the aggregate level when economies have input distortions\u2014misallocated labor, capital stuck in less productive uses, frictions in resource allocation\u2014the railroad infrastructure can generate substantial economy-wide productivity gains. These gains persisted over decades regardless of which financial group controlled the local rail lines. Farmers in Iowa shipping grain to Chicago paid freight rates, but the productivity improvements from market access\u2014crop specialization, mechanization investments justified by larger markets, fertilizer access\u2014stayed with the agricultural sector. The infrastructure that enabled these gains had useful lives measured in decades. Railroad tracks laid in the 1880s remained economically viable into the 1920s and beyond. Rolling stock, locomotives, and terminal facilities similarly had useful lives of twenty to forty years. When railroads consolidated, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling agricultural productivity gains. The consolidation was anticompetitive, but the economic benefits didn\u2019t concentrate entirely with the infrastructure owners. Three structural constraints, beginning with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but only effectively imposed nearly two decades later, limited railroad owners from capturing the economic surplus generated by their investments. First, bound by common carrier obligations, railroads charged fixed rates for shipping based on weight and distance, not a share of crop value. The railroad recovered infrastructure costs plus a margin, but could not discriminate based on agricultural productivity. Second, railroads had no visibility into which farms were most productive, or which crops were most profitable beyond what could be inferred from shipping volumes. As a result, they could not observe and selectively advantage their own agricultural ventures. Third , railroads faced substantial barriers to entering agriculture; directly operating farms required different expertise, capital, and management than operating rail networks. Now, railroads did try to move upstream, but regulatory actions prevented them from extending their dominant position. Electricity Samuel Insull built a utility empire in the 1920s that collapsed spectacularly in 1932, taking over $2 billion in investor wealth with it (nearly $50 billion today). The subsequent restructuring produced regional utility monopolies\u2014by the 1940s, electricity generation and distribution were recognized as natural monopolies requiring either public ownership or regulated private provision. This consolidation was problematic enough that Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935 to break up remaining utility combinations. Despite the market correction, the generating plants and transmission infrastructure built in the 1920s and 1930s had useful lives of forty to fifty years. Even as utility ownership consolidated into regional monopolies, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling manufacturing productivity gains that utilities sold electricity to but couldn\u2019t capture surplus from. Cheap electricity transformed American manufacturing in ways the utilities could not fully capture. Paul David\u2019s foundational work on the \u201cdynamo problem\u201d shows that electrification enabled factory reorganization\u2014moving from centralized steam power with belt drives to distributed electric motors allowed flexible factory layouts, continuous-process manufacturing, and eventually assembly-line production. Manufacturing productivity gains from electrification were substantial and persistent, but utilities sold kilowatt-hours at regulated rates. They could not price discriminate based on which manufacturers were most innovative or extract ongoing surplus from manufacturing productivity improvements. The constraints preventing electric utilities from capturing the surplus paralleled railroads in important respects, and were also eventually imposed through regulation. Utilities charged volumetric rates for electricity consumed, not a share of manufacturing output. A factory paid based on kilowatt-hours used, whether it was producing innovative products or commodity goods. Regulation eventually standardized rate structures, limiting even the ability to price discriminate across customer classes. Utilities had minimal visibility into how electricity was being used productively\u2014they knew aggregate consumption but couldn\u2019t observe which production processes were most valuable. And while some utilities did integrate forward into consumer appliances to stimulate residential demand, this was primarily about increasing electricity consumption rather than controlling downstream markets. Utilities faced prohibitive barriers to entering manufacturing directly; operating generating plants and distribution networks required different capabilities than running factories. Telecom In more recent memory, the telecom bust following the dot-com crash was severe. Several competitive local exchange carriers went bankrupt between 2000 and 2003. WorldCom filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy of its time in 2002. The resulting consolidation was substantial\u2014Level 3 Communications acquired multiple bankrupt competitors\u2019 assets, Verizon absorbed MCI/WorldCom, AT&T was reconstituted through acquisitions. By the mid-2000s, broadband infrastructure was concentrated among a handful of major carriers. But the fiber deployed in the 1990s\u2014much of it still in use today\u2014enabled the internet economy to flourish. The economic productivity gains from internet access are well-documented: e-commerce, SaaS businesses, remote work, streaming services, cloud computing, and so on. The constraints limiting telecom value capture were similar to earlier cycles. Carriers primarily sold bandwidth based on monthly subscriptions or per-gigabyte charges, not revenue shares from application success. A startup building on fiber infrastructure paid the same rates as established businesses. Carriers had limited visibility into which applications were succeeding and could not easily observe application-layer innovation. And telecom providers faced substantial technical and regulatory barriers to competing at the application layer during the critical formation period. Network operators were not positioned to compete with e-commerce sites, SaaS platforms, or streaming services in the late 1990s through early 2010s when the web economy was taking shape. There were exceptions that tested these boundaries. AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner and Verizon\u2019s forays into media ventures showed carriers trying vertical integration. And the important net neutrality debates centered on whether carriers could favor their own services or extract rents from application providers. Regardless, during the critical period when the web economy came into prominence, telecom companies were not vertically integrated and therefore their infrastructure was available on more horizontal terms. The pattern across all three historical cases is consistent. Infrastructure consolidation happened and proved sticky, raising legitimate competition concerns. But structural constraints meant even monopolistic infrastructure owners could not fully capture application-layer surplus. They charged for access to infrastructure\u2014shipping, kilowatt-hours, bandwidth\u2014but the productivity gains from using that infrastructure diffused broadly through the economy. The long useful lives of the infrastructure meant these spillovers persisted for decades, even as ownership consolidated. GenAI\u2019s Obsolescence Trap As I\u2019ve discussed here previously , the chips powering today\u2019s AI systems have useful lives of one to three years due to rapid technological obsolescence and physical wear from high-utilization AI workloads. This short useful life means that even if AI infrastructure spending produces excess capacity, that capacity will not be available for new entrants to acquire and leverage effectively. In railroads, electricity, and telecom, stranded assets with decades of remaining useful life became resources that others could access. Three-year-old GPUs do not provide a competitive foundation when incumbent coalitions are running current-generation hardware. Put differently, in a hypothetical 2027 GenAI bust, an over-leveraged data center stocked with 2-year-old H100s will be comparatively worthless. That compute cannot be bought for pennies on the dollar to fuel new competition. The only entities that can survive are those hyperscalers with the massive, continuous free cash flow to stay on the \u201cGPU treadmill\u201d\u2014namely, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. (Dramatic increases in software efficiency could break this hardware moat, but the hyperscalers control over distribution channels is difficult to overcome.) The combination is what changes the outcome: vertical integration that enables surplus extraction, information position that enables direct competition, coalition structure that subordinates model developers to infrastructure owners, and short asset life that prevents the emergence of reusable infrastructure that others can access. GenAI\u2019s Vertical Integration Overcomes Prior Constraints The GenAI infrastructure buildout is producing market concentration through coalition structures: Microsoft-OpenAI, Amazon-Anthropic, Google-DeepMind. These are not loose partnerships\u2014they are deeply integrated arrangements where the hyperscaler\u2019s infrastructure economics directly enable their coalition\u2019s competitive positioning at the application layer. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI and provides exclusive Azure infrastructure. Amazon is heavily invested in Anthropic. Google acquired DeepMind and is developing Gemini models that are integrated across Google Workspace and Cloud. This vertical integration attacks all three constraints that limited value capture in past cycles. First , usage-based GenAI pricing captures application-layer surplus through uncapped rates. Historically, railroads also charged based on usage\u2014more cargo meant higher bills\u2014but eventually regulators imposed the requirement to charge \u201creasonable and just\u201d rates. Similarly, electric utilities charge per kilowatt-hour but face state commission oversight that caps rates at cost-plus-reasonable-return. These regulatory firewalls prevented infrastructure providers with natural monopoly characteristics from extracting surplus beyond what regulators deemed justified by their costs. While GenAI providers charge uniform per-token rates, they do have common carrier obligations. Moreover, while enterprise pricing remains opaque, the structure of published rates suggests that costs scale in close proportion to usage. This pricing structure, unconstrained by rate regulation or transparent volume pricing, allows concentrated infrastructure providers to capture ongoing application-layer surplus as successful applications scale. This capability has implications beyond just who benefits. In past cycles, infrastructure owners couldn\u2019t capture application-layer surplus, which meant projected revenues never materialized and bubbles burst. If GenAI\u2019s rent extraction model works, it changes the financial calculus and hyperscalers may actually generate sufficient revenues to cover their capital expenditures. But this \u201csuccess\u201d would come at the cost of concentrating gains rather than diffusing them broadly. Second , API usage patterns reveal application-layer innovation. Railroads could not easily observe crop profitability, utilities could not see manufacturing processes, and telecom providers in the 1990s-2000s could not easily monitor which web applications were succeeding. Hyperscalers can see which applications are working through API call patterns, token usage, and query types. This information asymmetry could allow them to identify promising use cases and compete directly. For example, Microsoft can observe what enterprises build with OpenAI. Or Google can see which applications gain traction on Gemini. The infrastructure position provides comprehensive competitive intelligence about the application layer. Third , hyperscalers are positioned to compete at the application layer. Railroads did not enter farming, utilities did not run factories, and while some telecom providers in the 1990s tried to compete with web startups by using \u201cwalled gardens\u201d that strategy failed. By contrast, hyperscalers are already application-layer competitors. Microsoft competes in enterprise software. Google competes in productivity tools through Workspace. They can leverage GenAI capabilities to enhance existing products while simultaneously selling API access to would-be competitors. The integration runs both directions\u2014infrastructure enables their own applications while extracting value from others\u2019 applications. Indeed, in the software industry there is a long history of platforms cannibalizing or \u201c sherlocking \u201d the applications they enable. Moreover, this dynamic differs fundamentally from how cloud services were used in the last decade. When Netflix or Uber ran on AWS, they used the cloud as a commodity utility to host their own proprietary code and business logic. Amazon provided the servers, but it was not the \u201cbrain\u201d of the application. In the GenAI stack the application logic\u2014the reasoning, the content generation, the analysis\u2014resides within the infrastructure provider\u2019s model, not the customer\u2019s code. This shifts the relationship from hosting a business to \u201crenting cognition,\u201d allowing the infrastructure owner to capture a significantly higher share of the value creation. The coalition structure reinforces vertical control. OpenAI is the public face of AI innovation but is structurally dependent on Microsoft\u2019s infrastructure. Anthropic operates primarily on AWS and is tied to Amazon\u2019s ecosystem. Even the most prominent model developers lack true independence\u2014they\u2019re subordinate partners in coalitions where the hyperscaler captures value through multiple channels while retaining the option to marginalize or compete with the model developer if advantageous. Consolidation Without Spillovers In past infrastructure cycles, the implicit social bargain was clear: while investors lost, society gained. Railroad, electricity, and telecom markets all concentrated substantially after their corrections, but the infrastructure continued enabling broad economic gains that owners could not fully capture. GenAI breaks this pattern. Whether through sustained profitability (enabled by rent extraction) or through post-bust consolidation (without reusable stranded assets), we may not get the historical consolation prize. The primary counter-narrative rests with the open-weight ecosystem. A robust, competitive landscape of open models could directly challenge the structural constraints that enable surplus extraction. This open-model path, therefore, represents a critical mechanism for realizing the broad, decentralized \u201cspillover\u201d benefits that characterized past infrastructure cycles. Thus, supporting this ecosystem, whether through public access to compute or pro-competitive interoperability rules, should be a strategic imperative for ensuring that the productivity gains from AI diffuse broadly rather than concentrating within the hyperscaler coalitions.

Regardless, during the critical period when the web economy came into prominence, telecom companies were not vertically integrated and therefore their infrastructure was available on more horizontal terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pattern across all three historical cases is consistent. Infrastructure consolidation happened and proved sticky, raising legitimate competition concerns. But structural constraints meant even monopolistic infrastructure owners could not fully capture application-layer surplus. They charged for access to infrastructure\u2014shipping, kilowatt-hours, bandwidth\u2014but the productivity gains from using that infrastructure diffused broadly through the economy. The long useful lives of the infrastructure meant these spillovers persisted for decades, even as ownership consolidated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>GenAI\u2019s Obsolescence Trap</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I\u2019ve discussed here <a class=\"liinternal\" href=\"https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2025/10/15/lifespan-of-ai-chips-the-300-billion-question/\">previously</a>, the chips powering today\u2019s AI systems have useful lives of one to three years due to rapid technological obsolescence and physical wear from high-utilization AI workloads. This short useful life means that even if AI infrastructure spending produces excess capacity, that capacity will not be available for new entrants to acquire and leverage effectively. In railroads, electricity, and telecom, stranded assets with decades of remaining useful life became resources that others could access. Three-year-old GPUs do not provide a competitive foundation when incumbent coalitions are running current-generation hardware. Put differently, in a hypothetical 2027 GenAI bust, an over-leveraged data center stocked with 2-year-old H100s will be comparatively worthless. That compute cannot be bought for pennies on the dollar to fuel new competition. The only entities that can survive are those hyperscalers with the massive, continuous free cash flow to stay on the \u201cGPU treadmill\u201d\u2014namely, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. (Dramatic increases in software efficiency could break this hardware moat, but the hyperscalers control over distribution channels is difficult to overcome.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination is what changes the outcome: vertical integration that enables surplus extraction, information position that enables direct competition, coalition structure that subordinates model developers to infrastructure owners, and short asset life that prevents the emergence of reusable infrastructure that others can access.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>GenAI\u2019s Vertical Integration Overcomes Prior Constraints</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The GenAI infrastructure buildout is producing market concentration through coalition structures: Microsoft-OpenAI, Amazon-Anthropic, Google-DeepMind. These are not loose partnerships\u2014they are deeply integrated arrangements where the hyperscaler\u2019s infrastructure economics directly enable their coalition\u2019s competitive positioning at the application layer. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI and provides exclusive Azure infrastructure. Amazon is heavily invested in Anthropic. Google acquired DeepMind and is developing Gemini models that are integrated across Google Workspace and Cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This vertical integration attacks all three constraints that limited value capture in past cycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>First</strong></em>, usage-based GenAI pricing captures application-layer surplus through uncapped rates. Historically, railroads also charged based on usage\u2014more cargo meant higher bills\u2014but eventually regulators imposed the requirement to charge \u201creasonable and just\u201d rates. Similarly, electric utilities charge per kilowatt-hour but face state commission oversight that caps rates at cost-plus-reasonable-return. These regulatory firewalls prevented infrastructure providers with natural monopoly characteristics from extracting surplus beyond what regulators deemed justified by their costs. While GenAI providers charge uniform per-token rates, they do have common carrier obligations. Moreover, while enterprise pricing remains opaque, the structure of published rates suggests that costs scale in close proportion to usage. This pricing structure, unconstrained by rate regulation or transparent volume pricing, allows concentrated infrastructure providers to capture ongoing application-layer surplus as successful applications scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This capability has implications beyond just who benefits. In past cycles, infrastructure owners couldn\u2019t capture application-layer surplus, which meant projected revenues never materialized and bubbles burst. If GenAI\u2019s rent extraction model works, it changes the financial calculus and hyperscalers may actually generate sufficient revenues to cover their capital expenditures. But this \u201csuccess\u201d would come at the cost of concentrating gains rather than diffusing them broadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Second</strong></em>, API usage patterns reveal application-layer innovation. Railroads could not easily observe crop profitability, utilities could not see manufacturing processes, and telecom providers in the 1990s-2000s could not easily monitor which web applications were succeeding. Hyperscalers can see which applications are working through API call patterns, token usage, and query types. This information asymmetry could allow them to identify promising use cases and compete directly. For example, Microsoft can observe what enterprises build with OpenAI. Or Google can see which applications gain traction on Gemini. The infrastructure position provides comprehensive competitive intelligence about the application layer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Third</strong></em>, hyperscalers are positioned to compete at the application layer. Railroads did not enter farming, utilities did not run factories, and while some telecom providers in the 1990s tried to compete with web startups by using \u201cwalled gardens\u201d that strategy failed. By contrast, hyperscalers are already application-layer competitors. Microsoft competes in enterprise software. Google competes in productivity tools through Workspace. They can leverage GenAI capabilities to enhance existing products while simultaneously selling API access to would-be competitors. The integration runs both directions\u2014infrastructure enables their own applications while extracting value from others\u2019 applications. Indeed, in the software industry there is a long history of platforms cannibalizing or \u201c<a class=\"liinternal\" href=\"https://www.economist.com/babbage/2012/07/13/youve-been-sherlocked\">sherlocking</a>\u201d the applications they enable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, this dynamic differs fundamentally from how cloud services were used in the last decade. When Netflix or Uber ran on AWS, they used the cloud as a commodity utility to host their own proprietary code and business logic. Amazon provided the servers, but it was not the \u201cbrain\u201d of the application. In the GenAI stack the application logic\u2014the reasoning, the content generation, the analysis\u2014resides within the infrastructure provider\u2019s model, not the customer\u2019s code. This shifts the relationship from hosting a business to \u201crenting cognition,\u201d allowing the infrastructure owner to capture a significantly higher share of the value creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coalition structure reinforces vertical control. OpenAI is the public face of AI innovation but is structurally dependent on Microsoft\u2019s infrastructure. Anthropic operates primarily on AWS and is tied to Amazon\u2019s ecosystem. Even the most prominent model developers lack true independence\u2014they\u2019re subordinate partners in coalitions where the hyperscaler captures value through multiple channels while retaining the option to marginalize or compete with the model developer if advantageous.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Consolidation Without Spillovers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In past infrastructure cycles, the implicit social bargain was clear: while investors lost, society gained. Railroad, electricity, and telecom markets all concentrated substantially after their corrections, but the infrastructure continued enabling broad economic gains that owners could not fully capture. GenAI breaks this pattern. Whether through sustained profitability (enabled by rent extraction) or through post-bust consolidation (without reusable stranded assets), we may not get the historical consolation prize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary counter-narrative rests with the open-weight ecosystem. A robust, competitive landscape of open models could directly challenge the structural constraints that enable surplus extraction. This open-model path, therefore, represents a critical mechanism for realizing the broad, decentralized \u201cspillover\u201d benefits that characterized past infrastructure cycles. Thus, supporting this ecosystem, whether through public access to compute or pro-competitive interoperability rules, should be a strategic imperative for ensuring that the productivity gains from AI diffuse broadly rather than concentrating within the hyperscaler coalitions.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Author Note: Thanks to</em> <em><a class=\"liinternal\" href=\"https://plaw.law.princeton.edu/people/sander-mccomiskey-0\">Sander McComiskey</a> for his excellent research assistance and critical feedback.

        "full_content": "New development unlocked in Sussex following withdrawal by Natural England of water neutrality requirements November 2025 New development unlocked in Sussex following withdrawal by Natural England of water neutrality requirements Natural England has withdrawn its 2021 position statement in respect of water neutrality, ending a four-year restriction on new development in the Sussex North Water Resource (Supply) Zone. Development in the region should now become significantly more streamlined. Background For the last four years, development across the sub-region south of Gatwick has been largely on hold after a 2021 position statement by Natural England flagged a potential risk of water abstraction at Hardham affecting the Arun Valley SAC, SPA and Ramsar. The concern was that an increase in water demand from new development could lead to increased abstraction and in turn adversely impact the protected designation\u2019s qualifying features, including Little Whirlpool Ramshorn Snail Anisus vorticulus. To avoid the potential for harm to arise and to comply with the Habitats Regulations, all new schemes were required to demonstrate water neutrality , ensuring total water use did not increase. To enable new development, a strategic scheme has been in development by local authorities to improve the water efficiency of local housing stock, so as to provide headroom for new development. This has meant all development in the sub-region effectively remained on hold pending this scheme, delaying local plans and construction of thousands of new homes. Change of Natural England\u2019s position To investigate whether the potential concern raised by Natural England in 2021 was justified, a Hardham Basin Environmental Study has been conducted by Southern Water to determine if the aquifer at Hardham, from which abstraction occurs, is linked to Arun Valley SAC. This study has now reported and has enabled Natural England to withdraw its position statement, subject to the following measures in the form of a reduced abstraction licence cap and a separate package of habitat recovery measures to support Pulborough Brooks SSSI (part of the SAC). Natural England highlight that the modification of the Hardham Groundwater abstraction licence is the primary element of interest to local authorities in making decisions as it \u2018decouples the abstraction from new development\u2019 and removes any connection between abstraction and growth. Aspect Ecology\u2019s evidence at public inquiry in 2024 The above solution largely mirrors evidence presented by Aspect Ecology at public inquiry on this matter in 2024, as previously reported in our news article . Aspect Ecology\u2019s Senior Director Alistair Baxter set out that, in this case, the relevant regulator with responsibility for Habitat Regulations matters was in fact the Environment Agency (rather than Natural England). In this regard Alistair highlighted that the Environment Agency had already acted in 2021 to obtain an undertaking from Southern Water to minimise abstraction at Hardham (and water abstraction had been significantly reduced to a level well below the now amended licence level). Therefore, the link between abstraction and growth had already been \u2018decoupled\u2019 in 2021. It appears that in 2025 Natural England now concurs with Alistair\u2019s evidence as to the effectiveness of the Environment Agency\u2019s actions (now further secured by a licence amendment) and hence have modified their position statement. The abstraction licence revision will be issued in 2026. In the meantime, Natural England and Horsham District Council further agree with Alistair\u2019s evidence that Southern Water\u2019s 2024/25 water efficiency savings provide sufficient headroom to allow new development to move forward as water neutral from 1 November 2025 without the need for water neutrality offsetting or associated Section 106 obligations. Furthermore, the previously scheduled Sussex North Water Certification Scheme (SNWCS), developed at a cost of least \u00a3250,000 of public funds, will no longer be launched as this is not required. Local authorities will continue to undertake Appropriate Assessments to ensure compliance with the Habitats Regulations until the new licence takes effect. Due to general water stress in the area, local authorities will also likely require new dwellings to comply with Building Regulations Part G Optional Technical Standard (currently 110 l/p/d). Conclusion These changes are anticipated to unlock around 4,000 stalled homes and 17,000 additional homes across the region. Planning authorities will now begin issuing decisions on delayed applications and processing updates to existing consents. While water stress remains a challenge, this marks a major step forward in Sussex with strategic, sustainable water management, supporting both housing delivery and environmental protection.

        "full_content": "Article Summary \u2022 Experts say the shutdown provided new insights into the Trump administration\u2019s priorities on food and agriculture and resulted in changes that will likely have long-lasting consequences. \u2022 The shutdown added to uncertainty for Americans who rely on SNAP benefits, as the pause in benefits came on top of ongoing changes to the program. \u2022 The USDA reopened offices that make commodity payments to farmers, but conservation payments were paused, and those programs now face backlogs. \u2022 At the EPA, the Trump administration kept deregulatory actions and pesticide approvals moving despite the shutdown. At a Capitol Hill press conference on Nov. 20, a group of Senate and House Democrats announced they were introducing a bill to roll back cuts to the country\u2019s biggest hunger program. Republicans had made those cuts\u2014 predicted to result in 2.7 million people losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits\u2014in their One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) just a few months before. But the national conversation around SNAP has since changed, and for one big, ugly reason: the longest government shutdown in history. At the press conference, Senator Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-New Mexico), who led the group, started his remarks with the shutdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) then mentioned it several times. \u201cDuring the shutdown, the Trump administration did something no administration in modern history has ever done,\u201d Schumer said, referring to the decision not to use emergency funds to continue paying families. \u201cDuring the shutdown, they marched into court twice to block families from receiving SNAP benefits.\u201d The shutdown, the lawmakers made clear, is likely to loom large in Washington, D.C., for some time. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) speaks to reporters during a news conference on Nov. 5, underscoring the shutdown\u2019s political implications. (Photo credit: Tom Brenner/Getty Images) Because federal agencies were forced to make choices about which food and agriculture programs to keep running and which to pause, the shutdown provided new insights into the Trump administration\u2019s priorities, experts say. It also likely resulted in changes within agencies that will have long-lasting consequences, not only for farmers but for all Americans. Civil Eats talked to top policy experts for their take on what the shutdown revealed about the current state of food and agriculture policy, and how the future of the country\u2019s food system might look a little different as a result. Changes to SNAP Rules Compounded the Shutdown\u2019s Impact Now that the shutdown is over, SNAP is returning to its typical operations , said Katie Bergh, senior food assistance policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Most households have received their full November benefits, following delays from the Trump administration during the shutdown. But for many households, getting full benefits will not erase the impact of the shutdown. Without assistance, SNAP recipients may have opted to buy groceries in lieu of paying an electric bill or car payment, for example, and are now potentially falling behind in their bills. \u201cAll of that chaos and disruption is going to have long-term impacts for the households that were struggling to follow what was happening and waiting on their benefits in the interim,\u201d Bergh said. The funding package passed by Congress to end the shutdown did fully fund SNAP through the rest of the federal fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, 2026. This prevents a disruption in SNAP benefits in the case of another potential shutdown fight in January. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about very major, sweeping program changes that impact millions of people.\u201d But as states were dealing with uncertainty due to the shutdown, they were also implementing OBBB policy changes that could permanently kick individuals off the program. Some OBBB policies went into effect right after the law was signed in July, but SNAP administrators were given a 120-day grace period to implement new policies without being penalized for administrative mistakes. That period ended Nov. 1, but for many states that was not enough time, said Bergh. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about very major, sweeping program changes that impact millions of people,\u201d Bergh said. Many states were also waiting on guidance from the USDA on how to implement new policies. But that guidance came far too late in some cases , Bergh said. As a result of the confusion from the policy implementation, people could lose SNAP \u201cunnecessarily,\u201d Bergh said. States could also see a spike in error rates\u2014or the amount of over- and underpayments made to SNAP recipients\u2014which is troubling, given these rates will eventually determine the level of federal support they receive for SNAP benefits. Toward the end of the shutdown, the administration made it clear it would not tap into other resources to support November benefits, and it fought off legal attempts that would have forced it to do so. Now that the government has reopened, many of those suits are void. Some aspects of the SNAP litigation may continue, however. A case filed by a coalition of nonprofits has also challenged the administration\u2019s early termination of certain work-requirement waivers in several states. People in need line up to receive free food during a Thanksgiving food giveaway in Oakland, California, on Nov. 24. Tens of thousands of Bay Area households are turning to emergency groceries after the temporary halt in SNAP benefits worsened already high levels of food insecurity. (Photo credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) One of the biggest OBBB policy changes, one that is expected to remove 2.7 million people from SNAP, involves work requirements for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD). On top of increasing the age range for these recipients from 54 to 64, the bill makes it more difficult for states to exempt residents through waivers. The groups want to stop USDA from ending these waivers before the pre-OBBB expiration dates, which range from March to October 2026. And although a Rhode Island federal judge has enjoined USDA from terminating the waivers, the Trump administration could appeal that decision. Other groups have challenged USDA guidance that states must return full SNAP benefits issued during the shutdown as a result of a lower court\u2019s order.\u00a0While it\u2019s unclear whether that legal challenge will continue, the USDA did put out updated guidance indicating that states would not be held accountable for any delays or issues throughout the shutdown. This means any payment errors are unlikely to show up in a state\u2019s error rate for the year. Even after the shutdown, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has discussed requiring SNAP recipients to reapply for benefits. While the government was shut down, the USDA also sent a proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget that could remove additional swaths of people from SNAP, Bergh warned. All this adds to the uncertainty over the program for the roughly 42 million people that rely on it. \u201cThis shutdown really highlighted the vulnerability of WIC and demonstrated how any lapse in funding can create real instability.\u201d Overall, Bergh said the shutdown illustrated how essential SNAP is. During the gap in benefits, she said the charitable food sector was unable to completely meet people\u2019s needs. The shutdown also had an indirect impact on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). At the onset of the shutdown, a contingency fund available for WIC was set to run out. The administration did support WIC benefits throughout the shutdown, but not before it created uncertainty around those and other payments. That left anti-hunger groups to combat a lot of misinformation about the program\u2019s operations. \u201cThis shutdown really highlighted the vulnerability of WIC and demonstrated how any lapse in funding can create real instability,\u201d said Kate Scully, deputy director of WIC at the Food Research and Action Center. Conservation Programs Now Face a Backlog During the shutdown, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) continued some operations funded through mandatory farm bill dollars. But farmer-facing operations, like the processing of contracts, ceased. Since nearly all NRCS staff were furloughed during this period, no one was available to visit farms to confirm that farmers were fulfilling their federal conservation contracts. That meant that farmers then didn\u2019t receive the federal dollars owed through those contracts. \u201cYou\u2019re hitting the pause button on conservation during the shutdown,\u201d Mike Lavender, director of policy at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, told Civil Eats. NRCS is funded through a mix of mandatory and discretionary spending, which makes it challenging during a shutdown to parse out which operations can continue, said Robert Bonnie, a former Agriculture undersecretary for conservation under the Biden administration. Even the staff for NRCS programs are supported by a mix of funds. During the 2013 shutdown, when Bonnie was working at the agency, he said NRCS and other farm programs closed. But over time, they were able to adapt the shutdown plan and reopen certain essential programs when possible. That\u2019s all a challenging process, however, and requires legal scrutiny to ensure the government doesn\u2019t break the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits agencies from spending money without appropriations. \u201cPeople tend to be fairly conservative about it,\u201d Bonnie said. When farmers experienced these delays in conservation funding, they were left to front the federal portion themselves or find alternative ways to pay for expenses.\u00a0Like taking on other loans or putting the costs on their credit card. Now that the shutdown is over, federal workers will have to tackle a backlog of contracts to be verified and processed. But the NRCS has lost at least 2,400 employees under the Trump administration, which could make it challenging to catch up, Lavender said. When farmers experienced these delays in conservation funding, they were left to front the federal portion themselves or find alternative ways to pay for expenses. The October shutdown came at an inopportune time, because that month is when the NRCS starts determining how to deploy farm-bill resources, Bonnie said. October is also when many farmers are out of the fields and interact with NRCS staff to plan their next year.\u00a0These processes lost a precious 43 days under the shutdown, which will create \u201cenormous challenges\u201d in the creation of agreements and the processing of payments, Bonnie said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about sustainability, it\u2019s also about markets and farmers being asked by their customers to produce commodities in a certain way with less environmental footprint,\u201d Bonnie said. \u201cNRCS provides resources that de-risks that for farmers so they can make a transition.\u201d Cuts to NRCS staffing , particularly technical assistance, had already undermined this effort, he said.\u00a0And the USDA had already paused or terminated conservation contracts earlier in the year. Under the deal to end the shutdown, meanwhile, Congress passed annual appropriations for the USDA and a farm bill extension. But these both include cuts to conservation, including a $75-million reduction to NRCS technical assistance. \u201cI think there\u2019s all of those things that are setbacks to conservation,\u201d Lavender said. Commodity Payments Overshadowed Other Farmer Priorities While NRCS offices remained closed during the shutdown, the USDA reopened Farm Service Agency (FSA) offices to distribute payments to commodity and dairy farmers and process some farm loans. That was an important decision, said Mike Stranz, the vice president of advocacy at the National Farmers Union (NFU), especially because the shutdown happened right when most commodity subsidies are distributed. \u201cWe would have preferred not to have had a government shutdown and a three-week delay in a lot of those programs, but that was the reality of the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cUSDA did take some steps to help out farmers, given the circumstances we\u2019re in.\u201d Educator Shane New (right) displays healthy soil at CS Ranch during the Soil Health Academy, which teaches regenerative agriculture techniques. The shutdown meant few federal resources went toward agricultural research and conservation. (Photo credit: Mario Tama/Getty Images) In terms of long-term impacts, Stranz said he\u2019s most worried about the time lost on important agricultural research projects. According to a recent analysis from the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (NSAC), the USDA\u2019s four primary research agencies have lost nearly a quarter of their staff since January. As far as the bill that ended the shutdown, Stranz said the union was relieved to see that agriculture funding passed without a rider , proposed earlier, that would have gutted the USDA\u2019s ability to protect farmers from meatpacker abuses. The farm bill extension was necessary too, he said, to ensure farm programs keep running. However, the NFU is still pushing for a full farm bill as soon as possible, and he worried that the extension could take some political pressure off lawmakers. \u201cHopefully it sets the stage for the early 2026 Farm Bill 2.0 process that has been hinted at by leaders of the ag committees,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was painful was the politicization [of healthcare access] and the disregard for a lot of things that farmers care about as part of the negotiations.\u201d At the National Young Farmers Coalition, Director of Government Relations Vanessa Garcia Polanco and Co-Executive Director Michelle Hughes said that the battle over the Affordable Care Act (ACA) credits that led to the shutdown was more revealing than how the USDA handled the pause. \u201cWhat was painful was the politicization [of healthcare access] and the disregard for a lot of things that farmers care about as part of the negotiations,\u201d Polanco said. \u201cMembers on the Hill were saying that the ACA tax credits were not that important, that we were exaggerating. What we know to be true is that this is a program farmers really care about .\u201d In national surveys that the organization conducts every five years, young farmers have consistently cited the affordability of healthcare as a top concern. Hughes and Polanco were also disheartened by the fact that the farm bill and agriculture appropriations sections attached to the bill ending the shutdown included less funding for conservation efforts. They also noted that those sections reduced funding for popular programs that support local food systems, like Value-Added Producer Grants, which help farmers turn their crops into higher-priced products such as kraut from cabbage or cheese from milk. \u201cMost young farmers are interested in local, regional food systems,\u201d Polanco said. \u201cDisinvestment in local food systems is disinvestment in farmers.\u201d Pesticide Approvals and Deregulation Ramped Up At the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the shutdown brought the agency\u2019s priorities into sharp focus, said Betsy Southerland, a former EPA official who now works with the Environmental Protection Network, a watchdog group. As soon as Lee Zeldin was confirmed as EPA administrator, he launched a sweeping deregulatory agenda. Those efforts continued during the shutdown, Southerland said. For example, the agency proposed exempting some manufacturers from having to report the presence of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), commonly called \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d in their products. \u201cThat\u2019s been their big focus,\u201d Southerland said. \u201cNothing\u2019s been done on regulations that would actually improve public health or the environment, because those people were all furloughed.\u201d EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin speaks as President Donald Trump holds a cabinet meeting in August. (Photo credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Zeldin had previously committed to speeding up approvals of new pesticides to address a backlog of chemical applications, and that work continued as well. During the shutdown, EPA officials completed the registration of one pesticide that had been proposed for approval in April and proposed the approval of another. Another approval was completed a week after the shutdown ended, demonstrating that work on the application had continued. All three qualify as forever chemicals based on a commonly used definition. Southerland said the speed of approvals has been unprecedented, and she worries that critical steps are being skipped. For example, she said, applications submitted by chemical companies are often missing information related to their health or environmental impacts, and reviewers typically go back to the companies to request additional information. That process takes time. \u201cI\u2019m certain that is not happening now, because you can\u2019t get those enormous turnaround times unless you just basically accept what\u2019s in the current application and don\u2019t ask for any additional information,\u201d she said. Southerland is particularly concerned about how the shutdown might have further slowed research into the toxicity of chemicals that have the potential to contaminate food and water. In July, the EPA eliminated the Office of Research and Development, its main department for scientific research. The agency said it was creating a new office that would \u201cprioritize research and science more than ever before,\u201d but it\u2019s unclear whether work on the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), which the Office of Research and Development used to produce important hazard assessments of substances like forever chemicals, has continued. \u201cIf the IRIS program had been a priority, they would have been looking at the PFAS that are clearly in our drinking water and in our fish and would have been telling us how toxic they are, but [the employees] are all gone,\u201d Southerland said. During the shutdown, all research ground to a halt, so any projects that were still ongoing will likely be delayed. It\u2019s a good example of a point experts at the Environmental Protection Network have made repeatedly over the last few months: that impacts of the actual shutdown are intertwined with what they call an \u201cinternal shutdown\u201d happening at the EPA, caused by about 4,000 fewer employees and a priority shift from regulation to deregulation. What Comes Next Heading into 2026, Democrats allied with hunger advocacy groups are hoping that the shutdown and the spotlight it placed on SNAP will provide momentum to roll back some of the cuts made in the OBBB. While that\u2019s a long shot, the party is likely to make access to SNAP benefits a key issue during the midterm elections. Meanwhile, farm groups and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will be looking toward a farm bill. Given the extension attached to the continuing resolution ending the shutdown, and the farm programs included in the OBBB, any farm bill that does emerge is likely to look very different from those that came before. The \u201cbig ticket\u201d items, like commodity subsidies and SNAP changes, were inserted into the OBBB or funded in the appropriations bill, so attention will likely be on pieces of the farm bill that generally get less attention, like conservation changes, local food and organic programs, rural development programs, and agricultural research. It is unclear when a more comprehensive farm bill might be passed again. In the immediate future, another deadline looms. If Congress fails to pass full-year funding bills by Jan. 30, the government will shut down all over again. This time around, since full-year appropriations were passed for the USDA and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), those agencies won\u2019t be affected. SNAP and WIC funding won\u2019t be interrupted. Still, farmers and the food system will certainly feel the ripple effects. \u201cI hope we can learn something from this,\u201d said Stranz at the National Farmers Union, \u201cbecause we didn\u2019t gain much at all.\u201d The post What the Shutdown Revealed About Food and Agriculture\u00a0Policy appeared first on Civil Eats .",

Most households have received their full November benefits, <a href=\"https://civileats.com/newsletter/archive/the-latest-from-the-food-policy-tracker-trump-administration-moves-to-block-court-order-to-release-snap-funds/\">following delays</a> from the Trump administration during the shutdown.</p></div><div class=\"post-simple\">\n<p>But for many households, getting full benefits will not erase the impact of the shutdown. Without assistance, SNAP recipients may have opted to buy groceries in lieu of paying an electric bill or car payment, for example, and are now potentially falling behind in their bills.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of that chaos and disruption is going to have long-term impacts for the households that were struggling to follow what was happening and waiting on their benefits in the interim,\u201d Bergh said.</p>\n<p>The funding package passed by Congress to end the shutdown did fully fund SNAP through the rest of the federal fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, 2026. This prevents a disruption in SNAP benefits in the case of another potential shutdown fight in January.</p>\n<div class=\"post-quote\"><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about very major, sweeping program changes that impact millions of people.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<p>But as states were dealing with uncertainty due to the shutdown, they were also implementing <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/11/03/food-insecurity-predicted-to-rise-as-new-snap-work-requirements-take-effect/\">OBBB policy changes </a>that could permanently kick individuals off the program.</p>\n<p>Some OBBB policies went into effect right after the law was signed in July, but SNAP administrators were given a 120-day grace period to implement new policies without being penalized for administrative mistakes.

Many states were also waiting on guidance from the USDA on how to implement new policies. But that <a href=\"https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/OBBB-Implementation-Memo-Alien-SNAP-Eligibility-Oct31.pdf\">guidance came far too late in some cases</a>, Bergh said.</p>\n<p>As a result of the confusion from the policy implementation, people could lose SNAP \u201cunnecessarily,\u201d Bergh said. States could also see a spike in error rates\u2014or the amount of over- and underpayments made to SNAP recipients\u2014which is troubling, given these rates will eventually determine the level of federal support they receive for SNAP benefits.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the shutdown, the administration made it clear it would not tap into other resources to support November benefits, and it fought off <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/11/10/food-assistance-remains-in-limbo-after-weekend-of-legal-back-and-forth/\">legal attempts</a> that would have forced it to do so.</p>\n<p>Now that the government has reopened, many of those suits are void.

According to a recent <a href=\"https://sustainableagriculture.net/blog/usda-staffing-crisis-research-agencies-face-steep-losses-as-reorganization-advances/\">analysis</a> from the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (NSAC), the USDA\u2019s four primary research agencies have lost nearly a quarter of their staff since January.</p>\n<p>As far as the bill that ended the shutdown, Stranz said the union was relieved to see that agriculture funding passed without a <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/06/09/agriculture-appropriations-bill-could-gut-landmark-farmer-protections/\">rider</a>, proposed earlier, that would have gutted the USDA\u2019s ability to protect farmers from meatpacker abuses.</p>\n<p>The farm bill extension was necessary too, he said, to ensure farm programs keep running. However, the NFU is still pushing for a full farm bill as soon as possible, and he worried that the extension could take some political pressure off lawmakers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully it sets the stage for the early 2026 Farm Bill 2.0 process that has been hinted at by leaders of the ag committees,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div class=\"post-quote\"><p>\u201cWhat was painful was the politicization [of healthcare access] and the disregard for a lot of things that farmers care about as part of the negotiations.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<p>At the National Young Farmers Coalition, Director of Government Relations Vanessa Garcia Polanco and Co-Executive Director Michelle Hughes said that the battle over <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/11/19/farmers-face-prospect-of-skyrocketing-healthcare-premiums/\">the Affordable Care Act (ACA) credits</a> that led to the shutdown was more revealing than how the USDA handled the pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was painful was the politicization [of healthcare access] and the disregard for a lot of things that farmers care about as part of the negotiations,\u201d Polanco said. \u201cMembers on the Hill were saying that the ACA tax credits were not that important, that we were exaggerating. What we know to be true is that <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/11/19/farmers-face-prospect-of-skyrocketing-healthcare-premiums/\">this is a program farmers really care about</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>In national surveys that the organization conducts every five years, young farmers have consistently cited the affordability of healthcare as a top concern.</p>\n<p>Hughes and Polanco were also disheartened by the fact that the farm bill and agriculture appropriations sections attached to the bill ending the shutdown included less funding for conservation efforts. They also noted that those sections reduced funding for popular programs that support local food systems, like <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2019/10/23/making-cheese-or-jam-a-usda-program-to-pay-farmers-more-for-their-crops-faces-cuts-again/\">Value-Added Producer Grants,</a> which help farmers turn their crops into higher-priced products such as kraut from cabbage or cheese from milk.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost young farmers are interested in local, regional food systems,\u201d Polanco said. \u201cDisinvestment in local food systems is disinvestment in farmers.\u201d</p>\n<h4>Pesticide Approvals and Deregulation Ramped Up</h4>\n</div><div class=\"post-simple post-capital-letter\"><p>At the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the shutdown brought the agency\u2019s priorities into sharp focus, said Betsy Southerland, a former EPA official who now works with the Environmental Protection Network, a watchdog group.</p></div><div class=\"post-simple\">\n<p>As soon as Lee Zeldin was confirmed as EPA administrator, he<a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/03/13/deregulatory-blitz-at-epa-includes-climate-and-water-rules-that-impact-agriculture/\"> launched</a> a sweeping deregulatory agenda. Those efforts continued during the shutdown, Southerland said. For example, the agency <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-proposes-changes-make-pfas-reporting-requirements-more-practical-and-0\">proposed </a>exempting some manufacturers from having to report the presence of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), commonly called \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d in their products.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s been their big focus,\u201d Southerland said. \u201cNothing\u2019s been done on regulations that would actually improve public health or the environment, because those people were all furloughed.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"post-image-caption align-right\"><a href=\"https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/what-the-shutdown-revealed-about-food-and-agriculture-policy-6.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 26: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin speaks as President Donald Trump holds a cabinet meeting with members of his administration in the Cabinet Room of the White House on August 26, 2025 in Washington, DC. This is the seventh cabinet meeting of Trump's second term.

(Photo credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>Zeldin had previously committed to speeding up approvals of new pesticides to address a backlog of chemical applications, and that work continued as well. During the shutdown, EPA officials <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/11/05/epa-proposes-approving-fifth-forever-chemical-pesticide/\">completed the registration</a> of one pesticide that had been proposed for approval in April and proposed the approval of another. Another approval <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2021-0641-0309\">was completed</a> a week after the shutdown ended, demonstrating that work on the application had continued. All three <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/09/08/epa-approves-four-new-pesticides-that-qualify-as-pfas/\">qualify as forever chemicals</a> based on a commonly used definition.</p>\n<p>Southerland said the speed of approvals has been unprecedented, and she worries that critical steps are being skipped. For example, she said, applications submitted by chemical companies are often missing information related to their health or environmental impacts, and reviewers typically go back to the companies to request additional information. That process takes time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m certain that is not happening now, because you can&#8217;t get those enormous turnaround times unless you just basically accept what&#8217;s in the current application and don&#8217;t ask for any additional information,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Southerland is particularly concerned about how the shutdown might have further slowed research into the toxicity of chemicals that have the potential to contaminate food and water.</p>\n<p>In July, the EPA <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/epa-eliminates-research-and-development-office-as-it-begins-thousands-of-layoffs\">eliminated</a> the Office of Research and Development, its main department for scientific research. The agency said it was creating a new office that would \u201cprioritize research and science more than ever before,\u201d but it\u2019s unclear whether work on the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), which the Office of Research and Development used to produce important hazard assessments of substances like forever chemicals, has continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the IRIS program had been a priority, they would have been looking at the PFAS that are clearly in our drinking water and in our fish and would have been telling us how toxic they are, but [the employees] are all gone,\u201d Southerland said.</p>\n<p>During the shutdown, all research ground to a halt, so any projects that were still ongoing will likely be delayed. It\u2019s a good example of a point experts at the Environmental Protection Network have made repeatedly over the last few months: that impacts of the actual shutdown are intertwined with what they call an \u201cinternal shutdown\u201d happening at the EPA, caused by about 4,000 fewer employees and a priority shift from regulation to deregulation.</p>\n<h4>What Comes Next</h4>\n</div><div class=\"post-simple post-capital-letter\"><p>Heading into 2026, Democrats allied with hunger advocacy groups are hoping that the shutdown and the spotlight it placed on SNAP will provide momentum to roll back some of the cuts made in the OBBB. While that\u2019s a long shot, the party is likely to make access to SNAP benefits a key issue during the midterm elections.</p></div><div class=\"post-simple\">\n<p>Meanwhile, farm groups and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will be looking toward a farm bill. Given the extension attached to the continuing resolution ending the shutdown, and the farm programs included in the OBBB, any farm bill that does emerge is likely to look very different from those that came before.</p>\n<p>The \u201cbig ticket\u201d items, like commodity subsidies and SNAP changes, were inserted into the OBBB or funded in the appropriations bill, so attention will likely be on pieces of the farm bill that generally get less attention, like conservation changes, local food and organic programs, rural development programs, and agricultural research. It is unclear when a more comprehensive farm bill might be passed again.</p>\n<p>In the immediate future, another deadline looms. If Congress fails to pass full-year funding bills by Jan. 30, the government will shut down all over again.</p>\n<p>This time around, since full-year appropriations were passed for the USDA and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), those agencies won\u2019t be affected. SNAP and WIC funding won\u2019t be interrupted. Still, farmers and the food system will certainly feel the ripple effects.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope we can learn something from this,\u201d said Stranz at the National Farmers Union, \u201cbecause we didn\u2019t gain much at all.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"ctx-module-container ctx_default_placement ctx-clearfix\"></div><span class=\"ctx-article-root\"><!-- --></span><p>The post <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/12/01/what-the-shutdown-revealed-about-food-and-agriculture-policy/\">What the Shutdown Revealed About Food and Agriculture&nbsp;Policy</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://civileats.com\">Civil Eats</a>.</p>"

This covered the early history of the late Eugene Garfield\u2019s work as well as current developments and future trends. The historical sessions were fascinating, describing the remarkable innovations that Garfield made in his quest to understand the body of scientific information as a network. He realised that similarities between articles could be identified by shared citations, and, in the 1950s he devised systems for capturing this information using punched cards.  I am old enough to remember going to the library in the 1970s to consult Science Citation Index, which could not only point me to important articles in my field, but often led me in strange directions as I stumbled upon other fascinating topics. Garfield is known as the father of the Journal Impact Factor, which is regarded by many as an abomination that distorts publishing behaviour because of its connotations of prestige. It was, however, originally conceived as an index\u00a0that would help librarians decide which journals to purchase, and only later repurposed into a metric that people used as a proxy for the status of the researchers publishing in those journals. I enjoyed hearing about Garfield, who sounds like a delightful and humane polymath, who recognised the value of the information in indexes and found ingenious ways to synthesise it. I can recommend an archive of his work maintained by the University of Pennsylvania. The later speakers in the webinar focused on novel developments in the use of scientometrics to evaluate research quality. Giovanni Abramo noted how Italian science had been affected by favouritism, because of an exclusive reliance on subjective peer review to evaluate researchers and their institutions. His view is that use of metrics improves research evaluation by making it fairer and more objective. He noted that while metrics may not be an option in some areas of arts and humanities, for disciplines where outputs generally appear in indexed journals, bibliometrics were invaluable, concluding that \u201cbibliometrics are to research assessment what diagnostic imaging is to medicine\u201d- i.e. a key source of objective information. Funnily enough, I would have agreed with him 12 years ago, when I suggested a simple bibliometric index (departmental H-index ) could achieve very similar results to the complex and time-consuming peer review process adopted in the British Research Excellence Framework.  At the time I was writing, I thought that Goodhart\u2019s Law (\"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\") wouldn\u2019t apply to a citation-based metric, because citations were not controlled by authors, so it would be difficult to game. It turns out I was na\u00efve. The crudest method of gaming is excessive self-citation, but there are also citation rings (you cite my paper and I\u2019ll cite yours).  This year Maria \u00c1ngeles Oviedo-Garc\u00eda, Ren\u00e9 Aquarius and I described a more sophisticated version, a \u201creview mill\u201d , where a group of Italian medics used positions as peer reviewers to coerce citations to work of the group.  We suggested that the change in Italian research evaluation, which had been implemented with the best of intentions, had led to cynical gaming of peer review.  One might respond by saying that this activity, though disturbing, affects only a tiny proportion of articles and so would not have a detectable effect.  Again, I would have agreed a decade ago.  But now, with an explosion in publications that seems driven by publishers who are more focused on income than quality (see Hanson et al, 2024 ), and extraordinarily lax editorial standards, \u00a0that may no longer be true. The key point about review mills is that we saw evidence of their activity because they used generic templates for peer reviews, but these can be detected only for journals that publish open peer review \u2013 a tiny minority.  The most prolific member of the review mill was a journal editor who had nearly 3000 verified peer reviews listed on Web of Science, only a handful of which we could access. So I fear that bibliometrics is more like a diagnostic image that has blurred together data from several patients - there is some valid information in there, but it's distorted by error. The final presentation by Valentin Bogorov described the future of Scientometrics, where AI would be harnessed to give much more fine-grained and nuanced information about societal impacts of research.  But I felt he was ignoring the elephant of fraud that had lumbered into the bibliometric databases.  Review mills are one issue for the validity of citation data, but paper mills are a much bigger problem. Whereas review mills rely on the self-organisation of dubious research groups to burnish their reputations, many paper mills are run by outside organisations whose sole motivation is financial profit ( Parker et al ., 2024).\u00a0They sell authorships and citations for a price that depends on the Impact Factor of the journal - Eugene Garfield would be turning in his grave.  They were first detected about 12 years ago but have multiplied like a virus and are seriously infecting whole bodies of research.  Sometimes they are first recognised when a researcher with subject-domain expertise finds anomalous or fraudulent articles when trying to review the field (see, e.g., Aquarius et al, 2025 ). Paper mills thrive in a warm, soggy environment, where corrupt or incompetent editors will wave through articles that contain clear breaches of scientific method, or even are evidently patched together from various plagiarised articles. The hope of publishers is that AI will provide ways to detect fraudulent papers and remove them before they enter the literature, but paper millers have proved skilled at mutating to evade detection. Unfortunately, the very areas where AI and big data seem to hold most promise, such as databases linking genes, proteins, molecules and biomarkers, already are contaminated. \u00a0The fear is that the papermillers will themselves increasingly use AI to create ever more plausible articles. I am not opposed to bibliometrics or AI in principle, but I find the optimism about its application to research evaluation concerning, especially since no mention was made of the problems that will emerge if the database interrogated by AI is polluted. Any method of evaluation will have costs, benefits and unforeseen consequences. My concern is that if we focus only on the benefits, we could end up with a system that encourages fraudsters and rewards those who are most skilled at gaming the system rather than the best scientists.",

Since November 2024, court records show 1,155 citations were issued, and judges ordered 303 license suspensions.\u00a0 This investigation prompted city officials to pause the ticket-writing practice while they evaluate the program.</p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\">Legal Aid is currently reviewing the situation and working to provide accurate information and tools to assist.

Because I wanted to give you a love letter. And it seemed like the most appropriate love letter to give you would be an extremely indirect one that screams, \"DO NOT FEEL SCARED\u2014I AM JUST INTERACTING WITH YOU!!\") --------------------------------- For the first few years of my life, the only people I knew how to find lived in my house. We had a neighbor, Richard. But Richard was quiet and rarely outside for long, so I didn't know about him. One afternoon, though, Richard went outside. That's how I found out about him. I did not interact with Richard. I just saw him. He probably didn't even know. He stood in his driveway for a minute or two and then went back into his house. But I saw him. I think that was the main thing. It was very exciting. A person lives next to us! A person! He lives right there! And I SAW him!\u00a0 When will he go outside again?\u00a0 What else does he do?\u00a0 Does he know about dad? Who is his friend?\u00a0 Does he like whales?\u00a0 Is his house the same as ours?\u00a0 Which room does his grandma live in? Desperate to catch another glimpse of him, I'd lurk near the windows all day just staring at his house. I think I expected it go somewhere. You can't find out there's a person living right next to you and then never get any answers. Maybe if you're 100 and you know everybody, but not if you're 3. Not when it's the first stranger you know how to find. I just wanted to know more. Anything. And this is as far as it would have been able to go if it wasn't for the dog door. My grandma usually supervised me while my parents were at work. She'd drink screwdrivers and do the crossword, I'd run around the house and do whatever. If she hadn't seen me in a while, she'd check to make sure I still had all my fingers, but escaping wasn't a big concern. The doors were locked. Just in case, there were jingle bells on the handles. The dog door was the single weak point in the fortress. The revolutionary impact the dog door had on my ability to observe Richard was second only to the discovery of Richard himself. I was cautious at first. I just wanted to get a little closer. Just a little. I'd sneak out through the dog door and go stare at his house from the edge of our driveway, hoping this would summon him. When it didn't, I'd sneak a little closer. Maybe it'll work if I stand in Richard's driveway\u2026. or, actually, maybe I'll just go over to this little window here and see what I can see\u2026 I started sneaking out more frequently. I started sneaking out at night. And the fact that I was sneaking seems to suggest I might've been at least partially aware that this type of behavior should be a secret, but I don't think I'd reached that crucial developmental turning point where you're capable of recognizing how creepy you're being. However, on the night I found the cat door in Richard's garage, even my undeveloped, fish-level brain could sense that a boundary was about to be crossed. A tiny, instinctual trace of doubt\u2014the wisdom of my ancestors whispering through the ages: This might be too weird of a thing to do\u2026 Of course, one of the main features of undeveloped, fish-level brains is poor impulse control, and before I could complete the thought, I was in Richard's living room. I hadn't prepared for this possibility. I'd dreamed of it, sure. But I wasn't expecting it to HAPPEN . So I just stood there for a little while and then retreated to regroup. A concrete objective never emerged, but the missions became bolder and more frequent. I started bringing things back with me. Richard's things. They seemed valuable, somehow. Richard likes these things\u2026. perhaps they contain the secret to Richard\u2026. A nonsensical collection of Richard's possessions slowly accumulated at the back of my toy drawer. This would prove to be my downfall. Long before that, though, my mom noticed that I'd mysteriously disappear sometimes. She wasn't worried yet because she didn't think I knew how to get out of the house, but one day she asked me where I'd been. And I said: \"Hanging out with Richard.\" \"Hanging out\" was a misnomer\u2014Richard had been hanging out by himself and I had been standing in his hallway just out of view\u2014but this was concerning news for my parents. They didn't even know that I knew Richard, let alone that we'd been \"hanging out.\" They went over and knocked on Richard's door and asked him about it, probably with thinly-veiled suspicion regarding Richard being a child predator. And Richard, who was still somehow unaware of all the hanging out we'd been doing, told them he didn't know anything about that. I imagine things were tense for a bit. The suggestion that I'd been hanging out with Richard was disturbing for both my parents and Richard. But the clues piled up. I couldn't control myself. I took more things, bigger things. I also branched over into hiding things for Richard to find. Pretty rocks, pieces of string, letters I'd tried to write. At that age, I didn't know how to spell very many words, so the messages were fairly cryptic: the entire alphabet, followed by the word Mom and a drawing of the sun. Rampant scribbling, hundreds of tiny circles, and... is this a spider?? The spider was supposed to be Richard. I hadn't figured out how many arms and legs people are supposed to have yet, so I just put a whole bunch on there and hoped it was enough. I didn't want him to feel offended because I shortchanged him on legs. It must've come off like being haunted by a defective but well-meaning ghost. The connection should have been obvious. But, when faced with a mystery like, \"Where did my remote control go? Why is there a piece of paper with a child's handwriting on it hiding in the VCR? And how do these rocks keep getting in here?\" almost no rational adult would jump to the conclusion \"because a child has been sneaking in through my cat door and leaving these for me to discover.\" Not even with clues. I don't know what theory Richard came up with to explain it, but it almost certainly wasn't that one. Similarly, when faced with a mystery like \"why does our child keep disappearing? And why has our child been \"hanging out\" with our 40-year-old neighbor?\" almost no rational adult would jump to the conclusion: \"because our child has become obsessed with our 40-year-old neighbor, and 'hanging out' is a loose term to describe the activity of spying.\" The thing that finally blew my cover was stealing Richard's cat. Stealing it wasn't the original plan. The opportunity presented itself, I seized it. It was a strong animal. Getting it into the drawer was difficult. I didn't have a plan for what to do with it, but I knew I had something valuable, and I think the thought process was that I should save it for later. For when I figured out how to capitalize on the probably unlimited potential of this. It lived in the drawer for a while.\u00a0I don't know how long. Hours, probably. And now it is time for a quick fact about cats: cats aren't good secrets, because, under extreme duress, they have the ability to make a sound like: YAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAO My parents eventually realized the sound was coming from inside the house and located the source of it. They weren't expecting to find quite so many of Richard's things. I don't know if they put the pieces together immediately, or processed them individually as they came up\u2014 \"first of all, there's a cat in this drawer; How about that. Next up: there appear to be a considerable number of objects under the cat. This one is a shoe. This one is a piece of bread. This one is a credit card bill. Huh\u2026it's addressed to 'Richard The Neighbor\u2026.'\" \u2014inching closer to the truth with every clue until the ultimate answer to \"What does 'hanging out with Richard' mean?\" was revealed. There was more than enough evidence to answer the question. That's got to be a strange moment for a parent. There's this omnipresent fear of predators and monsters, and you just\u2026 you never quite expect to find out the monster is your kid. They confronted me after a strategy meeting about how the fuck to handle this. That's not something the books prepare you for. There's no chapter on what to do if you suspect your child is a predator.\u00a0There's no Hallmark card for \"Sorry we accused you of being a molester; we didn't realize our kid was sneaking into your house and stealing your spoons and animals and watching you while you sleep. We're really, really sorry.\" That primal instinct I'd felt in Richard's garage flickered back online a little bit. Looking at the objects, and the freaked out cat, and my parents' confused faces, I realized that yeah, maybe this had been a weird thing to do.... I felt like I should explain why I had done this, but I didn't know either. So we all just stood there, feeling weird about ourselves and each other. The cat was stoked to be free, though. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE: You guys have been asking about what happened after the story ended\u2014did my parents apologize to Richard? What did they say? What happened with the cat? I don't know exactly what my parents said in their apology, but I did my own apology later. Afterward, Richard gave me a stuffed rabbit as a peace offering. I named the rabbit \"Bigwig,\" and it was my favorite toy for a very long time (the pink rabbit that shows up in this post and a couple other places in the book is an homage to Bigwig). I'm still trying to find actual Bigwig (I do still have him), but in the meantime, here is a picture of me, my sister, and Bigwig (I believe that's Richard's house in the background): This was probably a year or two after the incident described in the story. And, as you can see, Bigwig was already showing signs of extreme wear and tear. I truly loved him. He went everywhere with me. While searching for photos of Bigwig, I also found this: I didn't draw the cat correctly (in my memory, it's an adult cat), but my mom's caption leads me to believe that this was, in fact, the cat I stole from Richard. Anyway, Richard was (and probably still is) a very kind man. If he somehow reads this and realizes it's him, I hope it makes him feel beautiful. I feel like this gets it across a little better than my early attempts, at least.",
